Any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. When we use the words    intends,   estimates,   predicts,   potential,   continues,   anticipates,   plans,   expects,   believes,   should,   could,   may,   will  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, we are identifying forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning our future drug development plans and projected timelines for the initiation and completion of preclinical and clinical trials; the potential for the results of ongoing preclinical or clinical trials; other statements regarding our future product development and regulatory strategies, including with respect to specific indications; any statements regarding our future financial performance, results of operations or sufficiency of capital resources to fund our operating requirements; and any other statements which are other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to continue to fund and successfully progress internal research and development efforts and to create effective, commercially-viable drugs; our ability to effectively and timely conduct clinical trials; our ability to ultimately distribute our drug candidates; compliance with regulatory requirements; and our capital needs, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.        Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Except as may be required by applicable law, we do not undertake or intend to update or revise our forward-looking statements, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this report as a result of new information or future events or developments. Thus, you should not assume that our silence over time means that actual events are bearing out as expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. You should carefully review and consider the various disclosures we make in this report and our other reports filed with the SEC that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our business. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

     Table of Contents           CELLCEUTIX CORPORATION     NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (Unaudited)       1. Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations        Unaudited Interim Financial Information       The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of Cellceutix Corporation have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted from these statements pursuant to such rules and regulations and, accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes necessary for comprehensive financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.     In the opinion of the management of the Company, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the three month period have been made. Results for the interim period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for the entire fiscal year. When used in these notes, the terms "Company", "we", "us" or "our" mean Cellceutix Corporation.        Basis of Presentation       Cellceutix Corporation ( Cellceutix  or the  Company ) was incorporated as Econoshare, Inc. on August 1, 2005, in the State of Nevada. On December 6, 2007, the Company acquired Cellceutix Pharma, Inc., a privately owned corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 20, 2007. Following the acquisition, the Company changed its name to Cellceutix Corporation. Cellceutix Corporation has no subsidiaries since Cellceutix Pharma, Inc. was dissolved in 2014. The Company is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company and has no customers, products or revenues to date.      The Company s Common Stock is quoted on OTCQB, symbol  CTIX .        Nature of Operations -Overview       We are in the business of developing innovative small molecule therapies to treat diseases with significant medical need, particularly in the areas of cancer, antibiotics and inflammatory disease. Our strategy is to use our business and scientific expertise to maximize the value of our pipeline. We will do this by focusing initially on our lead compounds, Brilacidin, Kevetrin and Prurisol and advancing them as quickly as possible along the regulatory pathway. We will develop the highest quality data and broadest intellectual property to support our compounds.      We currently own all development and marketing rights to our products. In order to successfully develop and market our products, we may have to partner with other companies. Prospective partners may require that we grant them significant development and/or commercialization rights in return for agreeing to share the risk of development and/or commercialization.                 7       
     Table of Contents           2. Liquidity      At September 30, 2016, we had $5.6 million in cash. We have expended substantial funds on the research and development of our product candidates. Our net losses incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amounted to $3.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively, and a working capital (deficit) of approximately $(2.6) million and $(1.9) million, respectively at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.     On March 30, 2015, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC, an Illinois limited liability company ("Aspire Capital") which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $30.0 million of the Company's common stock over the 36-month term of the Purchase Agreement. As of September 30, 2016, the available balance is approximately $20 million.     The Company plans to incur expenses of approximately $19 million over the next twelve months, including approximately $15 million for clinical trials. The Company has limited experience with pharmaceutical drug development. As such, the budget estimate may not be accurate. In addition, the actual work to be performed is not known at this time, other than a broad outline, as is normal with any scientific work. As further work is performed, additional work may become necessary or change in plans or workload may occur. Such changes may have an adverse impact on our estimated budget and on our projected timeline of drug development.      Management believes that the amounts available from Aspire and under the Company s effective shelf registration statement will be sufficient to fund the Company s operations for the next 12 months.     If we are unable to generate enough working capital from our current financing agreement with Aspire Capital when needed or secure additional sources of funding, it may be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending through reductions in staff and delaying, scaling back or stopping certain research and development programs, including more costly Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials on our wholly-owned development programs as these programs progress into later stage development. Insufficient liquidity may also require us to relinquish greater rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms to us and our stockholders than we would otherwise choose in order to obtain up-front license fees needed to fund operations. These events could prevent us from successfully executing our operating plan.      3. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements         Reclassifications        Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Such reclassifications were limited to the Condensed Balance Sheets and did not impact the Condensed Statement of Operations and Condensed Statement of Cash Flows.        Use of Estimates        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include contract research accruals, recoverability of long-lived assets, measurement of stock-based compensation, and the periods of performance under collaborative research and development agreements. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates.                 8       
     Table of Contents             Basic Earnings (Loss) per Share        Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted-average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Common share equivalents consist of stock options, warrants and convertible notes payable. Common share equivalents of 45,036,175 and 44,436,980 were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, because their effect is anti-dilutive.        Accounting for Stock Based Compensation        The stock-based compensation expense incurred by Cellceutix for employees and directors in connection with its stock option plan is based on the employee model of ASC 718, and the fair market value of the options is measured at the grant date. Under ASC 718 employee is defined as  An individual over whom the grantor of a share-based compensation award exercises or has the right to exercise sufficient control to establish an employer-employee relationship based on common law as illustrated in case law and currently under U.S. tax regulations . Our consultants do not meet the employer-employee relationship as defined by the IRS and therefore are accounted for under ASC 505-50.     ASC 505-50-30-11 (previously EITF 96-18) further provides that an issuer shall measure the fair value of the equity instruments in these transactions using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of the following dates, referred to as the measurement date:                  i.    The date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached (a performance commitment); and           ii.    The date at which the counterparty s performance is complete.         We have elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant. Restricted stock is measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. We recognize stock-based compensation using the straight-line vesting method over the requisite service period of the equity awards.      The components of stock based compensation related to stock options in the Company s Statement of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (rounded to nearest thousand):                       9       
     Table of Contents            Recent Accounting Pronouncements         Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted      In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, starting after December 15, 2016; the Company s first quarter of fiscal 2018. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.     In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that defines how companies should report revenues from contracts with customers. The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. It provides companies with a single comprehensive five-step principles based model to use in accounting for revenue and supersedes current revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific and transaction-specific revenue guidance. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. As a result, the new standard would not be effective for the Company until 2019. In addition, the FASB is allowing companies to early adopt this guidance for non-public entities beginning in fiscal year 2017. The guidance permits an entity to apply the standard retrospectively to all prior periods presented, with certain practical expedients, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment. The Company will apply this new guidance when it becomes effective and has not yet selected a transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.     In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right of use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For finance leases: the right-of-use asset and a lease liability will be initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position; interest on the lease liability will be recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income; and repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified within financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable lease payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For operating leases: the right-of-use asset and a lease liability will be initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position; a single lease cost will be recognized, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis; and all cash payments will be classified within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Under Topic 842 the accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP. The amendments in Topic 842 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation ( ASU 2016-09 ). Under ASU 2016-09, entities will be required to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The guidance on employers  accounting for an employee s use of shares to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation and for forfeitures is also changing. For public business entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted, but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on its financial statements and disclosures.       Standards Issued and Adopted      In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The amendments in this ASU apply to reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target can be achieved after the requisite service period. This ASU is the final version of Proposed ASU EITF-13D--Compensation--Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period, which has been deleted. The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. As indicated in the definition of vest, the stated vesting period (which includes the period in which the performance target could be achieved) may differ from the requisite service period. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. Management has adopted this guidance and it did not have a material impact on our condensed financial statements.              4. Other Receivables      Other receivables represent amounts to be reimbursed by vendors.      5. Patents, net      Patents, net consisted of the following (rounded to nearest thousand):           The patents are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets, determined 12-17 years from the date of acquisition.     Amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $91,000 and $97,000, respectively.     At September 30, 2016, the future amortization period for all patents was approximately 9 years to 16 years. Future estimated annual amortization expenses are approximately $270,000 for 2017, $363,000 for each year from 2018 to 2025, $353,000 for the year ending June 30, 2026, $351,000 for the year ending June 30, 2027, $113,000 for the year ending June 30, 2028, $59,000 for the years ending June 30, 2029 to 2032, and $22,000 for year ending June 30, 2033.      6. Accrued Expenses      Accrued expenses consisted of the following (rounded to nearest thousand):                  7. Accrued Salaries and Payroll Taxes   Related Parties And Other      Accrued salaries and payroll taxes consisted of the following (rounded to nearest thousand):            8. Commitments and Contingencies        Lease Commitments        Operating Leases      The Company signed a lease extension agreement with Cummings Properties which began on October 1, 2013. The lease is for a term of five years ending on September 30, 2018, and requires monthly payments of approximately $18,000. Innovative Medical Research Inc., a company owned by Leo Ehrlich and Dr. Krishna Menon, officers of the Company, have co-signed the lease and will sublease 200 square feet of space previously used by the Company and pay the Company $900 per month.     As of September 30, 2016, future minimum lease payments to Cummings Properties required under the non-cancelable operating lease are as follows (rounded to nearest thousand):           Rent expense, net of lease income, under this operating lease agreement was approximately $50,000 for both of three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Before September, 2013, the Company paid rent to KARD for its share of office space and details are shown at Note 9. Related Party Transactions.       Contractual Commitments       The Company has no contractual minimum commitments to Contract Research Organizations as of September 30, 2016. Services are billed to Cellceutix when performed by the vendors.              9. Related Party Transactions        Office Lease       Dr. Menon, a significant shareholder of the Company and its President of Research and a Director, also serves as the Chief Operating Officer and Director of Kard Scientific ( KARD ). On December 7, 2007, the Company began renting office space from KARD, on a month to month basis for $900 per month. This continued through August 2013 and since September 1, 2013, the Company no longer leases space from KARD or pays rent to KARD.      In September 2013, the Company signed a lease extension agreement with Cummings Properties for the Company s offices and laboratories at 100 Cummings Center, Suite 151-B Beverly, MA 01915. The lease is for a term of five years from October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2018 and requires monthly payments of approximately $18,000. Cellceutix had taken over the space occupied by KARD. In addition, Innovative Medical Research Inc., ( Innovative Medical ) a company owned by Leo Ehrlich and Dr. Krishna Menon, officers of Cellecutix, has co-signed the lease and rents approximately 200 square feet of office space, the space previously used by Cellceutix and pays Cellceutix $900 per month, the same amount Cellceutix previously paid KARD. Innovative Medical paid total rent of approximately $3,000, to Cellceutix for both of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the rental payment was offset with the accrued rent owed to KARD.     At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, rent payable to KARD of approximately $29,000 and $32,000, respectively, were included in accrued rent   related party.        Clinical Studies       The Company previously engaged KARD to conduct specified pre-clinical studies. The Company did not have an exclusive arrangement with KARD. The Company no longer uses KARD. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the accrued research and development expenses to KARD was approximately $1,486,000 and this amount was included in accounts payable.         10. Note Payable   Related Party      During the year ended June 30, 2010, Mr. Ehrlich loaned the Company a total of approximately $973,000. A condition for this note was that the Ehrlich Promissory Note A and Ehrlich Promissory Note B be replaced with a new note, Ehrlich Promissory Note C .  The Ehrlich Promissory Note C is an unsecured demand note that bears 9% simple interest per annum and is convertible into the Company s common stock at $0.50 per share. The note requires that the interest rate on the amounts due on Ehrlich Promissory Notes A and B be changed retroactively, beginning October 1, 2009, to 9%. On April 1, 2011, the Company amended the Ehrlich Promissory Note C and agreed to retroactively convert accrued interest of approximately $97,000 through December 31, 2010 into additional principal. During the year ended June 30, 2011, Mr. Ehrlich loaned the Company an additional approximate $997,000 which brought the total balance of the demand note to approximately $2,002,000. During the year ended June 30, 2012, Mr. Ehrlich loaned the Company an additional $20,000 which brought the balance of the demand note to approximately $2,022,000.     On May 8, 2012, the Company did not have the ability to repay the Ehrlich Promissory Note C loan and agreed to change the interest rate on the outstanding balance of principal and interest of approximately $2,248,000, as of March 31, 2012, from 9% simple interest to 10% simple interest, and the Company issued 2,000,000 Equity Incentive Options exercisable at $0.51 per share equal to 110% of the closing bid price of $0.46 per share on May 7, 2012. Options are valid for ten years from the date of issuance.     At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, approximately $77,000 and $40,000, respectively, was accrued as interest expense on this note.      At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, principal balances of the demand note was approximately $2,022,000.               11. Equity Incentive Plans, Stock-Based Compensation and Warrants        Equity Incentive Plans        2009 Stock Option Plan      On April 5, 2009 the Board of Directors of the Registrant adopted the 2009 Stock Option Plan ( the 2009 Plan ). The 2009 Plan permits the grant of 2,000,000 shares of both Incentive Stock Options ( ISOs ), intended to qualify under section 422 of the Code, and Non-Qualified Stock Options.      2010 Equity Incentive Plan      Under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan") the total number of shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance under the 2010 Plan is 45,000,000 shares. Shares of common stock under the 2010 Plan may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares. The term of each stock option shall be fixed as provided, however, an Incentive Stock Option may be granted only within the ten-year period commencing from the effective date of the 2010 Plan and may only be exercised within ten years of the date of grant (or five years in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an optionee who, at the time of grant, owns common stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of the Company).      2016 Equity Incentive Plan      On June 30, 2016, the Board adopted the Cellceutix Corporation 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan"). The 2016 Plan became effective upon adoption by the Board on June 30, 2016.      Up to 20,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be issued under the 2016 Plan (subject to adjustment as described in the 2016 Plan); provided that, no Outside Director (as defined in the 2016 Plan) may be granted awards covering more than 250,000 shares of common stock in any year and no participant shall be granted, during any one year period, options to purchase common stock and stock appreciation rights with respect to more than 4,000,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate or any other awards with respect to more than 2,500,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate. The 2016 Plan permits the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted awards, performance share awards and performance compensation awards to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company and its affiliates.      In connection with adoption of the 2016 Plan, the Board of Directors also approved forms of Incentive Stock Option Agreement for Employees, Non-qualified Stock Option Agreement for Employees, Non-qualified Stock Option Agreement for Non-Employee Directors, Restricted Stock Award Agreement for Employees and Restricted Stock Award Agreement for Non-Employee Directors that will be utilized by the Company to grant options and restricted shares under the 2016 Plan.            The following table summarizes all stock option activity under the above equity incentive plans:           The fair value of options granted for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes model that uses assumptions noted in the following table.              Stock-Based Compensation       The Company recognized approximately $344,000 and $77,000 of total stock-based compensation costs related to stock options awards for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $344,000 of stock based compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included approximately $127,000 of stock options expenses and $217,000 of stock awards (see Note 12).                For the three months ended September 30, 2016        On February 16, 2016, the Company issued 119,424 stock options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share to two consultants for services, valued at approximately $55,000, based on the closing bid price as quoted on the OTC on February 16, 2016 at $1.15 per share. These options were issued with an exercise price of $1.105. One third vested immediately, one third vested in six months (August 11, 2016), and the balance will be vested on February 11, 2017, and will be valid for a period of three years. These options have piggyback registration rights. The Company recorded approximately $9,000 of stock option expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016.     On April 6, 2016, the Company issued 25,000 shares and 25,000 stock options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share to a consultant for service. The stock options valued at approximately $14,000, based on the closing bid price as quoted on the OTC on April 6, 2016 at $1.61 per share. These options were issued with an exercise price of $1.77 and shall vest on April 30, 2017, with a three year option term. These options have piggyback registration rights. The Company recorded approximately $3,000 of stock option expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016.     On June 27, 2016, the Company and Dr. Bertolino entered into an executive employment agreement as our President and Chief Medical Officer, effective on June 27, 2016. Commencing on June 27, 2016, the Company agreed to pay Dr. Bertolino an annual salary of $440,000. In addition, the Company agreed to grant to Dr. Bertolino under the Cellceutix Corporation 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (i) 1,066,667 shares of restricted stock and (ii) a ten-year option to purchase 617,839 shares of the Company's Class A common stock at an exercise price of $1.39 per share. Both shares and options shall vest upon the earliest to occur of the following: (1) 50% upon the first anniversary of the effective date, and the remaining 50% upon the second anniversary of the effective date (2) completion of both a Phase 2b psoriasis study and a Phase 2 oral mucositis study; (3) the Company s common stock closes above $3.00 per share (as may be adjusted for any stock splits or similar actions); (4) the commencement of trading of the Company s common stock on a national securities exchange (e.g. Nasdaq or the NYSE); or (5) upon a Change in Control (as defined in the employment agreement) of the Company. The Company could not conclude that it was probable that these awards will fully vest until the second anniversary of the effective date, because such events listed above are outside the Company s control. The Company will evaluate the probability of these events occurring for each reporting period. The 1,066,667 shares were valued at approximately $1.5 million, which will be amortized over two years to June 27, 2018. The 617,839 stock options were valued at approximately $800,000 and will be exercisable for 10 years at an exercise price of $1.39 per share. They will be amortized over 2 years to June 27, 2018 or sooner if the Company determines that it is probable that one of the events listed above will occur. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded approximately $289,000 of total stock-based compensation, including approximately $188,000 of stock based compensation expense and approximately $101,000 of stock option expense. The Company may award Dr. Arthur P. Bertolino an annual bonus at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company may accelerate the amortization of the $1.5 million stock-based compensation expense if there are conditions which will accelerate the vesting, as mentioned above.      On July 18, 2016, the Company issued 7,500 stock options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock to a consultant for service rendered, exercisable for 3 years at $1.38 per share of common stock.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following discussion and plan of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this Form 10-Q. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. You should review our important note about forward-looking statements preceding the financial statements. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under  Risk Factors  in this Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.       Management s Plan of Operation         Overview        Cellceutix is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies with oncology, dermatology and antimicrobial applications. Cellceutix owns the rights to numerous drug compounds, including Kevetrin (thioureidobutyronitrile), our lead anti-cancer compound; Prurisol (KM-133), which is in development for psoriasis; and Brilacidin, our lead drug in a new class of compounds called defensin-mimetics.     The Company devotes most of its efforts and resources on its compounds already in clinical trials. These trials are evaluating our drug candidates: Kevetrin for the treatment of cancers, Prurisol for the treatment of psoriasis, and Brilacidin for treatments of skin infections, prevention of oral mucositis complicating chemoradiation treatment for cancer, and ulcerative proctitis. We anticipate using our expertise to manage and perform what we believe are the most critical aspects of the product development process which include: (i) design and oversight of clinical trials; (ii) development and execution of strategies for the protection and maintenance of intellectual property rights; and (iii) interactions with regulatory authorities domestically and internationally. We expect to concentrate on product development and engage in a limited way in product discovery, avoiding the significant investment of time and financial resources that is generally required for a promising compound to be identified and brought into clinical trials.        Recent Developments        At this time the Company is focusing its research and development efforts on Kevetrin, Prurisol, Brilacidin, and to a lesser extent on our other anti-bacterial and anti-fungal compounds. Set forth below is an overview our research and development efforts on Kevetrin, Prurisol and Brilacidin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and through the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q:       Kevetrin . The first-in-human clinical trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of Kevetrin was completed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The study enrolled a total of 48 patients, who had failed previous therapies, with various types of advanced solid tumors, including 11 patients with advanced ovarian cancer. A dose-escalation design was used with patients enrolled in 11 cohorts with the maximum dose administered at 750 mg/m2. Kevetrin appeared to be safe and well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities occurring among patients who received even the highest dose of Kevetrin. Cellceutix is currently preparing for a Phase 2a trial of Kevetrin in treating late-stage ovarian cancer, which is anticipated to start in the fourth quarter of calendar 2016 or early 2017. The main objective of this trial focuses on confirming the modulation by Kevetrin of p53 in tumors, as well as monitoring response of tumors to the treatment. Presently and planned concurrent with the Phase 2a trial is the development of an oral formulation of Kevetrin for treating cancer. Pharmacokinetic data collected on Kevetrin during the initial clinical trial demonstrates that the compound has a short half-life of approximately two hours. Kevetrin s short half-life makes it a compelling candidate for an oral drug delivery treatment for the main purpose of allowing simple daily, or multiple-times daily, administrations within or outside the hospital setting. Compared to injectable or intravenous treatments, oral therapy is the preferred drug delivery method of patients. Preliminary laboratory studies are encouraging and support the potential of developing an oral formulation of Kevetrin, but there are no assurances made or implied that Cellceutix will be successful in completing development of an oral formulation of Kevetrin.            Cellceutix s expenditures on Kevetrin were approximately $0.06 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.       Prurisol . The Company completed an initial Phase 2 trial of oral Prurisol for mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. After a detailed analysis, the data showed that the most robust response to Prurisol was in patients with moderate psoriasis in the trial s highest dosing arm (200mg), with no serious adverse events reported in that arm. Among these patients (with the severest form of psoriasis in study), those having a baseline IGA score of 3 ( moderate ), the primary endpoint was met in 46% of patients who received 200 mg of Prurisol per day. These data were derived from analyses of all patients. Benefits were apparent by two weeks and showed further improvement by the end of the study at 12 weeks.     Cellceutix has commenced a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial of Prurisol for approximately 189 subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Daily Prurisol dosage has been increased from 200mg. The treatment group arms are Prurisol 300mg, Placebo, Prurisol 400mg (Ratio 3:3:1) with a treatment duration of 12 weeks.     The Company expects interim analysis top-line results in the second quarter of calendar 2017. Cellceutix s expenditures on Prurisol were approximately $0.4 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. We expect our expenditures on Prurisol to increase for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.      Brilacidin . In February 2016, Cellceutix submitted a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) request, along with a final protocol, to the FDA, for a Phase 3 clinical trial of Brilacidin for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infection (ABSSSI) caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We have received from the FDA comments and considerations for incorporation into our study design, and we are now preparing our response. In addition, multiple other trials of Brilacidin remain ongoing, including a double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial of Brilacidin-OM for the treatment of oral mucositis (OM), and an open-label Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept (P-o-C) trial of Brilacidin for the treatment of ulcerative proctitis (UP) or ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (UPS), two types of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD).     In October 2016, Cellceutix disclosed the first of interim results from the UP/UPS study. The ongoing Phase 2 trial comprises three sequential cohorts (6 patients per cohort), with progressive dose escalation by cohort 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg, respectively. Treatment with Brilacidin by daily enema administration is performed for 42 days. At the time of interim data release, four of six patients in the lowest dosing cohort (50 mg) completed the study. Comparison to baseline after six weeks of treatment showed that all four patients completing the study experienced a clinically meaningful response, as measured by the partial or full Modified Mayo Disease Activity Index (MMDAI), without measurable plasma drug levels. More specifically, measurements of concentrations of Brilacidin in plasma showed all levels, across all time points, to be below the lower limit of quantification (i.e.,  100 ng/mL), which is consistent with limited systemic exposure from administration per rectum by enema. These data suggest that other inflammatory conditions may, likewise, be treated locally and efficaciously with Brilacidin without significant systemic absorption, better ensuring a safe and well-tolerated therapeutic profile. Given Brilacidin s low level of systemic exposure, moderate-to-high dosing of the drug by topical application to the skin might also be supported in treating various dermatology disorders and conditions.     Additional reporting of results from the Phase 2 P-o-C clinical trial of Brilacidin-UP/UPS is anticipated over the coming months, as is an interim analysis in the first half of 2017 of the Phase 2 clinical trial of Brilacidin-OM. Cellceutix s expenditures on Brilacidin were approximately $0.7 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.              Advancing the Platform and Developing Compounds with Activity Against Gram-Negative Bacteria and Fungi      Also in our antibiotic/antifungal portfolio, we are actively testing several of our compounds both in house and through research grants at major universities. In the Gram-negative program, our lead compounds are active in laboratory testing against some of the most problematic pathogens, such as  Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, E. coli  and  Acinetobacter . We have compounds active against drug-susceptible strains as well as multi-drug resistant strains that produce  Klebsiella pneumoniae  carbapenamase (KPC). These are also called carbapenem-resistant  Enterobacteriaceae  (CRE). CRE has been identified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as an  urgent threat  to public health. Importantly, several of our compounds have been shown to be active against CRE in the laboratory. These results were reported in an oral presentation at the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Copenhagen in May 2015.      In our anti-fungal program, we have identified a series of host defense protein (HDP) mimics that are highly active against Candida species and exhibit very low cytotoxicity against mammalian cell types. Additional studies of our HDP mimics suggest possible new treatments for other fungal pathogens, including Aspergillus strains.       Other      In addition to their antimicrobial activity, we are evaluating the use of current and future HDP mimics for disorders of barrier function, where the innate immune system plays a vital role. For these disorders, the goal is to exploit the anti-inflammatory and anti-biofilm properties to restore and maintain healthy skin and mucous membranes, and to treat refractory biofilm-related infections on natural and artificial surfaces. This would include inflammatory or trauma-related conditions of the skin, eyes, GI tract, and respiratory mucosa; exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis; and infections of catheters, valves, and prosthetic joints      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates      Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our accompanying financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses. Our actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.     Please see Note 3 of Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, please see Part II Item 7, "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.      Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements      See Note 3 to the Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the accompanying notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect, if any, on our financial statements.             Results of Operations      We expect to incur losses from operations for the next few years. We expect to incur increasing research and development expenses, including expenses related to additional clinical trials for our proprietary programs. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will also increase in the future as we expand our business development, by adding employees, consultants, additional infrastructure and incurring other additional costs. Based upon our expected rate of expenditures over the next 12 months and beyond, management anticipates seeking additional working capital to meet our anticipated clinical trial obligations.        Revenue        We generated no revenue and incurred operating expenses of $3.0 million and $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.        Research and Development Expenses for Proprietary Programs       Below is a summary of our research and development expenses for our proprietary programs by categories of costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (rounded to nearest thousand):            Research and development expenses for proprietary programs increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to higher spending on our Brilacidin program and Prusisol program.      Stock-based compensation- consultants decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to granting fewer stock awards to consultants in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.     Officers' payroll and payroll tax expenses related to R D department increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to the hiring of our President and Chief Medical Officer who joined us on June 27, 2016.             Employees payroll and payroll tax expenses decreased primarily related to the resignation of one senior employee in our research and development department offset by the hiring of our VP Clinical Services and Project Management.     Stock-based compensation   Officers increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to the stock-based compensation given to our new President and Chief Medical Officer who joined us on June 27, 2016.     Stock-based compensation- Employee increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to the stock-based compensation given to our new VP Regulatory Affairs and our VP Clinical Services and Project Management who joined us in September, 2016.     Our research and development expenses include costs related to preclinical and clinical trials, outsourced services and consulting, officers' payroll and related payroll tax expenses, other wages and related payroll tax expenses, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses. We manage our proprietary programs based on scientific data and achievement of research plan goals. Our scientists record their time to specific projects when possible; however, many activities occurring simultaneously benefit multiple projects and cannot be readily attributed to a specific project. Accordingly, the accurate assignment of time and costs to a specific project is difficult and may not give a true indication of the actual costs of a particular project. As a result, we do not report costs on an individual program basis.        General and Administrative Expenses       General and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and associated fringe benefits not included in cost of research and development expenses for proprietary programs and include other management, business development, accounting, information technology and administration costs, including patent filing and prosecution, recruiting, consulting and professional services, travel and meals, facilities, depreciation and other office expenses.      Below is a summary of our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (rounded to nearest thousand):                    Officers' payroll and payroll tax expenses       Below is a summary of our Officers' payroll and payroll tax expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (rounded to nearest thousand):            There was no change in Officers' payroll and payroll tax expenses for the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Officers' payroll and payroll tax expenses decreased during fiscal 2016 primarily related to a decrease in bonus paid. The officers  payroll and payroll tax expenses represented one officer s annual payroll and payroll tax expenses and 10% of payroll and payroll tax expenses paid for Mr. Menon. The Company recorded 90% of annual payroll paid to Mr. Menon and his payroll tax expenses under Research and Development Expense.        Professional fees       Below is a summary of our Professional fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (rounded to nearest thousand):            Professional fees decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to decrease in professional fee paid to external consultants as the Company hired more internal staff.        Other Income (Expense)       Below is a summary of our other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (rounded to nearest thousand):            There was no change in Interest Income received from banks and interest expenses paid on the note payable   related party (see note 10).        Net Losses       We incurred net losses of $3.0 million and $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively because of the above factors.              Liquidity and Capital Resources         Projected Future Working Capital Requirements   Next 12 Months        As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $5.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $20 million remaining available for stock sales under the terms of the purchase agreement with Aspire Capital, compared to $6.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2016. We anticipate that future budget expenditures will be approximately $19 million over the next 12 months, including approximately $15 million for clinical trials.      We will require additional sources of equity capital during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, to meet our working capital requirements for our planned clinical trials. This assessment is based on current estimates and assumptions regarding our clinical development programs and business needs. Actual working capital requirements could differ materially from this above working capital projection.      Our ability to successfully raise sufficient funds through the sale of equity securities, when needed, is subject to many risks and uncertainties and even if we are successful, future equity issuances would result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Our risk factors are described under the heading "Risk Factors" in Part I Item 1A and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports we file with the SEC.     If we are unable to generate enough working capital from our current financing agreement with Aspire Capital when needed or secure additional sources of funding, it may be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending through reductions in staff and delaying, scaling back or stopping certain research and development programs, including more costly Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials on our wholly-owned development programs as these programs progress into later stage development. Insufficient liquidity may also require us to relinquish greater rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms to us and our stockholders than we would otherwise choose in order to obtain up-front license fees needed to fund operations. These events could prevent us from successfully executing our operating plan.       $75 Million Shelf Registration Statement       The Company has an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, registering the sale of up to $75 million of the Company s securities. The Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a prospectus supplement, dated March 31, 2015, registering up to $30 million of our common stock that have been or may be offered and sold to Aspire Capital from time to time, leaving $45 million available under the Company s effective shelf registration statement.         Aspire Capital Agreement and Other Equity Issuances        On March 30, 2015, the Company entered into a new common stock purchase agreement (the  March 2015 Agreement ) with Aspire Capital which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $30.0 million of the Company's common stock over the 36-month term of the March 2015 Agreement.      During the period from March 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016, the Company had completed sales to Aspire totaling 7,300,000 shares of common stock generating gross proceeds of approximately $10 million relating to this $30 million purchase agreement. The Company has $20 million remaining available for stock sales under the terms of the purchase agreement with Aspire Capital. Other Equity Issuances are disclosed at note 12.              Cash Flows       The following table provides information regarding our cash position, cash flows and capital expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (rounded to nearest thousand):             Operating activities       The increase in net cash used in operating activities of $0.5 million versus the prior-year three-month period was mainly due to increase in our losses from operations of $0.6 million.     Our operating activities used cash of $2.6 million and $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The use of cash in these periods principally resulted from our losses from operations, as adjusted for non-cash charges for stock-based compensation and depreciation, and changes in our working capital accounts.       Investing activities       The decrease in net cash used in investing activities of $0.01 million versus the prior-year three-month period was due to a decrease in acquiring patents of $0.01 million.      During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our investing activities used cash of $0.03 million, including the purchases of patents of $0.03 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, our investing activities used cash of $0.04 million, including the purchases of patents of $0.04 million.       Financing activities       The increase in net cash provided by financing activities of $0.40 million versus the prior-year three-month period was due to an increase in sales of our common stock to Aspire.     During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we raised approximately $1.88 million in net cash proceeds, including $1.88 million in net proceeds from the sale of 1.5 million shares of our common stock to Aspire.     During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we raised approximately $1.51 million in net cash proceeds, including $1.50 million in net proceeds from the sale of 0.7 million shares of our common stock to Aspire and $0.01 million from the exercise of warrants.              Requirement for Additional Working Capital        The Company plans to incur expenses of approximately $19 million over the next twelve months, including approximately $15 million for clinical trials. The Company has limited experience with pharmaceutical drug development. As such, the budget estimate may not be accurate. In addition, the actual work to be performed is not known at this time, other than a broad outline, as is normal with any scientific work. As further work is performed, additional work may become necessary or change in plans or workload may occur. Such changes may have an adverse impact on our estimated budget and on our projected timeline of drug development.      The Company will be unable to proceed with its full planned drug development programs, meet its administrative expense requirements, capital costs and staffing costs without accessing approximately $16 million (as per current management s budgets) of our remaining financing available with Aspire Capital, of approximately $20 million as of the date of this filing, or accessing additional sources of working capital under the Company s effective shelf registration statement.      Contractual Obligations      Below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 30, 2016 (rounded to the nearest thousand):       _________          (1)  The Company signed a lease extension agreement with Cummings Properties which began on October 1, 2013. The lease is for a term of five years ending on September 30, 2018, and requires monthly payments of approximately $18,000. The Company will receive $900 per month from the sublease of 200 square feet of space to Innovative Medical Research Inc., a company owned by Leo Ehrlich and Dr. Krishna Menon, officers of our Company, which is not included in the table above.               (2)  The Company has no contractual minimum commitments to Contract Research Organizations as of September 30, 2016. Services are billed to Cellceutix, when performed by the vendors.          Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.               ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The Company maintains an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy. The primary objectives of our investment policy is to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields. The Company holds investments that are subject to credit risk, but not interest rate risks. The Company does not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Accordingly, the Company does not believe there is any material market risk exposure that would require disclosure under this item.       ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     As of September 30, 2016, management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, as of September 30, 2016, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.      Changes in Internal Controls      There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.      Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures      In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.              PART II. OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS        None       ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS        Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock. There have been no material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.        ITEM 2.

(b)    For purposes of this Agreement,  Cause  shall mean:                       (i)    Executive s willful failure to perform his/her duties (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness);                       (ii)    Executive s willful failure to comply with any valid and legal directive of the Company s Chief Executive Officer;                       (iii)    Executive s engagement in dishonesty, illegal conduct, or gross misconduct, which is, in each case, materially injurious to the Company or its affiliates;                       (iv)    Executive s embezzlement, misappropriation, or fraud, whether or not related to Executive s employment with the Company;                       (v)    Executive s conviction of or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a crime that constitutes a felony (or state law equivalent) or a crime that constitutes a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude and that results in material reputational or financial harm to the Company or its affiliates; or               (vi) Executive s material breach of any material obligation under this Agreement or any other written agreement between Executive and the Company.     For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act on the part of Executive shall be considered  willful  unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that Executive s action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.     Termination of Executive s employment shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until the Company delivers to Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the Board (after reasonable written notice is provided to Executive and Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that Executive has engaged in the conduct described in any of Section 3.1(b)(i)-(vi) above. Except for a failure, breach, or refusal which, by its nature, cannot reasonably be expected to be cured, Executive shall have ten (10) business days from the delivery of written notice by the Company within which to cure any acts constituting Cause; provided however, that, if the Company reasonably expects irreparable injury from a delay of ten (10) business days, the Company may give Executive notice of such shorter period within which to cure as is reasonable under the circumstances, which may include the termination of Executive s employment without notice and with immediate effect. The Company may place Executive on paid leave while it is determining whether there is a basis to terminate Executive s employment for Cause. Any such action by the Company will not constitute Good Reason.               (c)    For purposes of this Agreement,  Good Reason  shall mean the occurrence of any of the following, in each case during the term of Executive s employment without Executive s written consent:                       (i)    a material reduction in Executive s Base Salary other than a general reduction in Base Salary that affects all similarly situated executives in substantially the same proportions;                       (ii)    a material reduction in Executive s target Annual Bonus opportunity;                       (iii)    any material breach by the Company of any material provision of this Agreement or any material provision of any other agreement between Executive and the Company; or                       (iv)    the Company s failure to obtain an agreement from any successor to the Company to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no succession had taken place, except where such assumption occurs by operation of law.         Executive cannot terminate his/her employment for Good Reason unless he/she has provided written notice to the Company of the existence of the circumstances providing grounds for termination for Good Reason within 10 days of the initial existence of such grounds and the Company has had at least 30 days from the date on which such notice is provided to cure such circumstances. If Executive does not terminate his/her employment for Good Reason within 60 days after the first occurrence of the applicable grounds, then Executive will be deemed to have waived his/her right to terminate for Good Reason with respect to such grounds.             3.2 Without Cause or for Good Reason.  Executive s employment hereunder may be terminated by Executive for Good Reason or by the Company without Cause. In the event of such termination, Executive shall be entitled to receive the Accrued Amounts and subject to Executive s compliance with Section 6 of this Agreement and his/her execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company, its affiliates and their respective officers and directors in a form provided by the Company (the   Release  ), which Release shall become effective within the period specified therein (the   Release Execution Period  ), Executive shall be entitled to receive continued Base Salary for ________ following the Termination Date payable in equal installments in accordance with the Company s normal payroll practices, but no less frequently than monthly; provided that, if the Release Execution Period begins in one taxable year and ends in another taxable year, payments shall not begin until the beginning of the second taxable year and provided further that, the first installment payment shall include all amounts of Base Salary that would otherwise have been paid to Executive during the period beginning on the Termination Date and ending on the first payment date if no delay had been imposed.     The treatment of any outstanding equity awards shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the Company s 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the applicable award agreements.      3.3 Death or Disability.                   (a)    Executive s employment hereunder shall terminate automatically upon Executive s death, and the Company may terminate Executive s employment on account of Executive s Disability.                     (b)    If Executive s employment is terminated on account of Executive s death or Disability, Executive (or Executive s estate and/or beneficiaries, as the case may be) shall be entitled to receive the following:                       (i)    the Accrued Amounts; and                       (ii)    a lump sum payment equal to the product of: (A) Executive s target Annual Bonus for the year in which the Termination Date occurs and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days Executive was employed by the Company during the year in which the Termination Date occurs and the denominator of which is the number of days in such year, which shall be paid within 30 days following the Termination Date.         Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, all payments made in connection with Executive s Disability shall be provided in a manner which is consistent with federal and state law.                  (c)    For purposes of this Agreement,  Disability  shall mean Executive is entitled to receive long-term disability benefits under the Company s long-term disability plan, or if there is no such plan, Executive s inability, due to physical or mental incapacity, to perform the essential functions of his/her job, with or without reasonable accommodation, for one hundred eighty (180) days out of any three hundred sixty-five (365) day period or one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days. Any question as to the existence of Executive s Disability as to which Executive and the Company cannot agree shall be determined in writing by a qualified independent physician mutually acceptable to Executive and the Company. If Executive and the Company cannot agree as to a qualified independent physician, each shall appoint such a physician and those two physicians shall select a third who shall make such determination in writing. The determination of Disability made in writing to the Company and Executive shall be final and conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement.                3.4 Change in Control Termination.                   (a)    Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, if Executive s employment hereunder is terminated by Executive for Good Reason or by the Company without Cause (other than on account of Executive s death or Disability), in each case within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control, Executive shall be entitled to receive the Accrued Amounts and subject to Executive s compliance with Section 6 of this Agreement and his/her execution of a Release, Executive shall be entitled to receive the following:                       (i)    a lump sum payment equal to ____ months of Executive s Base Salary for the year in which the Termination Date occurs (or if greater, the year immediately preceding the year in which the Change in Control occurs), which shall be paid within 60 days following the Termination Date; provided that, if the Release Execution Period begins in one taxable year and ends in another taxable year, payment shall not be made until the beginning of the second taxable year; and                       (ii)    a lump sum payment equal to Executive s target Annual Bonus for the fiscal year in which the Termination Date (as determined in accordance with Section 3.6) occurs (or if greater, the year in which the Change in Control occurs), which shall be paid within 60 days following the Termination Date; provided that, if the Release Execution Period begins in one taxable year and ends in another taxable year, payment shall not be made until the beginning of the second taxable year.                     (b)    If Executive timely and properly elects health continuation coverage under COBRA, the Company shall reimburse Executive for the difference between the monthly COBRA premium paid by Executive for himself/herself and his/her dependents and the monthly premium amount paid by similarly situated active executives. Executive shall be eligible to receive such reimbursement until the earliest of: (i) the eighteen-month anniversary of the Termination Date; (ii) the date Executive is no longer eligible to receive COBRA continuation coverage; and (iii) the date on which Executive receives substantially similar coverage from another employer or other source. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company s making payments under this Section 3.4(b) would violate the nondiscrimination rules applicable to non-grandfathered plans under the Affordable Care Act (the  ACA ), or result in the imposition of penalties under the ACA, the parties agree to reform this Section 3.4(b) in a manner as is necessary to comply with the ACA.                     (c)    Notwithstanding the terms of any equity incentive plan or award agreements, as applicable:                       (i)    all outstanding unvested stock options granted to Executive shall become fully vested and exercisable for the remainder of their full term;                       (ii)    all outstanding equity-based compensation awards other than stock options that are not intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ) shall become fully vested and the restrictions thereon shall lapse; provided that, any delays in the settlement or payment of such awards that are set forth in the applicable award agreement and that are required under Section 409A of the Code ( Section 409A ) shall remain in effect; and                       (iii)    all outstanding equity-based compensation awards other than stock options that are intended to constitute performance-based compensation under Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code shall remain outstanding and shall vest or be forfeited in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements, if the applicable performance goals are satisfied.                            (d)    For purposes of this Agreement,  Change in Control  shall mean the occurrence of any of the following after the Effective Date:                       (i)    one person (or more than one person acting as a group) acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with the stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of such corporation;                       (ii)    one person (or more than one person acting as a group) acquires (or has acquired during the twelve-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition) ownership of the Company s stock possessing 50% or more of the total voting power of the stock of such corporation;                       (iii)    a majority of the members of the Board are replaced during any twelve-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the Board before the date of appointment or election; or                       (iv)    the sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets.         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not occur unless such transaction constitutes a change in the ownership of the Company, a change in effective control of the Company, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company s assets under Section 409A.      3.5 Notice of Termination.  Any termination of Executive s employment hereunder by the Company or by Executive (other than termination pursuant to Section 3.3(a) on account of Executive s death) shall be communicated by written notice of termination (  Notice of Termination  ) to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 9.1.      3.6 Termination Date.  Executive s   Termination Date   shall be:                 (a)  If Executive s employment hereunder terminates on account of Executive s death, the date of Executive s death;                         (b)  If Executive s employment hereunder is terminated on account of Executive s Disability, the date that it is determined that Executive has a Disability;                         (c)  If the Company terminates Executive s employment hereunder for Cause, the date the Notice of Termination is delivered to Executive;                         (d)  If the Company terminates Executive s employment hereunder without Cause, the date specified in the Notice of Termination; and                         (e)  If Executive terminates his/her employment hereunder with or without Good Reason, the date specified in Executive s Notice of Termination.

Upon termination of Executive s employment hereunder for any reason, Executive shall be deemed to have resigned from all positions that Executive holds as an officer or member of the Board (or a committee thereof) of the Company or any of its affiliates.      3.8 Section 280G.  If any of the payments or benefits received or to be received by Executive (including, without limitation, any payment or benefits received in connection with a Change in Control or Executive s termination of employment, whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement, or agreement, or otherwise) (all such payments collectively referred to herein as the   280G Payments  ) constitute  parachute payments  within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and would, but for this Section 3.8, be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the   Excise Tax  ), then such 280G Payments shall be reduced in a manner determined by the Company (by the minimum possible amounts) that is consistent with the requirements of Section 409A until no amount payable to Executive will be subject to the Excise Tax. If two economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but are payable at different times, the amounts shall be reduced (but not below zero) on a pro rata basis.     All calculations and determinations under this Section 3.8 shall be made by an independent accounting firm or independent tax counsel appointed by the Company (the   Tax Counsel  ) whose determinations shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and Executive for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations and determinations required by this Section 3.8, the Tax Counsel may rely on reasonable, good faith assumptions and approximations concerning the application of Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code. The Company and Executive shall furnish the Tax Counsel with such information and documents as the Tax Counsel may reasonably request in order to make its determinations under this Section 3.8. The Company shall bear all costs the Tax Counsel may reasonably incur in connection with its services.      4. Proprietary Information Obligations.       4.1 Confidential Information Defined.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:                 (a)  Executive will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for any disclosure of a trade secret that:                             (i)  is made (1) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (2) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or                             (ii)  is made in a complaint or other document filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding.                           (b)  If Executive files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, Executive may disclose the Company s trade secrets to Executive s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if Executive:                             (i)  files any document containing trade secrets under seal; and                             (ii)  does not disclose trade secrets, except pursuant to court order.                     4.5 Work Product.  Executive acknowledges and agrees that all right, title, and interest in and to all writings, works of authorship, technology, inventions, discoveries, processes, techniques, methods, ideas, concepts, research, proposals, materials, and all other work product of any nature whatsoever, that are created, prepared, produced, authored, edited, amended, conceived, or reduced to practice by Executive individually or jointly with others during the period of his/her employment by the Company and relate in any way to the business or contemplated business, products, activities, research, or development of the Company or result from any work performed by Executive for the Company (in each case, regardless of when or where prepared or whose equipment or other resources is used in preparing the same), all rights and claims related to the foregoing, and all printed, physical and electronic copies, and other tangible embodiments thereof (collectively,   Work Product  ), as well as any and all rights in and to US and foreign (a) patents, patent disclosures and inventions (whether patentable or not), (b) trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade names, logos, corporate names, and domain names, and other similar designations of source or origin, together with the goodwill symbolized by any of the foregoing, (c) copyrights and copyrightable works (including computer programs), and rights in data and databases, (d) trade secrets, know-how, and other confidential information, and (e) all other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all registrations and applications for, and renewals and extensions of, such rights, all improvements thereto and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection in any part of the world (collectively,   Intellectual Property Rights  ), shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company.

Executive acknowledges that, by reason of being employed by the Company at the relevant times, to the extent permitted by law, all of the Work Product consisting of copyrightable subject matter is  work made for hire  as defined in 17 U.S.C.   101 and such copyrights are therefore owned by the Company. To the extent that the foregoing does not apply, Executive hereby irrevocably assigns to the Company, for no additional consideration, Executive s entire right, title, and interest in and to all Work Product and Intellectual Property Rights therein, including the right to sue, counterclaim, and recover for all past, present, and future infringement, misappropriation, or dilution thereof, and all rights corresponding thereto throughout the world. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to reduce or limit the Company s rights, title, or interest in any Work Product or Intellectual Property Rights so as to be less in any respect than that the Company would have had in the absence of this Agreement.      4.7 Further Assurances; Power of Attorney.  During and after his/her employment, Executive agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Company to (a) apply for, obtain, perfect, and transfer to the Company the Work Product as well as any and all Intellectual Property Rights in the Work Product in any jurisdiction in the world; and (b) maintain, protect and enforce the same, including, without limitation, giving testimony and executing and delivering to the Company any and all applications, oaths, declarations, affidavits, waivers, assignments, and other documents and instruments as shall be requested by the Company. Executive hereby irrevocably grants the Company power of attorney to execute and deliver any such documents on Executive s behalf in his/her name and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to transfer the Work Product to the Company and further the transfer, prosecution, issuance, and maintenance of all Intellectual Property Rights therein, to the full extent permitted by law, if Executive does not promptly cooperate with the Company s request (without limiting the rights the Company shall have in such circumstances by operation of law). The power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall not be affected by Executive s subsequent incapacity.             4.8 No License.  Executive understands that this Agreement does not, and shall not be construed to, grant Executive any license or right of any nature with respect to any Work Product or Intellectual Property Rights or any Confidential Information, materials, software, or other tools made available to him/her by the Company.      5. Outside Activities During Employment.       5.1 Non-Company Business.  Except with the prior written consent of the Board, Executive will not, during the term of Executive s employment with the Company, undertake or engage in any other employment, occupation or business enterprise, other than ones in which Executive is a passive investor. Executive may engage in civic and not-for-profit activities so long as such activities do not materially interfere with the performance of Executive s duties hereunder.       5.2 No Adverse Interests.  Executive agrees not to acquire, assume or participate in, directly or indirectly, any position, investment or interest known to be adverse or antagonistic to the Company, its business or prospects, financial or otherwise.       6. Covenants.       6.1 Non-Solicitation of Employees.  Executive agrees and covenants not to directly or indirectly solicit, hire, recruit, attempt to hire or recruit, or induce the termination of employment of any then current employee of the Company during the year following his/her separation from the Company.      6.2 Non-Disparagement.  Executive agrees and covenants that he/she will not at any time make, publish or communicate to any person or entity or in any public forum any defamatory or disparaging remarks, comments, or statements concerning the Company or its businesses, or any of its employees, officers or directors. This Section 6.2 does not, in any way, restrict or impede Executive from exercising protected rights to the extent that such rights cannot be waived by agreement or from complying with any applicable law or regulation or a valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or an authorized government agency, provided that such compliance does not exceed that required by the law, regulation, or order.      The Company agrees and covenants that it shall cause its officers and directors to refrain from making any defamatory or disparaging remarks, comments, or statements concerning Executive to any third parties.      7. Dispute Resolution.  To ensure timely and economical resolution of any disputes that may arise in connection with Executive s employment with the Company, as a condition of Executive s employment, Executive and the Company hereby agree that any and all claims, disputes or controversies of any nature whatsoever arising out of, or relating to, this letter, or its interpretation, enforcement, breach, performance or execution, Executive s employment with the Company, or the termination of such employment, shall be resolved, to the fullest extent permitted by law, by final, binding and confidential arbitration conducted before a single arbitrator by JAMS, Inc. (  JAMS  ) or its successor, under the then applicable JAMS arbitration rules (which can be found at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-clauses/). The arbitration shall take place in the county (or comparable governmental unit) in which Executive was last employed by the Company, as determined by the arbitrator; provided, however, that if the arbitrator determines there will be an undue hardship to Executive to have the arbitration in such location, the arbitrator will choose an alternative appropriate location.  Executive and the Company each acknowledge that by agreeing to this arbitration procedure, both Executive and the Company waive the right to resolve any such dispute, claim or demand through a trial by jury or judge or by administrative proceeding.  Executive will have the right to be represented by legal counsel at Executive s expense at any arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator shall: (i) have the authority to compel adequate discovery for the resolution of the dispute and to award such relief as would otherwise be available under applicable law in a court proceeding; and (ii) issue a written statement signed by the arbitrator regarding the disposition of each claim and the relief, if any, awarded as to each claim, the reasons for the award, and the arbitrator s essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator, and not a court, shall also be authorized to determine whether the provisions of this paragraph apply to a dispute, controversy, or claim sought to be resolved in accordance with these arbitration procedures. The Company shall pay all costs and fees in excess of the amount of court fees that Executive would be required to incur if the dispute were filed or decided in a court of law. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prevent either Executive or the Company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any arbitration.              8 Indemnification; D O Insurance.

No provision of this Agreement may be amended or modified unless such amendment or modification is agreed to in writing and signed by Executive and by the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of the Company. No waiver by either of the parties of any breach by the other party hereto of any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by the other party hereto shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any prior or subsequent time, nor shall the failure of or delay by either of the parties in exercising any right, power, or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver thereof to preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power, or privilege.      9.4 Complete Agreement.
