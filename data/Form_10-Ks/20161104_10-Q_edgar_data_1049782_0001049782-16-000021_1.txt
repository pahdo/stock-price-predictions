(1)     Basis of Presentation 
    
  Overview 
    
  Brookline Bancorp, Inc. (the  Company ) is a bank holding company (within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended) and the parent of Brookline Bank, a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank; Bank Rhode Island ( BankRI ), a Rhode Island-chartered financial institution; and First Ipswich Bank ( First Ipswich ), a Massachusetts-chartered trust company (collectively referred to as the  Banks ). The Banks are all members of the Federal Reserve System. The Company is also the parent of Brookline Securities Corp. The Company s primary business is to provide commercial, business, and retail banking services to its corporate, municipal, and individual customers through the Banks and its non-bank subsidiaries. 
    
  Brookline Bank, which includes its wholly-owned subsidiaries BBS Investment Corp., Longwood Securities Corp. and its   84.4%   owned subsidiary, Eastern Funding LLC ("Eastern Funding"), operates   25   full-service banking offices in the greater Boston metropolitan area. BankRI, which includes its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Acorn Insurance Agency, BRI Realty Corp., Macrolease Corporation ("Macrolease"), BRI Investment Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, BRI MSC Corp., operates   19   full-service banking offices in the greater Providence area. First Ipswich, which includes its wholly-owned subsidiaries, First Ipswich Insurance Agency and First Ipswich Securities II Corp., operates   5   full-service banking offices on the north shore of eastern Massachusetts. 
    
  The Company s activities include acceptance of commercial, municipal, and retail deposits; origination of mortgage loans on commercial and residential real estate located principally in Massachusetts and Rhode Island; origination of commercial loans and leases to small and mid-sized businesses; investment in debt and equity securities; and the offering of cash management and investment advisory services. The Company also provides specialty equipment financing through its subsidiaries Eastern Funding, which is based in New York, New York, and Macrolease, which is based in Plainview, New York.  
    
  The Company and the Banks are supervised, examined, and regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("FRB"). As a Massachusetts-chartered saving bank and trust company, Brookline Bank and First Ipswich, respectively, are also subject to regulation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Division of Banks. As a Rhode Island-chartered financial institution, BankRI is also subject to regulation under the laws of the State of Rhode Island and the jurisdiction of the Banking Division of the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation. 
    
  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) offers insurance coverage on all deposits up to   $250,000   per depositor at each of the   three   Banks. As FDIC-insured depository institutions, all three Banks are also secondarily subject to supervision, examination, and regulation by the FDIC. Additionally, as a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank, Brookline Bank is insured by the Depositors Insurance Fund ( DIF ), a private industry-sponsored insurance company. The DIF insures savings bank deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. As such, Brookline Bank offers   100%   insurance on all deposits as a result of a combination of insurance from the FDIC and the DIF. Brookline Bank is required to file periodic reports with the DIF. 
    
  Basis of Financial Statement Presentation 
    
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company presented herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) and disclosures considered necessary for the fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been included. Interim results are not necessarily reflective of the results of the entire year. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.

  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 
  At and for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates based upon changing conditions, including economic conditions and future events. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near-term include the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, the determination of fair market values of assets and liabilities, including acquired loans and leases, the review of goodwill and intangibles for impairment, and the review of deferred tax assets for valuation allowances. 
    
  The judgments used by management in applying these critical accounting policies may be affected by a further and prolonged deterioration in the economic environment, which may result in changes to future financial results. For example, subsequent evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses in future periods, and the inability to collect outstanding principal may result in increased loan and lease losses. 

(2)         Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740)  . This ASU was issued to improve the accounting for income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. For public entities, this ASU is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently assessing the applicability of ASU 2016-16 and has not determined the impact, if any, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)  . This ASU was issued to provide clarification and uniformity on the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230. This amendments presented in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. As of   September 30, 2016  , Management believes that ASU 2016-15 does apply, and has determined the impact of adoption will be minimal. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The intent of this ASU is to replace the current GAAP method of calculating credit losses. Current GAAP uses a higher threshold at which likely losses can be calculated and recorded. The new process will require institutions to account for likely losses that originally would not have been part of the calculation. The calculation will incorporate future forecasting in addition to historical and current measures. For public entities that file with the SEC, this ASU is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU must be applied prospectively to debt securities marked as other than temporarily impaired. A retrospective approach will be applied cumulatively to retained earnings. Early adoption is permitted as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Management has determined that ASU 2016-13 does apply, but has not determined the impact, if any, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.   The intention of this ASU is to provide additional clarification on specific issues brought forth by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board Joint Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition in relation to Topic 606 and revenue recognition. This ASU is to have the same effective date as ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to December 15, 2017. Management has determined that ASU 2016-12 does apply, but has not determined the impact, if any, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This ASU was issued as part of the FASB Simplification Initiative which intends to reduce the complexity of GAAP while improving usefulness to users. There are eight main items in this ASU that contribute to the simplification of share-based accounting. For public entities, this ASU is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Management believes that this ASU applies and is assessing the impact, if any, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  . This ASU was issued to clarify how to recognize revenue

depending on an entities position, in relation to another entity involved, on contracts with customers. The entity can either be a principal party or an agent, and must record revenue accordingly. This ASU is not yet effective. Since this ASU affects ASU 2014-09, and that effective date was deferred, this ASU remains suspended too. Management believes that this ASU applies and is assessing the impact, if any, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases.   This ASU requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheet but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. This ASU also eliminates current real estate-specific provisions for all companies. For lessors, this ASU modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. Management believes that this ASU applies and is assessing the impact, if any, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments.   This ASU significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Management believes that this ASU applies and is assessing the impact, if any, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  . This ASU was issued to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. In effect, public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those period) beginning after December 15, 2017. Management believes that this ASU applies and is assessing the impact, if any, as of   September 30, 2016  .

At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of all investment securities available-for-sale was   $524.3 million  , with a net unrealized gain of   $7.1 million  , compared to a fair value of   $513.2 million   and net unrealized losses of   $4.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   $78.1 million  , or   14.9%   of the portfolio, had gross unrealized losses of   $0.7 million  , compared to   $368.1 million  , or   71.7%  , with gross unrealized losses of   $6.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of all investment securities held-to-maturity was   $78.1 million  , with net unrealized   gains   of   $1.0 million  , compared to a fair value of   $93.7 million   with net unrealized   losses   of   $62.0 thousand   at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   $19.1 million  , or   24.5%   of the portfolio, had gross unrealized losses of   $52.0 thousand  , compared to   $52.3 million  , or   55.8%   with gross unrealized losses of   $0.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Investment Securities as Collateral 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively,   $443.5 million   and   $486.4 million   of investment securities were pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements, municipal deposits, treasury, tax, and loan deposits; swap agreements, and FHLBB borrowings. The decrease in investment securities pledged as collateral was primarily due to a decrease in municipal deposits which require collateral.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment ( OTTI ) 
    
  Investment securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months or twelve months or longer are as follows:

  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 
  At and for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The Company performs regular analysis on the investment securities portfolio to determine whether a decline in fair value indicates that an investment security is OTTI. In making these OTTI determinations, management considers, among other factors, the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost; projected future cash flows; credit subordination and the creditworthiness; capital adequacy; and near-term prospects of the issuers. 
    
  Management also considers the Company s capital adequacy, interest-rate risk, liquidity and business plans in assessing whether it is more likely than not that the Company will sell or be required to sell the investment securities before recovery. If the Company determines that a decline in fair value is OTTI and that it is more likely than not that the Company will not sell or be required to sell the investment security before recovery of its amortized cost, the credit portion of the impairment loss is recognized in the Company's unaudited consolidated statements of income and the noncredit portion is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The credit portion of the OTTI impairment represents the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected future cash flows of the investment security. If the Company determines that a decline in fair value is OTTI and it is more likely than not that it will sell or be required to sell the investment security before recovery of its amortized cost, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the investment security will be recognized in the Company's unaudited consolidated statements of income. 
    
  Investment Securities Available-For-Sale Impairment Analysis 
    
  The following discussion summarizes, by investment security type, the basis for evaluating if the applicable investment securities within the Company s available-for-sale portfolio were OTTI at   September 30, 2016  . Based on the analysis below, it is more likely than not that the Company will not sell or be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of its amortized cost. The Company's ability and intent to hold these investment securities until recovery is supported by the Company's strong capital and liquidity positions as well as its historically low portfolio turnover. As such, management has determined that the investment securities are not OTTI at   September 30, 2016  . If market conditions for investment securities worsen or the creditworthiness of the underlying issuers deteriorates, it is possible that the Company may recognize additional OTTI in future periods.

U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises 
    
  The Company invests in securities issued by U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ), including GSE debt securities, mortgage-backed securities ( MBSs ), and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ). GSE securities include obligations issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC ), the Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA ), the Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLB"), and the Federal Farm Credit Bank. At   September 30, 2016  , only GNMA MBSs and CMOs, and Small Business Administration ( SBA ) commercial loan asset-backed securities with an estimated fair value of   $27.9 million   were backed explicitly by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, compared to   $21.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  .

All securities are performing and backed by the implicit (FHLB / FNMA / FHLMC) or explicit (GNMA / SBA) guarantee of the U.S. Government. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company purchased   $32.3 million   and   $11.8 million   of GSE debentures, respectively.

At   September 30, 2016  ,   17   of the   62   securities in this portfolio were in unrealized loss positions, compared to   45   of the   63   securities at   December 31, 2015  . All securities are performing and backed by the implicit (FHLB / FNMA / FHLMC) or explicit (GNMA) guarantee of the U.S. Government. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company purchased   $3.1 million   in GSE CMOs. The Company did not make any purchases during the same period in   2015  .  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   196   GSE MBSs with a total fair value of   $233.4 million   with a net unrealized   gain   of   $4.4 million  . At   December 31, 2015  , the Company held   186   GSE MBSs with a total fair value of   $229.9 million   with a net unrealized loss of   $0.3 million  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   11   of the   196   securities in this portfolio were in unrealized loss positions, compared to   56   of the   186   securities at   December 31, 2015  . All securities are performing and backed by the implicit (FHLB / FNMA / FHLMC) or explicit (GNMA) guarantee of the U.S. Government. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company purchased   $36.7 million   and   $29.4 million   in GSE MBSs, respectively.  
    
  SBA Commercial Loan Asset-Backed Securities 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   six   SBA securities with a total fair value of   $0.1 million   which approximated cost as compared to   December 31, 2015  , where the Company held   seven   SBA securities with a total fair value of   $0.1 million  , which approximated amortized cost. At   September 30, 2016  ,   five   of the   six   securities in this portfolio were in unrealized loss positions and at   December 31, 2015  ,   six   of the   seven   securities in this portfolio were in unrealized loss positions. All securities are performing and are backed by the explicit (SBA) guarantee of the U.S. Government.  
    
  Corporate Obligations 
    
  From time to time, the Company may invest in high-quality corporate obligations to provide portfolio diversification and improve the overall yield on the portfolio. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   sixteen   corporate obligation securities with a total fair value of   $49.3 million   and unrealized gains of   $1.0 million  . At   December 31, 2015  , the Company held   fifteen   corporate obligation securities with a total fair value of   $46.5 million   and a net unrealized gain of   $0.3 million  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   one   of the   sixteen   securities in this portfolio was in an unrealized loss position. At   December 31, 2015  ,   two   of the   fifteen   securities in this portfolio were in an unrealized loss position. Full collection of the obligation is expected because the financial condition of the issuer is sound, and the issuer has not defaulted on scheduled payments, the obligations are rated investment grade, and the Company has the ability and intent to hold the obligations for a period of time to recover the amortized cost. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company purchased   $5.1 million   and   $9.3 million   in corporate obligations, respectively.

Trust Preferred Securities 
    
  Trust preferred securities represent subordinated debt issued by financial institutions. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   two   trust preferred securities with a total fair value of   $1.3 million   and an unrealized loss of   $0.2 million  . This compares to   two   trust preferred securities with a total fair value of   $1.3 million   and an unrealized loss of   $0.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , both of the securities in this portfolio were in unrealized loss positions. Full collection of the obligations is expected because the financial condition of the issuers is sound,   none   of the issuers has     defaulted on scheduled payments, the obligations are rated investment grade, and the Company has the ability and intent to hold the obligations for a period of time to recover the amortized cost.

  Investment Securities Held-to-Maturity Impairment Analysis 
    
  The following discussion summarizes, by investment security type, the basis for evaluating if the applicable investment securities within the Company s held-to-maturity portfolio were OTTI at   September 30, 2016  . Management does not intend to sell these securities prior to maturity.  
    
  U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises 
  The Company invests in securities issued by GSEs including GSE debentures and MBSs. GSE securities include obligations issued by FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, FHLB, and the Federal Farm Credit Bank.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   six   GSE debentures with a total fair value of   $14.7 million  , and a net unrealized loss of   $29.0 thousand  . At   December 31, 2015  , the Company held   twelve   GSE debentures with a total fair value of   $34.8 million   and a net unrealized loss of   $96.0 thousand  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   four   of the   six   securities in this portfolio were in unrealized loss positions. At   December 31, 2015  ,   nine   of the   twelve   securities in this portfolio were in unrealized loss positions. All securities are performing and backed by the implicit (FHLB/FNMA/FHLMC) or explicit (GNMA/SBA) guarantee of the U.S. Government. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company purchased   $17.7 million   and   $26.9 million   of GSE debentures, respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   eleven   GSE MBSs with a total fair value of   $18.8 million   and a net unrealized gain of   $42.0 thousand  . At   December 31, 2015  , the Company held   ten   GSE MBSs with a total fair value of   $19.0 million   and an unrealized loss of   $0.3 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   two   of the   eleven   securities were in unrealized loss positions as compared to   December 31, 2015  , when   seven   of the   ten   securities in this portfolio were in unrealized loss positions. All securities are performing and backed by the implicit (FHLB/FNMA/FHLMC) or explicit (GNMA) guarantee of the U.S Government. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company purchased   $2.4 million   and   $21.3 million   of GSE MBSs, respectively. 
  Municipal Obligations 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   84   municipal obligation securities with a total fair value of   $44.1 million   and and a net unrealized gain of   $1.0 million  . At   December 31, 2015  , the Company held   72   municipal obligations with a total fair value of   $39.4 million   and a net unrealized gain of   $0.3 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   six   of the   eighty-four   securities in this portfolio were in unrealized loss positions as compared to   December 31, 2015  , where   15   of the   72   securities in this portfolio were in unrealized loss positions.

government obligation security that had matured during the first quarter of 2016. The Company did not make any purchases during the same period in   2015  .  
  Portfolio Maturities 
    
  The final stated maturities of the debt securities are as follows at the dates indicated: 

Actual maturities of debt securities may differ from those presented above since certain obligations, particularly MBS and CMOs, amortize and provide the issuer the right to call or prepay the obligation prior to the scheduled final stated maturity without penalty.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , issuers of debt securities, excluding MBS and CMOs, with an estimated fair value of   $28.9 million   had the right to call or prepay the obligations. Of the   $28.9 million  ,   $3.1 million   matures in 1 - 5 years,   $24.5 million   matures in 6 - 10 years, and   $1.3 million   mature after 10 years. At   December 31, 2015  , issuers of debt securities with an estimated fair value of   $48.5 million   had the right to call or prepay the obligations. Of the   $48.5 million  ,   $15.5 million   matures in 1 - 5 years,   $31.8 million   matures in 6 - 10 years, and   $1.2 million   matures after ten years.  
    
  Investment Security Sales 
    
  Investment security transactions are recorded on the trade date. When investment securities are sold, the adjusted cost of the specific investment security sold is used to compute the gain or loss on the sale. There were no investment securities sold during both the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

The net unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs included in total loans and leases were   $13.9 million   and   $12.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The Company's Banks and subsidiaries lend primarily in eastern Massachusetts, southern New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, with the exception of equipment financing,   31.3%   of which is in the greater New York and New Jersey metropolitan area and   68.7%   of which is in other areas in the United States of America at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   32.8%   of which is in the greater New York and New Jersey metropolitan area and   67.2%   of which in other areas is in the United States of America as of   December 31, 2015  .  
  Competition for the indirect automobile loans increased significantly as credit unions and large national banks entered indirect automobile lending. That competition drove interest rates down and, in some cases, changed the manner in which interest rates are developed, from including a dealer-shared spread to imposing a dealer-based fee to originate the loan. Given this market condition, management ceased the Company's origination of indirect automobile loans in December 2014. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company sold over   90%   of the portfolio for   $255.2 million  , which resulted in a loss of   $11.8 thousand   excluding the impact of the allowance for loan and lease losses.

Accretable Yield for the Acquired Loan Portfolio 
    
  The following table summarizes activity in the accretable yield for the acquired loan portfolio for the periods indicated: 

(1)    Represents changes in interest cash flows due to changes in interest rates on variable rate loans.  
    
  On a quarterly basis and subsequent to acquisition, management reforecasts the expected cash flows for acquired ASC 310-30 loans, taking into account prepayment speeds, probability of default, and loss given defaults. Management compares cash flow projections per the reforecast to the original cash flow projections and determines whether any reduction in cash flow expectations is due to credit deterioration, or if the change in cash flow expectations are related to noncredit events. This cash flow analysis is used to evaluate the need for a provision for loan and lease losses and/or prospective yield adjustments. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , accretable yield adjustments totaling   $1.1 million   and   $1.2 million  , respectively, were made for certain loan pools. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , accretable yield adjustments totaling   $2.4 million   and   $3.0 million  , respectively, were made for certain loan pools. These prospective accretable yield adjustments, which are subject to continued re-assessment, will be recognized over the remaining lives of those pools. 
    
  The aggregate remaining nonaccretable difference applicable to acquired loans and leases totaled   $2.2 million   and   $2.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Loans and Leases Pledged as Collateral 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively,   $1.9 billion   and   $1.8 billion   of loans and leases were pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements, municipal deposits, treasury, tax and loan deposits; swap agreements, and FHLB borrowings. The Banks did not have any outstanding FRB borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

The liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in other liabilities, was   $1.3 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and   $1.4 million   at   September 30, 2015  . These changes reflect changes in the estimate of loss exposure associated with certain unfunded credit commitments.   No   credit commitments were charged off against the liability account in the three-month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Provision for Credit Losses 
    
  The provision for credit losses are set forth below for the periods indicated: 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Methodology 
    
  Management has established a methodology to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses that assesses the risks and losses inherent in the portfolio. Additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses are made by charges to the provision for credit losses. Losses on loans and leases are charged off against the allowance when all or a portion of a loan or lease is considered uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries on loans previously charged off, if any, are credited to the allowance when realized. 
    
  Management uses a consistent and systematic process and methodology to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis. For purposes of determining the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Company has segmented all loans and leases in the portfolio by product type into the following segments: (1) commercial real estate loans, (2) commercial loans and leases, and (3) consumer loans. Portfolio segments are further disaggregated into classes based on the associated risks within the segments. Commercial real estate loans are divided into   three   classes: commercial real estate loans, multi-family mortgage loans, and construction loans. Commercial loans and leases are divided into   three   classes: commercial loans, equipment financing, and loans to condominium associations. Consumer loans are divided into   four   classes: residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, indirect automobile loans, and other consumer loans. A formula-based credit evaluation approach is applied to each group, coupled with an analysis of certain loans for impairment. For each class of loan, management makes significant judgments in selecting the estimation method that fits the credit characteristics of its class and portfolio segment as set forth below. 
    
   The general allowance related to loans collectively evaluated for impairment is determined using a formula-based approach utilizing the risk ratings of individual credits and loss factors derived from historic portfolio loss rates, which include estimates of incurred losses over an estimated loss emergence period ( LEP ). The LEP was generated utilizing a charge-off look-back analysis which studied the time from the first indication of elevated risk of repayment (or other early event indicating a problem) to eventual charge-off to support the LEP considered in the allowance calculation. This reserving methodology established the approximate number of months of LEP that represents incurred losses for each portfolio. In addition to quantitative measures, relevant qualitative factors include, but are not limited to: (1) levels and trends in past due and impaired loans, (2) levels and trends in charge-offs, (3) changes in underwriting standards, policy exceptions, and credit policy, (4) experience of lending management and staff, (5) economic trends, (6) industry conditions, (7) effects of changes in credit concentrations, (8) interest rate environment, and (9) regulatory and other changes. The general allowance related to the acquired loans collectively evaluated for impairment is determined based upon the degree, if any, of deterioration in the pooled loans subsequent to acquisition. The qualitative factors used in the determination are the same as those used for originated loans. 
    
  During 2015, the Company enhanced and refined its general allowance methodology to provide a more precise quantification of probable losses in the portfolio. Under the enhanced methodology, management combined the historical loss histories of the Banks to generate a single set of ratios. Management believes it is appropriate to aggregate the ratios as the

     Table of Contents  
  BROOKLINE BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

  At and for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Banks share common environmental factors, operate in similar markets, and utilize common underwriting standards in accordance with the Company's Credit Policy. In prior periods, a historical loss history applicable to each Bank was used.  
    
  Management employed a similar analysis for the consolidation of the qualitative factors as it did for the quantitative factors. Again, management believes the realignment of the existing nine qualitative factors used at each of the Banks into a single group of factors for use across the Company is appropriate based on the commonality of environmental factors, markets, and underwriting standards among the Banks. In the periods prior to the three months ended September 30, 2015, each of the Banks utilized a set of qualitative factors applicable to each Bank. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a portfolio of approximately   $36.0 million   in loans secured by taxi medallions issued by the cities of Boston and Cambridge. Application-based mobile ride services, such as Uber and Lyft, have generated increased competition in the transportation sector, resulting in a reduction in taxi utilization and, as a result, a reduction in the collateral value and credit quality of taxi medallion loans. This has increased the likelihood that loans secured by taxi medallions may default, or that the borrowers may be unable to repay these loans at maturity, potentially resulting in an increase in past due loans, troubled debt restructurings, and charge-offs. Therefore, beginning with the three months ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company s allowance calculation included a further segmentation of the commercial loans and leases to reflect the increased risk in the Company s taxi medallion portfolio. This allowance calculation segmentation represents management s estimations of the risks associated with the portfolio.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had an allowance for loan and lease losses associated with taxi medallion loans of   $6.0 million   of which   $4.7 million   were specific reserves and   $1.3 million   was a general reserve. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a general reserve for loan and lease losses associated with taxi medallion loans of   $4.3 million  . The total troubled debt restructured loans and leases secured by taxi medallions increased by   $8.8 million   from   $1.3 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $10.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The total loans and leases secured by taxi medallions that were placed on nonaccrual increased to   $18.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   zero   at   December 31, 2015  . However, further declines in demand for taxi services or further deterioration in the value of taxi medallions may result in higher delinquencies and losses beyond that provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses.  
    
  Based on the refinements to the Company s allowance methodology discussed above, management determined that the potential risks anticipated by the unallocated allowance are now incorporated into the allowance methodology, making the unallocated allowance unnecessary. In the periods prior to the three months ended September 30, 2015, the unallocated allowance was used to recognize the estimated risk associated with the allocated general and specific allowances. It incorporated management s evaluation of existing conditions that were not included in the allocated allowance determinations and provided for losses that arise outside of the ordinary course of business.  
    
  Specific valuation allowances are established for impaired originated loans with book values greater than the discounted present value of expected future cash flows or, in the case of collateral-dependent impaired loans, for any excess of a loan's book balance greater than the fair value of its underlying collateral. Specific valuation allowances are established for acquired loans with deterioration in the discounted present value of expected future cash flows since acquisitions or, in the case of collateral dependent impaired loans, for any increase in the excess of a loan's book balance greater than the fair value of its underlying collateral. A specific valuation allowance for losses on troubled debt restructured loans is determined by comparing the net carrying amount of the troubled debt restructured loan with the restructured loan's cash flows discounted at the original effective rate. Impaired loans are reviewed quarterly with adjustments made to the specific reserve as necessary. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , management believes that the methodology for calculating the allowance is sound and that the allowance provides a reasonable basis for determining and reporting on probable losses in the Company s loan portfolios. 
    
  The general allowance for loan and lease losses was   $52.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $53.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The general portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses   decreased   by   $0.5 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily driven by the decrease in historical loss factors applied to commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolios and the improvement of credit risk ratings of loans within the commercial real estate and commercial portfolios, offset by the continued growth in the Company's loan portfolios.

The specific allowance for loan and lease losses was   $6.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The specific allowance   increased     $2.7 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the restructure of certain taxi medallion loans and changes in the collateral values of taxi medallions. 
    
  Credit Quality Assessment 
    
  At the time of loan origination, a rating is assigned based on the financial strength of the borrower and the value of assets pledged as collateral. The Company continually monitors the asset quality of the loan portfolio using all available information. The officer responsible for handling each loan is required to initiate changes to risk ratings when changes in facts and circumstances occur that warrant an upgrade or downgrade in a loan rating. Based on this information, loans demonstrating certain payment issues or other weaknesses may be categorized as delinquent, impaired, nonperforming and/or put on nonaccrual status. Additionally, in the course of resolving such loans, the Company may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans to match the borrower s ability to repay the loan based on their current financial condition. If a restructured loan meets certain criteria, it may be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring. 
    
  The Company reviews numerous credit quality indicators when assessing the risk in its loan portfolio. For the commercial real estate, multi-family mortgage, construction, commercial, equipment financing, condominium association, and other consumer loan and lease classes, the Company utilizes an eight-grade loan rating system, which assigns a risk rating to each borrower based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors associated with a loan transaction. Factors considered include industry and market conditions, position within the industry, earnings trends, operating cash flow, asset/liability values, debt capacity, guarantor strength, management and controls, financial reporting, collateral, and other considerations. In addition, the Company s independent loan review group evaluates the credit quality and related risk ratings of the commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios. The results of these reviews are reported to the Board of Directors. For consumer loans, the Company primarily relies on payment status for monitoring credit risk. 
    
  The ratings categories used for assessing credit risk in the commercial real estate, multi-family mortgage, construction, commercial, equipment financing, condominium association and other consumer loan and lease classes are defined as follows: 
    
  1-4 Rating   Pass 
    
  Loan rating grades  1  through  4  are classified as  Pass,  which indicates borrowers are performing in accordance with the terms of the loan and are less likely to result in losses due to the capacity of the borrowers to pay and the adequacy of the value of assets pledged as collateral. 
    
  5 Rating   Other Asset Especially Mentioned ( OAEM ) 
    
  Borrowers exhibit potential credit weaknesses or downward trends deserving management s attention. If not checked or corrected, these trends can weaken the Company s asset position. While potentially weak, currently these borrowers are marginally acceptable; no loss of principal or interest is envisioned. 
    
  6 Rating   Substandard 
    
  Borrowers exhibit well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the orderly liquidation of debt. Substandard loans may be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors or by the collateral pledged, if any. Normal repayment from the borrower is in jeopardy. Although no loss of principal is envisioned, there is a distinct possibility that a partial loss of interest and/or principal will occur if the deficiencies are not corrected. Collateral coverage may be inadequate to cover the principal obligation. 
    
  7 Rating   Doubtful 
    
  Borrowers exhibit well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the orderly liquidation of debt with the added provision that the weaknesses make collection of the debt in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Serious problems exist to the point where partial loss of principal is likely.

Commercial Real Estate Loans     At   September 30, 2016  , loans outstanding in the   three   classes within this segment expressed as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding were as follows: commercial real estate loans     38.3%  ; multi-family mortgage loans     13.2%  ; and construction loans     2.6%  . 
    
  Loans in this portfolio that are on nonaccrual status and/or risk-rated  substandard  or worse are evaluated on an individual loan basis for impairment. For non-impaired commercial real estate loans, loss factors are applied to outstanding loans by risk rating for each of the three classes in the portfolio. The factors applied are based primarily on historic loan loss experience and an assessment of internal and external factors and other relevant information. 
    
  Commercial Loans and Leases     At   September 30, 2016  , loans and leases outstanding in the   three   classes within this segment expressed as a percent of total loans and leases outstanding were as follows: commercial loans and leases     12.2%  ; equipment financing loans     14.4%  ; and loans to condominium associations     1.0%  .

Significant risk characteristics related to the residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios are the geographic concentration of the properties financed within selected communities in the greater Boston and Providence metropolitan areas. The payment status and loan-to-value ratio are the primary credit quality indicators used for residential mortgage loans and home equity loans. Generally, loans are not made when the loan-to-value ratio exceeds   80%   unless private mortgage insurance is obtained and/or there is a financially strong guarantor. Consumer loans that become 90 days or more past due, or are placed on nonaccrual regardless of past due status, are reviewed on an individual basis for impairment by assessing the net realizable value of underlying collateral and the economic condition of the borrower.  
    
  Impaired Loans and Leases 
    
  A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due (both interest and principal) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company has defined the population of impaired loans to include nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructured loans. 
    
  When the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan or lease is in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual status, all payments are applied to principal, under the cost recovery method. When the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan or lease is not in doubt and the loan or lease is on nonaccrual status, contractual interest is credited to interest income when received, under the cash basis method. 
    
  The following tables include the recorded investment and unpaid principal balances of impaired loans and leases with the related allowance amount, if applicable, for the originated and acquired loan and lease portfolios at the dates indicated. Also presented are the average recorded investments in the impaired loans and leases and the related amount of interest recognized during the period that the impaired loans were impaired.

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans and Leases 
    
  A specific valuation allowance for losses on troubled debt restructured loans is determined by comparing the net carrying amount of the troubled debt restructured loan with the restructured loan's cash flows discounted at the original effective rate. 
    
  The following table sets forth information regarding troubled debt restructured loans and leases at the dates indicated: 

Total troubled debt restructuring loans and leases   increase  d by   $9.1 million   to   $32.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $22.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to   $8.8 million   of taxi medallion loans which were restructured under the definition of a troubled debt restructuring and placed on nonaccrual during the first nine months of 2016.

(7)                     Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
    
  Comprehensive income (loss) represents the sum of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company s other comprehensive income (loss) include the following two components: (1) unrealized holding gains (losses) on investment securities available-for-sale, and (2) adjustment of accumulated obligation for postretirement benefits. 
    
  Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component, net of tax, were as follows for the periods indicated: 

The Company did   not   reclassify any amounts out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   and   September 30,     2015  , respectively.

(8)       Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
    
  The Company may use interest-rate contracts (swaps, caps, and floors) as part of its interest-rate risk management strategy. These agreements are entered into as hedges against future interest-rate fluctuations on specifically identified assets or liabilities. The Company did not have derivative fair value hedges or derivative cash flow hedges at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative but rather, result from a service the Company provides to certain commercial banking customers for a fee. The Company executes interest-rate swaps with certain commercial banking customers to aid them in managing their interest-rate risk. These contracts allow the commercial banking customers to convert floating-rate loan payments to fixed-rate loan payments. The credit risks associated with the interest-rate swaps entered into with our commercial banking customers are consistent with those involved in extending loans. These transactions are subject to the Company's credit policy including collateral requirements consistent with the Company's assessment of the customers' credit quality.  
    
  The Company concurrently enters into offsetting swaps with a third-party financial institution, effectively minimizing its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. The third-party financial institution exchanges the customer s fixed-rate loan payments for floating-rate loan payments.  
    
  As the interest-rate swaps associated with this program do not meet hedge accounting requirements and the requirement of the underlying collateral of the customer swaps, the fair value of the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are not materially different and do not significantly impact the Company s results of operations. The Company had   107   interest-rate swaps related to this program with an aggregate notional amount of   $747.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   64   interest-rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of   $490.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Asset derivatives and liability derivatives are included in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets, respectively. The table below presents the fair value and classification of the Company s derivative financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Certain derivative agreements contain provisions that require the Company to pledge collateral (in the form of financial instruments and/or cash) if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. The Company had pledged collateral of   $37.3 million   and   $14.7 million   in the normal course of business at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

The tables below present the offsetting of derivatives and amounts subject to master netting agreements not offset in the unaudited consolidated balance sheet at the dates indicated. 

The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain credit-risk-related contingent provisions. These provisions provide the counterparty with the right to terminate its derivative positions and require the Company to settle its obligations under the agreements if the Company defaults on certain of its indebtedness or if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution.  

(9)       Stock Based Compensation 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   three   active recognition and retention plans: the 2003 Recognition and Retention Plan (the "2003 RRP") with   1,250,000   authorized shares, the 2011 Restricted Stock Award Plan (the "2011 RSA") with   500,000   authorized shares, and the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") with   1,750,000   authorized shares. The 2003 RRP, the 2011 RSA, and the 2014 Plan are collectively referred to as the "Plans". The purpose of the Plans is to promote the long-term financial success of the Company and its subsidiaries by providing a means to attract, retain and reward individuals who contribute to such success and to further align their interests with those of the Company's stockholders.  
    
  Of the awarded shares, generally   50%   vest ratably over   three   years with one-third of such shares vesting at each of the first, second, and third anniversary dates of the awards. These are referred to as "time-based shares". The remaining   50%   of each award has a cliff vesting schedule and will vest   three   years after the award date based on the level of the Company's achievement of identified performance targets in comparison to the level of achievement of such identified performance targets by a defined peer group of financial institutions. These are referred to as "performance-based shares". The specific performance measure targets relate to return on assets, return on tangible equity, asset quality, and total shareholder return. Generally, if a participant leaves the Company prior to the third anniversary date of an award, any unvested shares are forfeited. Dividends declared with respect to shares awarded are held by the Company and paid to the participant only when the shares vest. 
    
  Under all the Plans, shares of the Company's common stock are reserved for issuance as restricted stock awards to officers, employees, and non-employee directors of the Company. Shares issued upon vesting may be either authorized but unissued shares or reacquired shares held by the Company as treasury shares. Any shares not issued because vesting requirements are not met will be retired back to treasury and be made available again for issuance under the Plans.  
    
  During the three months and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   134,809   shares and   136,139   shares were issued upon satisfaction of required conditions of the Plans, net of shares withheld to cover taxes, respectively. This compared to   107,133   shares, net and   112,553   shares, net during three months and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

Investment Securities Available-for-Sale 
    
  The fair value of investment securities is based principally on market prices and dealer quotes received from third-party and nationally-recognized pricing services for identical investment securities such as U.S. Treasury and agency securities. The Company's marketable equity securities are priced this way and are included in Level 1. These prices are validated by comparing the primary pricing source with an alternative pricing source when available. When quoted market prices for identical securities are unavailable, the Company uses market prices provided by independent pricing services based on recent trading activity and other observable information, including but not limited to market interest-rate curves, referenced credit spreads, and estimated prepayment speeds where applicable. These investments include GSE debentures, GSE mortgage-related securities, SBA commercial loan asset backed securities, corporate debt securities, and trust preferred securities, all of which are included in Level 2. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, none of the investment securities available-for-sale were valued using pricing models included in Level 3.  
    
  Additionally, management reviews changes in fair value from period to period and performs testing to ensure that prices received from the third parties are consistent with management's expectation of the market. Changes in the prices obtained from the pricing service are analyzed on a month to month basis, taking into consideration changes in market conditions including changes in mortgage spreads, changes in U.S. Treasury security yields, and changes in generic pricing of   15  -year and   30  -year securities. Additional analysis may include a review of prices provided by other independent parties, a yield analysis, a review of average life changes using Bloomberg analytics, and a review of historical pricing for a particular security.  
    
  Interest-Rate Swaps 
    
  The fair values for the interest-rate swap assets and liabilities represent a Level 2 valuation and are based on settlement values adjusted for credit risks associated with the counterparties and the Company and observable market interest rate curves. Credit risk adjustments consider factors such as the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties, its net exposures, and remaining contractual life. To date, the Company has not realized any losses due to a counterparty s inability to pay any net uncollateralized position. See also Note 8,  Derivatives and Hedging Activities.

There were no transfers between levels for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis during the   three and nine months ended  ,   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
    
  The tables below summarize assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at the dates indicated: 

Collateral-Dependent Impaired Loans and Leases 
    
  For nonperforming loans and leases where the credit quality of the borrower has deteriorated significantly, fair values of the underlying collateral is estimated using purchase and sales agreements (Level 2), comparable sales, or recent appraisals (Level 3), adjusted for selling costs and other expenses. 
    
  Other Real Estate Owned 
    
  The Company records OREO at the lower of cost or fair value. In estimating fair value, the Company utilizes purchase and sales agreements (Level 2) or comparable sales, recent appraisals or cash flows discounted at an interest rate commensurate with the risk associated with these cash flows (Level 3), adjusted for selling costs and other expenses. 
    
  Repossessed Assets 
    
  Repossessed assets are carried at estimated fair value less costs to sell based on auction pricing (Level 2).

The table below presents quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for assets measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis at the dates indicated. 

(1) Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral. The Company may also use another available source of collateral assessment to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the collateral. Appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic factors and estimated liquidation expenses. The range of the unobservable inputs used may vary but is generally   0%   -   10%   on the discount for costs to sell and   0%   -   15%   on appraisal adjustments. 
    
  Summary of Estimated Fair Values of Financial Instruments 
    
  The following table presents the carrying amount, estimated fair value, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company s financial instruments at the dates indicated. This table excludes financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value. Financial assets for which the fair value approximates carrying value include cash and cash equivalents, FHLBB and FRB stock, and accrued interest receivable. Financial liabilities for which the fair value approximates carrying value include non-maturity deposits, short-term borrowings, and accrued interest payable.

Investment Securities Held-to-Maturity 
    
  The fair values of certain investment securities held-to-maturity are estimated using market prices provided by independent pricing services based on recent trading activity and other observable information, including but not limited to market interest-rate curves, referenced credit spreads, and estimated prepayment speeds, where applicable. These investments include GSE debentures, GSE MBSs, and municipal obligations, all of which are included in Level 2. Additionally, fair values of foreign government obligations are based on comparisons to market prices of similar securities and are considered to be Level 3. 
    
  Loans Held-for-Sale 
    
  Fair value is measured using quoted market prices when available. These assets are typically categorized as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, comparable market values may be utilized. These assets are typically categorized as Level 2.  
    
  Loans and Leases 
    
  The fair values of performing loans and leases are estimated by segregating the portfolio into its primary loan and lease categories commercial real estate mortgage, multi-family mortgage, construction, commercial, equipment financing,

condominium association, indirect automobile, residential mortgage, home equity, and other consumer. These categories were further disaggregated based on significant financial characteristics such as type of interest rate (fixed / variable) and payment status (current / past-due). The Company discounts the contractual cash flows for each loan category using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar quality and incorporates estimates of future loan prepayments. This method of estimating fair value does not incorporate the exit price concept of fair value. 
    
  Deposits 
    
  The fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (demand, NOW, savings and money market savings accounts) are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. The fair value of certificates of deposit represents contractual cash flows discounted using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities. The fair value estimates for deposits do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the Company s core deposit relationships (deposit-based intangibles). 
    
  Borrowed Funds 
    
  The fair value of federal funds purchased is equal to the amount borrowed. The fair value of FHLBB advances and repurchase agreements represents contractual repayments discounted using interest rates currently available for borrowings with similar characteristics and remaining maturities. The fair values reported for retail repurchase agreements are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rates used are representative of approximate rates currently offered on borrowings with similar characteristics and maturities. The fair values reported for subordinated deferrable interest debentures are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rates used are representative of approximate rates currently offered on instruments with similar terms and maturities. 

(12)           Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments 
    
  The Company is party to off-balance-sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include loan commitments, standby and commercial letters of credit, and interest-rate swaps. According to GAAP, these financial instruments are not recorded in the financial statements until they are funded or related fees are incurred or received. 
    
  The contract amounts reflect the extent of the involvement the Company has in particular classes of these instruments. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by a counterparty is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. The Company uses the same policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

Financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk at the dates indicated follow: 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee by the customer. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. 
    
  Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party. These standby and commercial letters of credit are primarily issued to support the financing needs of the Company s commercial customers. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. 
  The liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in other liabilities, was   $1.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Company enters into back-to-back interest rate swaps with commercial customers and third-party financial institutions. These swaps allow the Company to offer long-term fixed-rate commercial loans while mitigating the interest-rate risk of holding those loans. In a back-to-back interest rate swap transaction, the Company lends to a commercial customer on a floating-rate basis and then enters into an interest rate swap with that customer. Concurrently, the Company enters into an offsetting swap with a third-party financial institution, effectively minimizing its net interest-rate risk exposure resulting from such transactions. 
  The fair value for both interest rate swap assets and liabilities was   $24.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The fair value of interest rate swap assets and liabilities was   $8.7 million   and   $8.8 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  .  
  Lease Commitments 
   The Company leases certain office space under various noncancellable operating leases. These leases have original terms ranging from   5   years to over   25   years. Certain leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses which can increase rental expenses based principally on the consumer price index and fair market rental value provisions.

A summary of future minimum rental payments under such leases at the dates indicated follows: 

The leases contain escalation clauses for real estate taxes and other expenditures. Total rent expense was   $1.3 million   and   $1.4 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . Total rental expense was   $3.9 million   and   $4.0 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The reduction in rent expense was attributable to the Company entering into   two   new sublease agreements on properties that had been previously vacated.  
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  There are various outstanding legal proceedings in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, after consulting with legal counsel, the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the Company are not expected to be affected materially by the outcome of such proceedings.

Introduction 
    
  The Company, a Delaware corporation, operates as a multi-bank holding company for Brookline Bank and its subsidiaries, Bank Rhode Island ( BankRI ) and its subsidiaries, First Ipswich Bank ( First Ipswich ) and its subsidiaries, and Brookline Securities Corp. 
    
  As a commercially-focused financial institution with   49   full-service banking offices throughout greater Boston, the north shore of Massachusetts, and Rhode Island; the Company, through Brookline Bank, BankRI and First Ipswich (the  Banks ), offers a wide range of commercial, business, and retail banking services including a full complement of cash management products, on-line and mobile banking services, consumer and residential loans, and investment services, designed to meet the financial needs of small to mid-sized businesses and individuals throughout central New England. Specialty lending activities include equipment financing primarily in the New York and New Jersey metropolitan area. 
    
  The Company focuses its business efforts on the profitable growth of its commercial lending businesses, both organically and through acquisitions. The Company s customer focus, multi-bank structure, and risk management are integral to its organic growth strategy and serve to differentiate the Company from its competitors. As full-service financial institutions, the Banks and their subsidiaries focus on the continued acquisition of well-qualified customers, the deepening of long-term banking relationships through a full complement of products, excellent customer service, and strong risk management.  
    
  The Company manages the Banks under uniform strategic objectives, with one set of uniform policies consistently applied by one executive management team. Within this environment, the Company believes that the ability to make customer decisions locally enhances management's motivation, service levels, and consequently the Company's financial results. As such, while most back-office functions are consolidated at the holding company level, branding and decision-making, including credit decisioning and pricing, remain largely local in order to better meet the needs of bank customers and further motivate the Banks  commercial, business, and retail bankers.

Executive Overview 
    
  Growth 
    
  Total assets of   $6.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016     increased     $338.0 million  , or   7.5%   on an annualized basis, from   December 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily driven by an increase in loans and leases. 
    
  Total loans and leases of   $5.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016     increased     $336.8 million  , or   9.0%   on an annualized basis, from   $5.0 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The Company s commercial loan portfolios, which are comprised of commercial real estate loans and commercial loans and leases, totaled   $4.4 billion  , or   81.7%   of total loans and leases, at   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $315.6 million  , or   10.4%   on an annualized basis, from   $4.0 billion  , or   80.9%   of total loans and leases, at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Total deposits of   $4.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016     increased     $258.9 million   from   December 31, 2015  . Core deposits, defined as the sum of demand checking, NOW, money market, and savings accounts, increased at a   10.0%   annualized rate during the first   nine   months of   2016  .  
    
  Asset Quality 
    
  The ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was   1.10%   and   1.14%   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The allowance for loan and lease losses related to originated loans and leases as a percentage of total originated loans and leases was   1.15%   and   1.20%   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company continued to employ its historical underwriting methodology throughout the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Nonperforming assets at   September 30, 2016   totaled   $38.7 million  , or   0.61%   of total assets, as compared with   $20.7 million  , or   0.34%   of total assets, at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to $19.0 million of taxi medallion loans which were placed on non-accrual and downgraded during the first nine months of 2016. Net charge-offs decreased $3.5 million to $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $4.0 million for the   second quarter   of 2016 due primarily to a charge-off of $3.4 million on a relationship in the second quarter of 2016 which had a specific reserve of $3.3 million that was recorded in 2015. 
    
  Capital Strength 
    
  The Company is a "well-capitalized" bank holding company as defined in the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation Y. The Company's common equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was   10.51%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   10.62%   at   December 31, 2015  , while the Company s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was   9.13%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   9.37%   at   December 31, 2015  . The Company's Tier 1 Risk-Based Ratio was   10.81%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   10.91%   at   December 31, 2015   while the Total Risk-Based Ratio was   13.36%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   13.54%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The Company's ratio of stockholders  equity to total assets was   10.91%   and   11.05%   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company's tangible equity ratio was   8.82%   and   8.81%   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Net Income 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company reported net income of   $13.6 million  , or   $0.19   per basic and diluted share,   up     $0.7 million  , or   5.7%  , from   $12.9 million  , or   $0.18   per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This   increase   in net income is primarily the result of   an increase   in net interest income of   $3.8 million   and   an increase   in non-interest income of   $0.5 million  , offset by   an increase   in the provision for credit losses of   $0.5 million  ,   an increase   in non-interest expense of   $2.1 million  , and   an increase   in provision for income taxes of   $0.9 million  . Refer to    Results of Operations"   below for further discussion. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company reported net income of   $39.1 million  , or   $0.56   per basic and diluted share,   up     $2.6 million  , or   7.2%  , from   $36.5 million  , or   $0.52   per basic share, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This   increase   is the result of   an increase   in net interest income of   $7.5 million   and   an increase   in non-interest income of   $3.1 million  , offset by   an increase   in the provision for credit losses of   $1.2 million  ,   an increase   in non-interest expense of   $4.7 million  ,   an increase   in provision for income taxes of   $1.8 million  , and   an increase   in net income attributed to noncontrolling interest of   $0.3 million  .

The annualized return on average assets was   0.86%   and   0.84%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.89%   and   0.84%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The annualized return on average stockholders  equity was   7.83%   and   7.59%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   7.81%   and   7.43%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Net interest margin was   3.48%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   3.54%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the net interest margin in a highly competitive and declining interest rate environment is, in part, the result of   a decrease   in the yield on interest-earning assets by   six   basis points to   4.10%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   4.16%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and   an increase   of   three   basis points in interest-bearing liabilities to   0.78%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   0.75%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Net interest margin was   3.46%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   3.53%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the net interest margin in a highly competitive and declining interest rate environment is, in part, the result of   a decrease   in the yield on interest-earning assets by   six   basis points to   4.05%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   4.11%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   and   an increase   of   three   basis points in interest-bearing liabilities to   0.78%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   0.75%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  The Company's net interest margin and net interest income continued to be placed under significant pressure due to competitive pricing in all loan categories and the continuation of a low interest-rate environment, along with the Company's diminishing ability to reduce its cost of funds. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The SEC defines  critical accounting policies  as those involving significant judgments and difficult or complex assumptions by management, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain or variable, which have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or net income. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As discussed in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, management has identified the valuation of available-for-sale securities, accounting for assets and liabilities acquired, the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, the review of goodwill and intangibles for impairment, and income tax accounting as the Company s most critical accounting policies.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP 
    
  In addition to evaluating the Company s results of operations in accordance with GAAP, management periodically supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the return on tangible assets or equity, the tangible equity ratio, tangible book value per share, dividend payout ratio and the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses related to originated loans and leases as a percentage of originated loans and leases. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the Company s underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of the Company s capital position.

The following table sets forth the growth (decline) in the Company s loan and lease portfolios during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

The Company s loan portfolio consists primarily of first mortgage loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in the Company s primary lending area, loans to business entities, including commercial lines of credit, loans to condominium associations, and loans and leases used to finance equipment used by small businesses. The Company also provides financing for construction and development projects, home equity and other consumer loans. 
    
  The Company employs seasoned commercial lenders and retail bankers who rely on community and business contacts as well as referrals from customers, attorneys, and other professionals to generate loans and deposits. Existing borrowers are also an important source of business since many of them have more than one loan outstanding with the Company. The Company s  
  
   61 

     Table of Contents  

ability to originate loans depends on the strength of the economy, trends in interest rates, and levels of customer demand, and market competition. 
  The Company's current policy is that the aggregate amount of loans outstanding to any one borrower or related entities may not exceed   $35 million   unless approved by the Board Credit Committee, a committee of the Company's Board of Directors.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   three   borrowers with aggregated loans outstanding of   $35 million   or greater. The total of those loans was   $132 million   or   2.48%   of total loans outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company has written underwriting policies to control the inherent risks in loan origination. The policies address approval limits, loan-to-value ratios, appraisal requirements, debt service coverage ratios, loan concentration limits, and other matters relevant to loan underwriting.  
  Commercial Real Estate Loans 
    
  The commercial real estate portfolio is composed of commercial real estate loans, multi-family mortgage loans, and construction loans and is the largest component of the Company s overall loan portfolio, representing   54.1%   of total loans and leases outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Typically, commercial real estate loans are larger in size and involve a greater degree of risk than owner-occupied residential mortgage loans. Loan repayment is usually dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties and the value of the properties securing the loans. Economic conditions can greatly affect cash flows and property values. 
    
  A number of factors are considered in originating commercial real estate and multi-family mortgage loans. The qualifications and financial condition of the borrower (including credit history), as well as the potential income generation and the value and condition of the underlying property, are evaluated. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, the Company considers the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower s payment history with the Company and other financial institutions. Factors considered in evaluating the underlying property include the net operating income of the mortgaged premises before debt service and depreciation, the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of cash flow before debt service to debt service), the use of conservative capitalization rates, and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value. Generally, personal guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate loan borrowers. 
    
  Commercial real estate and multi-family mortgage loans are typically originated for terms of five years with amortization periods of 5 to 20 years. Many of the loans are priced at inception on a fixed-rate basis generally for periods ranging from two to five years with repricing periods for longer-term loans. When possible, prepayment penalties are included in loan covenants on these loans. For commercial customers who are interested in loans with terms longer than five years, the Company offers interest rate swaps to accommodate customer preferences.  
    
  The Company's urban and suburban market area is characterized by a large number of apartment buildings, condominiums and office buildings. As a result, multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage lending has been a significant part of the Company's activities for many years. These types of loans typically generate higher yields, but also involve greater credit risk. Many of the Company's borrowers have more than one multi-family or commercial real estate loan outstanding with the Company.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the commercial real estate portfolio was composed primarily of loans secured by apartment buildings (  $726.5 million  ), office buildings (  $647.8 million  ), retail stores (  $546.1 million  ), industrial properties (  $298.4 million  ), and mixed-use properties (  $196.9 million  ) at . As of the close of the third quarter, over   97.28%   of the commercial real estate loans outstanding were secured by properties located in New England.  
    
  Construction and development financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate, and thus has higher concentration limits than do other commercial credit classes. Risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of construction costs, the estimated time to sell or rent the completed property at an adequate price or rate of occupancy, and market conditions. If the estimates and projections prove to be inaccurate, the Company may be confronted with a project which, upon completion, has a value that is insufficient to assure full loan repayment. 
    
  Criteria applied in underwriting construction loans for which the primary source of repayment is the sale of the property are different from the criteria applied in underwriting construction loans for which the primary source of repayment is the  
  
   62 

     Table of Contents  

stabilized cash flow from the completed project. For those loans where the primary source of repayment is from resale of the property, in addition to the normal credit analysis performed for other loans, the Company also analyzes project costs, the attractiveness of the property in relation to the market in which it is located, and demand within the market area. For those construction loans where the source of repayment is the stabilized cash flow from the completed project, the Company analyzes not only project costs but also how long it might take to achieve satisfactory occupancy and the reasonableness of projected rental rates in relation to market rental rates. 
    
  Commercial Loans and Leases 
    
  The commercial loan and lease portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, equipment financing loans and leases and condominium association loans and represented   27.6%   of total loans outstanding at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The Company provides commercial banking services to companies in its market area. Approximately   50.7%   of the commercial loans outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were made to borrowers located in New England. The remaining   49.3%   of the commercial loans outstanding were made to borrowers in other areas in the United States of America primarily by the Company's equipment financing divisions with approximately   17.2%   of those balances made to borrowers in New York and New Jersey. Product offerings include lines of credit, term loans, letters of credit, deposit services, and cash management. These types of credit facilities have as their primary source of repayment cash flows from the operations of a business. Interest rates offered are available on a floating basis tied to the prime rate or a similar index or on a fixed-rate basis referenced on the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ( FHLBB ) index. 
    
  Credit extensions are made to established businesses on the basis of loan purpose and assessment of capacity to repay as determined by an analysis of their financial statements, the nature of collateral to secure the credit extension and, in most instances, the personal guarantee of the owner of the business as well as industry and general economic conditions. The Company also participates in U.S. Government programs such as the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) in both the 7A program and as an SBA preferred lender. 
    
  The Company s equipment financing divisions focus on market niches in which its lenders have deep experience and industry contacts, and on making loans to customers with business experience. An important part of the Company s equipment financing loan origination volume comes from equipment manufacturers and existing customers as they expand their operations. The equipment financing portfolio is composed primarily of loans to finance laundry, tow trucks, fitness, dry 
  cleaning, and convenience store equipment. The borrowers are located primarily in the greater New York and New Jersey metropolitan area, although the customer base extends to locations throughout the United States. Typically, the loans are priced at a fixed rate of interest and require monthly payments over a three- to seven-year life. The yields earned on equipment financing loans are higher than those earned on the commercial loans made by the Banks because they involve a higher degree of credit risk. Equipment financing customers are typically small-business owners who operate with limited financial resources and who face greater risks when the economy weakens or unforeseen adverse events arise. Because of these characteristics, personal guarantees of borrowers are usually obtained along with liens on available assets. The size of loan is determined by an analysis of cash flow and other characteristics pertaining to the business and the equipment to be financed, based on detailed revenue and profitability data of similar operations. 
    
  Loans to condominium associations are for the purpose of funding capital improvements, are made for five- to ten-year terms and are secured by a general assignment of condominium association revenues. Among the factors considered in the underwriting of such loans are the level of owner occupancy, the financial condition and history of the condominium association, the attractiveness of the property in relation to the market in which it is located, and the reasonableness of estimates of the cost of capital improvements to be made. Depending on loan size, funds are advanced as capital improvements are made and, in more complex situations, after completion of engineering inspections. 
    
  Consumer Loans 
    
  The consumer loan portfolio is comprised of residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and other consumer loans and represented   18.2%   of total loans outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . The Company focuses its mortgage loans on existing and new customers within its branch networks in the urban and suburban marketplaces in the greater Boston and Providence metropolitan areas. Loans outstanding in the indirect automobile portfolio totaled   $7.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , down from   $13.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . In December 2014, the Company ceased the origination of indirect automobile loans and in March 2015 sold $255.2 million of the indirect automobile loan portfolio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company continues to service the remaining portfolio.

The Company originates adjustable and fixed-rate residential mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residences. Each residential mortgage loan granted is subject to a satisfactorily completed application, employment verification, credit history, and a demonstrated ability to repay the debt. Generally, loans are not made when the loan-to-value ratio exceeds 80% unless private mortgage insurance is obtained and/or there is a financially strong guarantor. Appraisals are performed by outside independent fee appraisers. 
    
  In general, the Company maintains three, five, and seven year adjustable-rate mortgage loans and ten-year fixed-rate fully amortizing mortgage loans in its portfolio. Fixed-rate mortgage loans with maturities beyond ten years, such as 15- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, are generally not maintained in the Company s portfolio but are, rather, sold into the secondary market on a servicing-released basis. At   September 30, 2016  , the Banks acted as correspondent banks in these secondary-market transactions. Loan sales in the secondary market provide funds for additional lending and other banking activities.  
    
  Underwriting guidelines for home equity loans and lines of credit are similar to those for residential mortgage loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit are limited to no more than 80% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan including the amount of any existing first mortgage liens. 
    
  Other consumer loans have historically been a modest part of the Company s loan originations. At   September 30, 2016  , other consumer loans equaled   $12.4 million  , or   0.2%   of total loans outstanding. Consumer equity and debt securities were pledged as collateral for a substantial part of these loans. 

Asset Quality 
    
  Criticized and Classified Assets 
    
  The Company s management rates certain loans and leases as  other asset especially mentioned ("OAEM"),   substandard  or  doubtful  based on criteria established under banking regulations. These loans and leases are collectively referred to as  criticized  assets. Loans and leases rated OAEM have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects of the loan or lease at some future date. Loans and leases rated as substandard are inadequately protected by the payment capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard loans and leases have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if existing deficiencies are not corrected. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $63.7 million   of total assets, including acquired assets, that were designated as criticized. This compares to   $49.0 million   of assets that were designated as criticized at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in criticized assets was primarily due to several criticized taxi medallion loans which were downgraded during the first nine months of   2016  . See Note 5,  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,  to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information on the Company s risk-rating system. 
    
  Nonperforming Assets 
    
   Nonperforming assets  consist of nonperforming loans and leases, other real estate owned ( OREO ) and other repossessed assets. Under certain circumstances, the Company may restructure the terms of a loan or lease as a concession to a borrower, except for acquired loans and leases which are individually evaluated against expected performance on the date of acquisition. These restructured loans and leases are generally considered  nonperforming loans and leases  until a history of collection of at least nine months on the restructured terms of the loan or lease has been established. OREO consists of real estate acquired through foreclosure proceedings and real estate acquired through acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Other repossessed assets consist of assets that have been acquired through foreclosure that are not real estate and are included in other assets on the Company s unaudited consolidated balance sheets.

The following table sets forth information regarding nonperforming assets at the dates indicated:   

Total nonperforming assets, which are composed of nonaccrual loans and leases, OREO and other repossessed assets, increased   $18.0 million   from   $20.7 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $38.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to $19.0 million of taxi medallion loans which were placed on non-accrual and downgraded during the first nine months of 2016. 
    
  Troubled Debt Restructured Loans and Leases 
    
  The following table sets forth information regarding troubled debt restructured loans and leases at the dates indicated: 

Total troubled debt restructuring loans and leases   increase  d by   $9.1 million   to   $32.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $22.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to   $8.8 million   of taxi medallion loans which were restructured under the definition of a troubled debt restructuring, and placed on nonaccrual during the first nine months of 2016.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
    
   The allowance for loan and lease losses consists of general and specific allowances and reflects management s estimate of probable loan and lease losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Management uses a consistent and systematic process and methodology to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis. The allowance is calculated by loan type: commercial real estate loans, commercial loans and leases, indirect automobile loans, and consumer loans, each category of which is further segregated. A formula-based credit evaluation approach is applied to each group that is evaluated collectively, primarily by loss factors, which includes estimates of incurred losses over an estimated loss emergence period, assigned to each risk rating by type, coupled with an analysis of certain loans individually evaluated for impairment. Management continuously evaluates and challenges inputs and assumptions in the allowance for loan and lease loss. 
    
  The process to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses requires management to exercise considerable judgment regarding the risk characteristics of the loan portfolios and the effect of relevant internal and external factors. While management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for loan and lease losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations. Management performs a comprehensive review of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review a financial institution s allowance for loan and lease losses and carrying amounts of other real estate owned. Such agencies may require the financial institution to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.  
    
  During the three months ended September 30 2015, the Company enhanced and refined its general allowance methodology to provide a more precise quantification of probable losses in the portfolio. Under the enhanced methodology, management combined the historical loss information of the Banks to generate a single set of ratios. Management believes it is appropriate to aggregate the ratios as the Banks share common environmental factors, operate in similar markets, and utilize common underwriting standards in accordance with the Company's Credit Policy. In prior periods, a historical loss history applicable to each Bank was used. 
    
  Management employed a similar analysis for the consolidation of the qualitative factors as it did for the quantitative factors. Again, management believes the combination of the existing nine qualitative factors used at each of the Banks into a single group of factors for use across the Company is appropriate based on the commonality of environmental factors, markets, and underwriting standards among the Banks. In prior periods each of the Banks utilized a set of qualitative factors applicable to each Bank. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a portfolio of approximately   $36.0 million   in loans secured by taxi medallions issued by the cities of Boston and Cambridge.  Recently, application-based mobile ride services, such as Uber and Lyft, have generated increased competition in the taxi area, resulting in a reduction in taxi utilization and, as a result, a reduction in the collateral value and credit quality of taxi medallion loans.  This has increased the likelihood that loans secured by taxi medallions may default, or that the borrowers may be unable to repay these loans at maturity, potentially resulting in an increase in troubled debt restructurings. Therefore, beginning with the three months ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company s allowance calculation included a further segmentation of the commercial loans and leases to reflect the increased risk in the Company s taxi medallion portfolio. This allowance calculation segmentation represents management s estimations of the risks associated with the portfolio.

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had an allowance for loan and lease losses associated with taxi medallion loans of   $6.0 million   of which   $4.7 million   were specific reserves and   $1.3 million   was a general reserve. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a general reserve for loan and lease losses associated with taxi medallion loans of   $4.3 million  . The total troubled debt restructured loans and leases secured by taxi medallions increased by   $8.8 million   from $1.3 million at   December 31, 2015   to $10.1 million at   September 30, 2016  . The total loans and leases secured by taxi medallions that were placed on nonaccrual increased to $18.0 million at   September 30, 2016   from zero at   December 31, 2015  . However, further declines in demand for taxi services or further deterioration in the value of taxi medallions may result in higher delinquencies and losses beyond that which is provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses.  
    
  Based on the refinements to the Company s allowance methodology discussed above, management determined that the potential risks anticipated by the unallocated allowance are now incorporated into the allowance methodology, making the unallocated allowance unnecessary. In prior periods, the unallocated allowance was used to recognize the estimated risk associated with the allocated general and specific allowances. It incorporated management s evaluation of existing conditions that were not included in the allocated allowance determinations and provided for losses that arise outside of the ordinary course of business. 
    
   See Note 5,  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,  to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for descriptions of how management determines the balance of the allowance for loan and lease losses for each portfolio and class of loans. 
    
  The following tables present the changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses by portfolio segment for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

The allowance for loan and lease losses was   $58.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  , or   1.10%   of total loans and leases outstanding. This compared to an allowance for loan and lease losses of   $56.7 million   or   1.14%   of total loans and leases outstanding, at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was due to loan growth of   $336.8 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , and the increase in specific reserve for taxi medallion loans, partially offset by the reduction in reserve due to changes in the historical loss factors of the commercial real estate and consumer portfolios.   
    
  Commercial Real Estate Loans 
    
  The allowance for commercial real estate loan losses was   $28.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , or   0.97%   of total commercial real estate loans outstanding. This compared to an allowance for commercial real estate loan losses of   $30.2 million  , or   1.13%   of total commercial real estate loans outstanding, at   December 31, 2015  . Specific reserves on commercial real estate loans were   $0.2 million   and   $2.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The   $2.1 million   decrease in the allowance for commercial real estate loan losses during the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily driven by the decrease in specific reserves due to an impaired commercial real estate loan which was charged off during the second quarter of   2016   and the decrease in reserve due to the changes in loss factors, partially offset by the increase in reserve due to loan growth of   $219.0 million  , or   11.0%   on an annualized basis from   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The ratio of total criticized and classified commercial real estate loans to total commercial real estate loans   decreased   to   0.66%   at   September 30, 2016   from   1.03%   at   December 31, 2015  . The ratio of originated commercial real estate loans on nonaccrual to total originated commercial real estate loans   decreased   to   0.11%   at   September 30, 2016   from   0.13%   at   December 31, 2015  .

Net charge-offs in the commercial real estate loan portfolio for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $0.1 million  . There were no charge-offs or recoveries for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of average commercial real estate loans, annualized net charge-offs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   0.01%  .  
    
  Net charge-offs in the commercial real estate loan portfolio for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   $1.5 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively. The increase in net charge-offs was due to the charge-off of $1.0 million for a commercial real estate loan during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . As a percentage of average commercial real estate loans, annualized net charge-offs for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   0.07%   and   0.03%  , respectively.  
    
  Commercial Loans and Leases 
    
  The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses was   $26.5 million  , or   1.8%   of total commercial loans and leases outstanding, at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $22.0 million  , or   1.60%  , at   December 31, 2015  .  Specific reserves on commercial loans and leases increased from   $1.3 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $6.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The   $4.5 million     increase   in the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses during the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily driven by loan growth of   $96.6 million  , or   9.4%   on an annualized basis, from   December 31, 2015  , and the increase in specific reserve for impaired taxi medallion loans, partially offset by the decrease in reserve due to risk rating migration. 
    
  The ratio of total criticized and classified commercial loans and leases to total commercial loans and leases was   3.03%   at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   1.57%   at   December 31, 2015  . The ratio of originated commercial loans and leases on nonaccrual to total originated commercial loans and leases   increased   to   1.97%   at   September 30, 2016   from   0.46%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Net charge-offs in the commercial loan and lease portfolio for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   $0.4 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively. As a percentage of average commercial loans and leases, the annualized net charge-offs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   0.10%   and   0.39%  , respectively.  
    
  Net charge-offs in the commercial loan and lease portfolio for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   $2.8 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily due to the charge-off of $1.8 million for a commercial relationship during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   which was recorded in the second quarter of 2016. As a percentage of average commercial loans and leases, annualized net charge-offs for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   0.26%   and   0.18%  , respectively.  
    
  Indirect Automobile Loans 
    
  The allowance for indirect automobile loan losses was   $0.2 million  , or   1.97%   of total indirect automobile loans outstanding, at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0.3 million  , or   1.97%   of the indirect automobile portfolio outstanding, at   December 31, 2015  . Loans outstanding decreased   $6.1 million   from   $13.7 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $7.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  . There were   no   loans individually evaluated for impairment in the indirect automobile portfolio at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The ratio of indirect automobile loans with borrower credit scores below 660 to the total indirect automobile portfolio decreased to   44.6%   at   September 30, 2016   from   45.5%   at   December 31, 2015  . The ratio of indirect automobile loans on nonaccrual to total indirect automobile loans   decreased   to   2.35%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   4.93%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Net charge-offs in the indirect automobile portfolio for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   $7.0 thousand   and   $117.0 thousand  , respectively. As a percentage of average indirect automobile loans, the annualized net recoveries for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   0.33%   and   2.62%  , respectively. 
    
  Net charge-offs in the indirect automobile portfolio for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $5.0 thousand  . This compared to net charge-offs of   $0.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of average indirect automobile loans, the annualized net recoveries for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   0.06%  .

Consumer Loans 
    
  The allowance for consumer loan losses, including residential loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, was   $4.2 million  , or   0.44%   of total consumer loans and leases outstanding, at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $4.3 million  , or   0.46%  , at   December 31, 2015  . Specific reserves on consumer loans were   $127.0 thousand   and   $9.0 thousand   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The ratio of originated consumer loans on nonaccrual to total originated consumer loans   decreased   to   0.22%   at   September 30, 2016   from   0.29%   at   December 31, 2015  .  The risk of loss on a home equity loan is higher since the property securing the loan has often been previously pledged as collateral for a first mortgage loan. The Company gathers and analyzes delinquency data, to the extent that data are available on these first liens, for purposes of assessing the collectability of the second liens held for the Company even if these home equity loans are not delinquent. The data are further analyzed for performance differences between amortizing and non-amortizing home equity loans, the percentage borrowed to total loan commitment, and by the amount of payments made by the borrower. The loss exposure is not considered to be high due to the combination of current property values, the historically low loan-to-value ratios, the low level of losses experienced in the past few years, and the low level of loan delinquencies at   September 30, 2016  . If the local economy weakens, a rise in losses in those loan classes could occur. Historically, losses in these classes have been low. 
    
  Net charge-offs in the consumer loan portfolio for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively. As a percentage of average consumer loans, the annualized net charge-offs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   0.04%   and   0.09%  , respectively.  
    
  Net charge-offs in the consumer loan portfolio for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   $0.6 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively. As a percentage of average consumer loans, the annualized net charge-offs for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were   0.09%   and   0.06%  , respectively.  
    
  The following table sets forth the Company s percent of allowance for loan and lease losses to the total allowance for loan and lease losses and the percent of loans to total loans for each of the categories listed at the dates indicated. 

Investments 
    
  The investment portfolio exists primarily for liquidity purposes, and secondarily as sources of interest and dividend income, interest-rate risk management and tax planning as a counterbalance to loan and deposit flows. Investment securities are

     Table of Contents  

utilized as part of the Company s asset/liability management and may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, factors such as changes in market conditions and interest rates, security prepayment rates, deposit outflows, liquidity concentrations, and regulatory capital requirements. 
    
  The investment policy of the Company, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis, specifies the types of investments that are acceptable, required investment ratings by at least one nationally recognized rating agency, concentration limits and duration guidelines. Compliance with the investment policy is monitored on a regular basis. In general, the Company seeks to maintain a high degree of liquidity and targets cash, cash equivalents and investment securities available-for-sale balances between 10% and 30% of total assets. 
    
  Cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities   decreased   approximately   $16.5 million  , or   9.7%   on an annualized basis, to   $665.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $682.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in cash balances, as excess balances were utilized to help fund loan growth. Cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities were   10%   of total assets at   September 30, 2016   and   11.3%   of total assets at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The following table sets forth certain information regarding the amortized cost and market value of the Company s investment securities at the dates indicated: 

The fair value of investment securities is based principally on market prices and dealer quotes received from third-party, nationally-recognized pricing services for identical investment securities such as U.S. Treasury and agency securities. The Company's marketable equity securities are priced this way and are included in Level 1. These prices are validated by comparing the primary pricing source with an alternative pricing source when available. When quoted market prices for identical securities are unavailable, the Company uses market prices provided by independent pricing services based on recent trading activity and other observable information, including but not limited to market interest-rate curves, referenced credit spreads, and estimated prepayment speeds, where applicable. These investments include certain U.S. and government agency debt securities, GSE residential MBSs and CMOs, corporate debt securities, SBA commercial loan asset-backed securities, and trust preferred securities, all of which are included in Level 2.  
    
  Additionally, management reviews changes in fair value from period to period and performs testing to ensure that prices received from the third parties are consistent with their expectation of the market. Changes in the prices obtained from the pricing service are analyzed from month to month, taking into consideration changes in market conditions including changes in

  Maturities, calls, and principal repayments for investment securities available-for-sale totaled   $76.2 million   and   $77.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company purchased   $77.3 million   of investment securities available-for-sale. This compared to   $50.5 million   in purchases of investment securities available-for-sale for the same period in   2015  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company did not sell any investment securities available-for-sale. 
    
  Maturities, calls, and principal repayments for investment securities held-to-maturity totaled   $41.3 million   and   $5.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company purchased   $25.0 million   of investment securities held-to-maturity. This compared to   $68.5 million   in purchases of investment securities held-to-maturity for the same period in   2015  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company did not sell any investment securities held-to-maturity.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of all investment securities available-for-sale was   $524.3 million  , with net unrealized gains of   $7.1 million  , compared to a fair value of   $513.2 million   and net unrealized losses of   $4.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   $78.1 million  , or   14.9%   of the portfolio, had gross unrealized losses of   $0.7 million  . This compares to   $368.1 million  , or   71.7%   of the portfolio, with gross unrealized losses of   $6.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of all investment securities held-to-maturity was   $78.1 million   with an amortized cost of   $77.1 million   and net unrealized gains of   $1.0 million  , compared to a fair value of   $93.7 million  , which approximated cost, at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  ,   $19.1 million  , or   24.5%   of the portfolio, had gross unrealized losses of   $52.0 thousand  . This compares to   $52.3 million  , or   55.8%   of the portfolio, with gross unrealized losses of   $0.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Management believes that these negative differences between amortized cost and fair value do not include credit losses, but rather differences in interest rates between the time of purchase and the time of measurement. It is more likely than not that the Company will not sell the investment securities before recovery, and, as a result, it will recover the amortized cost basis of the investment securities. As such, management has determined that these investment securities are not other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . If market conditions for investment securities worsen or the creditworthiness of the underlying issuers deteriorates, it is possible that the Company may recognize additional other-than-temporary impairments in future periods.

Total deposits   increased     $258.9 million  , or   8.0%   on an annualized basis, to   $4.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $4.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . As a percentage of total assets, deposits   increased   from   71.3%   at   December 31, 2015   to   71.5%   at   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to change in balance sheet mix. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $247.6 million   of brokered deposits compared to   $252.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Brokered deposits allow the Company to seek additional funding by attracting deposits from outside the Company's core market. The Company's investment policy limits the amount of brokered deposits to 15% of total assets. Brokered deposits are included in the certificate of deposit balance, which   increased     $18.2 million  , or   2.2%   on an annualized basis, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Certificates of deposit   decreased   as a percentage of total deposits to   24.2%   at   September 30, 2016   from   25.3%   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , core deposits   increased     $240.7 million  , or   10.0%   on an annualized basis. As a percentage of total deposits, the ratio   increased   from   74.7%   at   December 31, 2015   to   75.8%   at   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the shift in deposit mix.

Advances from the FHLBB 
    
  On a long-term basis, the Company intends to continue to increase its core deposits. The Company also uses FHLBB borrowings and other wholesale borrowing opportunistically as part of the Company s overall strategy to fund loan growth and manage interest-rate risk and liquidity. The advances are secured by blanket security agreements which require the Banks to maintain as collateral certain qualifying assets, principally mortgage loans and securities in an aggregate amount at least equal to outstanding advances. The maximum amount that the FHLBB will advance to member institutions, including the Company, fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the FHLBB. The Company may also borrow from the FRB  discount window  as necessary.

     Table of Contents  

FHLBB borrowings   increased     $39.1 million   to   $901.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $861.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in FHLBB borrowings was primarily due to additional advances to fund loan and lease growth. The Company also benefited from $14.1 million of borrowings at 0% interest for three years from a program offered by the FHLBB to Boston member banks who invest in small business loans to customers that create or preserve jobs in New England in the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  Repurchase Agreements 
    
  The Company periodically enters into repurchase agreements with its larger deposit and commercial customers as part of its cash management services which are typically overnight borrowings. Short-term borrowings and repurchase agreements with commercial customers   increased     $0.4 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $38.2 million   as of   December 31, 2015   to   $38.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , as customers shifted funds from other deposit products. 
    
  Subordinated Debentures and Notes 
    
  The Company has $75.0 million of 6.0% fixed-to-floating subordinated notes due September 15, 2029. The Company is obligated to pay 6.0% interest semiannually between September 2014 and September 2024. Subsequently, the Company is obligated to pay 3-month LIBOR plus 3.315% quarterly until the notes mature in September 2029.  
    
  The following table summarizes the Company's subordinated debentures and notes at the dates indicated.  

The above carrying amounts of the subordinated debentures included   $636.8 thousand   of accretion adjustments and   $1.3 million   of capitalized debt issuance costs as of   September 30, 2016  . This compares to   $688.4 thousand   of accretion adjustments and   $1.4 million   of capitalized debt issuance costs as of   December 31, 2015  .

Stockholders  Equity and Dividends 
    
  The Company s total stockholders  equity was   $696.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , a   $28.9 million     increase   compared to   $667.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase primarily reflects net income attributable to the Company of   $39.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale of   $7.4 million   (after-tax), an increase of   $1.0 million   related to stock-based compensation, offset by common stock dividends of   $19.0 million   paid in that same period. 
    
  Stockholders  equity represented   10.91%   of total assets at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   11.05%   at   December 31, 2015  . Tangible stockholders  equity (total stockholders  equity less goodwill and identified intangible assets, net) represented   8.82%   of tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and identified intangible assets, net) at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   8.81%   at   December 31, 2015  .

Results of Operations   Comparison of the Three and   Nine  -Month Periods Ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015    
    
  The primary drivers of the Company s operating income are net interest income, which is strongly affected by the net yield on interest-earning assets and liabilities ( net interest margin ), the quality of the Company s assets, its levels of non-interest income and non-interest expense, and its tax provision. 
    
  The Company s net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on its investments, loans and leases, and its cost of funds. Interest income depends on the amount of interest-earning assets outstanding during the period and the yield earned thereon. Cost of funds is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The increases (decreases) in the components of interest income and interest expense, expressed in terms of fluctuation in average volume and rate, are summarized under    Rate/Volume Analysis    below. Information as to the components of interest income, interest expense and average rates is provided under    Average Balances, Net Interest Income, Interest-Rate Spread and Net Interest Margin    below. 
    
  Because the Company s assets and liabilities are not identical in duration and in repricing dates, the differential between asset and liability repricing and duration is vulnerable to changes in market interest rates as well as the overall shape of the yield curve. These vulnerabilities are inherent to the business of banking and are commonly referred to as  interest-rate risk.  How interest-rate risk is measured and, once measured, how much interest-rate risk is taken is based on numerous assumptions and other subjective judgments. See the discussion in    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    below. 
    
  The quality of the Company s assets also influences its earnings. Loans and leases that are not paid on a timely basis and exhibit other weaknesses can result in the loss of principal and/or interest income. Additionally, the Company must make timely provisions to the allowance for loan and lease losses based on estimates of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. These additions, which are charged against earnings, are necessarily greater when greater probable losses are expected. Further, the Company incurs expenses as a result of resolving troubled assets. These variables reflect the  credit risk  that the Company takes on in the ordinary course of business and are further discussed under    Financial Condition   Asset Quality    above. 

Net Interest Income 
    
  Net interest income of   $52.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $3.8 million  , or   7.7%  , as compared to the three months ended September 30,   2015  . This overall   increase   was the result of   an increase   in total interest income of   $4.8 million  , or   8.5%  , to   $61.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , offset by   an increase   in interest expense of   $1.1 million  , or   13.3%  , to   $9.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Net interest income of   $151.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increased   approximately   $7.5 million  , or   5.2%  , as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This overall   increase   was the result of   an increase   in total interest income of   $10.2 million  , or   6.1%  , to   $178.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $168.5 million   at   September 30, 2015  , offset by   an increase   in interest expense of   $2.7 million  , or   11.1%  , to   $26.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $24.2 million   at   September 30, 2015  . Refer to    Results of Operations - Comparison of the Three-Month and Nine-Month Periods Ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015     Interest Income    and    Results of Operations - Comparison of the Three-Month and Nine-Month Periods Ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015     Interest Expense Deposit and Borrowed Funds    below for more details. 
    
  Net interest margin   decreased   to   3.48%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   3.54%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the net interest margin   decreased   to   3.46%   from   3.53%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the net interest margin is the result of repricing interest-earning assets in a lower interest rate environment without a comparable offset in lower funding costs.  
    
  The yield on interest-earning assets   decreased   to   4.10%   in the three months ended September 30,   2016   from   4.16  % during the three months ended September 30,   2015  . The   decrease   is the result of the continued pricing pressure due to the low interest rate environment and the competition in most loan categories as well as decreases in income from restricted equity securities and interest payments on debt securities during the three months ended September 30, 2016. In the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company benefited from a   $0.9 million   accretion on acquired loans and leases, which contributed   six   basis points to yields on interest-earning assets, compared to   $0.8 million  , or   six   basis points, in the three months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, the Company recorded   $1.2 million   in prepayment penalties, which contributed   eight   basis points to yields on interest-earning assets, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to   $0.9 million  , or   seven   basis points, in the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
  The yield on interest-earning assets   decreased   to   4.05%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   4.11%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   is the result of the continued pricing pressure due to the low interest rate environment and the competition in most loan categories, as well as a decrease in accretion on acquired loans and leases, offset by an increase in prepayment penalties and late charges, and the increase in income from restricted equity securities, debt securities, and other short term investments. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company benefited from a   $1.3 million   accretion on acquired loans and leases, which contributed   three   basis points to yields on interest-earning assets, compared to   $2.8 million  , or   seven   basis points, in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease was due to the continued paydowns of acquired loans and the recognition of the associated purchase accounting accretion. In addition, the Company recorded   $2.7 million   in prepayment penalties, which contributed   six   basis points to yields on interest-earning assets, in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , compared to   $2.4 million  , or   six   basis points, in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  The overall cost of funds (including non-interest-bearing demand checking accounts)   increased     two   basis points to   0.65%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   0.63%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The overall cost of funds   increased     two   basis points to   0.65%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   0.63%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Refer to   "Financial Condition - Borrowed Funds"   above for more details. 
     
  Future net interest income, net interest spread and net interest margin may continue to be negatively affected by the low interest-rate environment; ongoing pricing pressures in both loan and deposit portfolios; and the ability of the Company to increase its core deposit ratio, increase its non-interest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits, decrease its loan-to-deposit ratio, or decrease its reliance on FHLBB advances. They may also be negatively affected by changes in the amount of accretion on acquired loans and leases, deposits, and borrowed funds included in interest income and interest expense.

Interest Income 

Loans and Leases 

Interest income from loans and leases was   $57.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , resulting in a yield on total loans and leases of   4.36%  . This compares to   $52.7 million   of interest on loans and leases and a yield of   4.43%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The year-over-year   increase   of   $5.1 million   in interest income from loans and leases was due to an   increase   of   $6.1 million   due to   increase   in origination volume, offset by a   decrease   of   $1.0 million   due to changes in rate. Accretion on acquired loans and leases of   $0.9 million   contributed   six   basis points to net interest margin during the three months ended September 30,   2016  , compared to   $0.8 million   and   six   basis points in the three months ended September 30,   2015  .  
    
  Interest income from loans and leases was $  167.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , resulting in a yield on total loans and leases of   4.32%  . This compares to $  157.8 million   of interest on loans and leases and a yield of   4.42%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The year-over-year   increase   of $  9.7 million   in interest income from loans and leases was due to an   increase   of $  14.5 million   in   increase  d origination volume, offset by a   decrease   of   $4.7 million   for changes in rate. Accretion on acquired loans and leases of $  1.3 million   contributed   three   basis points to the net interest margin for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to $  2.8 million   and   seven   basis points for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was primarily due to the continued paydowns of acquired loans and the recognition of related purchase accounting accretion. 

Investments 

Total investment income was   $3.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $4.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The yield on investments   decreased   to   2.14%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   2.30%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   $0.3 million   year-over-year   decrease   in quarterly interest income on investments was primarily driven by lower rates.  
    
  Total investment income was   $11.2 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $10.7 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The yield on investments   increase   to   2.13%   for the nine months ended

Interest Expense - Deposits and Borrowed Funds 

Deposits 
    
  Interest expense on deposits   increased   by   $0.8 million  , or   18.2%  , to   $5.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $4.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The cost of total interest-bearing deposits   increased   to   0.56%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.51%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in interest expense on deposits was driven by a   $0.4 million     increase   in deposit volume and a   $0.4 million     increase   due to deposit rate. Accretion on acquired deposits was   $24.0 thousand   and   $43.0 thousand   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Accretion did not have an impact on the Company's net interest margin for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Interest expense on deposits   increased   by   $1.9 million  , or   15.1%  , to   $14.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $12.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The cost of total interest-bearing deposits increased to   0.55%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.51%   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in interest expense on deposits was due to a   $0.9 million     increase   in volume and a   $1.1 million     increase   due to deposit rate. Accretion on acquired deposits was   $73.0 thousand   and   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Accretion did not have an impact on the Company's net interest margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Borrowed Funds 
    
  Interest expense on borrowed funds   increased   by   $0.3 million  , or   7.8%  , to   $4.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $3.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The cost of borrowed funds   decreased   to   1.52%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   1.61%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in interest expense was attributable to a   $0.4 million     increase   as a result of higher volume and a   $81.0 thousand     decrease   due to lower borrowing rates. Accretion on acquired borrowed funds of   $0.6 million   improved the Company s net

interest margin by   four   basis points for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This compared to   $0.7 million   and   five   basis points for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Interest expense on borrowed funds   increased   by   $0.7 million  , or   6.5%  , to   $12.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $11.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The cost of borrowed funds was unchanged at   1.55%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   1.55%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in interest expense was driven by higher volumes. Accretion on acquired borrowed funds of   $1.9 million   improved the Company s net interest margin by   four   basis points for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . This compared to   $2.1 million   and   five   basis points for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 

Provision for Credit Losses 
    
  The provision for credit losses are set forth below: 

The provision for credit losses   increased     $0.4 million  , or   26.2%  , to   $2.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $1.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in total provision was primarily driven by continued loan growth in the commercial real estate and commercial portfolios and the increase in specific reserves for the taxi medallion portfolio due to changes in the collateral values, offset by the decrease in provision to cover the net charge-off activity for the period. 
    
  The provision for credit losses   increased     $1.2 million  , or   20.4%  , to   $7.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $5.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in total provision was primarily driven by continued loan growth in the commercial real estate and commercial portfolios and the increase in provision for the taxi medallion portfolio, offset by the decrease in provision due to risk rating migration and loss factor changes, the elimination of the unallocated reserve in 2015 and the decrease in provision for indirect automobile portfolio as a result of the sale of the majority of the indirect automobile portfolio in the first quarter of 2015. 
    
  See management s discussion of    Financial Condition   Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses    and Note 5,  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,  to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for a description of how management determined the allowance for loan and lease losses for each portfolio and class of loans.

Non-Interest Income 
    
  The following table sets forth the components of non-interest income for the periods indicated: 

Total non-interest income   increased     $0.5 million  , or   11.4%  , to   $5.3 million   for three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $4.8 million   for the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to an   increase   of $  0.1 million   in loan fees, an   increase   of $  0.1 million   in gain on sales of loans and leases held-for-sale, and an   increase   of $  0.3 million   in other income. 
    
  Total non-interest income   increased     $3.1 million  , or   21.8%   to   $17.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $14.1 million   for the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was primarily driven by an   increase   of   $1.9 million   in loan level derivative income, an   increase   of $  0.4 million   in gains on sales of loans and leases held-for-sale, and an   increase   of   $0.5 million   in other income.  
    
  The   increase   in loan level derivative income in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is driven by the new loan level interest rate swap agreements completed in the period.

Non-interest expense   increased     $2.1 million  , or   6.8%  , to   $33.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $31.3 million   for the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to an   increase   of   $2.5 million   in compensation and employee benefits expense, and an   increase   of   $0.2 million   in equipment and data processing expense, partially offset by a   decrease   of $  0.4 million   in other expense. 
    
  Non-interest expense   increased     $4.7 million  , or   5.0%  , to   $97.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $93.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . The   increase   was primarily due to an   increase   of   $5.7 million   in compensation and employee benefits expense, offset by a   decrease   of   $0.3 million   in professional services and a   decrease   of   $0.6 million   in other expense. 
    
  The efficiency ratio   decreased   to   57.89%   for   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   58.59%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and decreased to   57.82%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   58.74%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Efforts to drive revenue growth contributed to the improvement in the efficiency ratio in   2016  . 
    
  Compensation and employee benefits expense   increased     $2.5 million  , or   14.0%  , to   $20.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $17.9 million   for the same period in   2015   and   increased     $5.7 million  , or   10.9%  , to   $58.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $52.5 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily driven by costs associated with a management change,   increase  s in employee headcount and incentive plans, and an increase in Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan expense due to a decrease in the discount rate. 
    
  Equipment and data processing expense   increased     $0.2 million  , or   6.3%  , to   $3.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $3.6 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily driven by an   increase   related to software licenses and consulting for a data storage software program. 
    
  Professional services expense   decreased     $0.3 million  , or   9.8%   to   $2.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to lower audit and compliance fees incurred in   2016  . 
    
  Other expense   decreased   $  0.4 million  , or   13.9%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from $  2.7 million   for the same period in 2015 and   decreased     $0.6 million   or   7.3%  , to   $7.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $8.3 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily driven by a reduction in loan collection expense and a gain on the sale of a foreclosed property in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  

Provision for Income Taxes 

The Company recorded income tax expense of   $7.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , representing effective tax rates of   35.4%   and   33.9%  , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to the adoption of ASU 2014-01,   Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects,   reflected in the 2015 effective tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 
    
  Liquidity is defined as the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. The Company further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers, as well as to earnings enhancement opportunities, in a changing marketplace. Liquidity management is monitored by an Asset/Liability Committee ( ALCO ), consisting of members of management, which is responsible for establishing and monitoring liquidity targets as well as strategies and tactics to meet these targets. 
    
  The primary source of funds for the payment of dividends and expenses by the Company is dividends paid to it by its Banks and Brookline Securities Corp. The primary sources of liquidity for the Banks consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, borrowed funds and maturing investment securities. 
    
  Deposits, which are considered the most stable source of liquidity, totaled   $4.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and represented   81.7%   of total funding (the sum of total deposits and total borrowings), compared to deposits of   $4.3 billion  , or   81.4%   of total funding, at   December 31, 2015  . Core deposits, which consist of demand checking, NOW, savings and money market accounts, totaled   $3.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and represented   75.8%   of total deposits, compared to core deposits of   $3.2 billion  , or   74.7%   of total deposits, at   December 31, 2015  . Additionally, the Company maintained   $247.6 million   of brokered deposits at   September 30, 2016  , which represented   5.4%   of total deposits compared to   $252.3 million   or   5.9%   of total deposits at   December 31, 2015  . The Company offers attractive interest rates based on market conditions to increase deposits balances, while managing cost of funds.  
    
  Borrowings are used to diversify the Company s funding mix and to support asset growth. When profitable lending and investment opportunities exist, access to borrowings provides a means to fund the balance sheet. Borrowings totaled   $1.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , representing   18.3%   of total funding, compared to   $983.0 million  , or   18.6%   of total funding, at   December 31, 2015  .  
  As members of the FHLBB, the Banks have access to both short- and long-term borrowings. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's total borrowing limit from the FHLBB for advances and repurchase agreements was   $1.4 billion   as compared to   $1.3 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  , based on the level of qualifying collateral available for these borrowings. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Banks also had access to funding through certain uncommitted lines of credit of   $119.0 million  . The Company had a   $12.0 million   committed line of credit for contingent liquidity as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  The Company has access to the Federal Reserve Bank "discount window" to supplement its liquidity. The Company had $75.6 million of borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have any outstanding borrowings with the Federal Reserve Bank. 
  Additionally, the Banks have access to liquidity through repurchase agreements and brokered deposits.  
  In general, the Company seeks to maintain a high degree of liquidity and targets cash, cash equivalents and investment securities available-for-sale with balances between   10%   and   30%   of total assets. At   September 30, 2016  , cash, cash equivalents and investment securities available-for-sale totaled   $588.8 million  , or   9%   of total assets. This compares to   $588.7 million  , or   10%   of total assets, at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  While management believes that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its commitments and to fund the Banks  lending and investment activities, the availability of these funding sources is subject to broad economic conditions and could be restricted in the future. Such restrictions would impact the Company s immediate liquidity and/or additional liquidity needs. 

Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments 
    
  The Company is party to off-balance-sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include loan commitments, standby and commercial letters of credit and interest-rate swaps. According to GAAP, these financial instruments are not recorded in the financial statements until they are funded or related fees are incurred or received. 
    
  The contract amounts reflect the extent of the involvement the Company has in particular classes of these instruments. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparty

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Market Risk 
    
  Market risk is the risk that the market value or estimated fair value of the Company s assets, liabilities and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility, or that the Company s net income will be significantly reduced by interest-rate changes. 
    
  Interest-Rate Risk 
    
  The principal market risk facing the Company is interest-rate risk, which can come in a variety of forms, including repricing risk, yield-curve risk, basis risk, and prepayment risk. Repricing risk exists when the change in the average yield of either interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities is more sensitive than the other to changes in market interest rates. Such a change in sensitivity could reflect a number of possible mismatches in the repricing opportunities of the Company s assets and liabilities. Yield-curve risk reflects the possibility that the changes in the shape of the yield curve could have different effects on the Company s assets and liabilities. Basis risk exists when different parts of the balance sheet are subject to varying base rates reflecting the possibility that the spread from those base rates will deviate. Prepayment risk is associated with financial instruments with an option to prepay before the stated maturity, often a disadvantage to the person selling the option; this risk is most often associated with the prepayment of loans, callable investments and callable borrowings. 
    
  Asset/Liability Management 
    
  Market risk and interest-rate risk management are governed by the Company s Asset/Liability Committee ( ALCO ). The ALCO establishes exposure limits that define the Company s tolerance for interest-rate risk. The ALCO and the Company's Treasury Group measure and manage the composition of the balance sheet over a range of possible changes in interest rates while remaining responsive to market demand for loan and deposit products. The ALCO monitors current exposures versus limits and reports those results to the Board of Directors. The policy limits and guidelines serve as benchmarks for measuring interest-rate risk and for providing a framework for evaluation and interest-rate risk-management decision-making. The Company measures its interest-rate risk by using an asset/liability simulation model. The model considers several factors to determine the Company s potential exposure to interest-rate risk, including measurement of repricing gaps, duration, convexity, value-at-risk, market value of portfolio equity under assumed changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of yield curves, and general market volatility. 
    
  Management controls the Company s interest-rate exposure using several strategies, which include adjusting the maturities of securities in the Company s investment portfolio, limiting or expanding the terms of loans originated, limiting fixed-rate deposits with terms of more than five years, and adjusting maturities of FHLBB advances. The Company limits this risk by restricting the types of MBSs it invests in to those with limited average life changes under certain interest-rate-shock scenarios, or securities with embedded prepayment penalties. The Company also places limits on holdings of fixed-rate mortgage loans with maturities greater than five years. The Company also may use derivative instruments, principally interest-rate swaps, to manage its interest-rate risk; however, the Company had no derivative fair value hedges or derivative cash flows at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . See Note 10,  Derivatives and Hedging Activities,  to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Measuring Interest-Rate Risk 
    
  As noted above, interest-rate risk can be measured by analyzing the extent to which the repricing of assets and liabilities are mismatched to create an interest-rate sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest-rate sensitive within a specific period if it will mature or reprice within that period. The interest-rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest-rate-sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest-rate-sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest-rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest-rate-sensitive assets. During a period of falling interest rates, therefore, a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income. Conversely, during a period of rising interest rates, a positive gap position would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. 
    
  The Company's interest-rate risk position is measured using both income simulation and interest-rate sensitivity "gap" analysis. Income simulation is the primary tool for measuring the interest-rate risk inherent in the Company s balance sheet at a given point in time by showing the effect on net interest income, over a twelve-month period, of a variety of interest-rate shocks. These simulations take into account repricing, maturity, and prepayment characteristics of individual products. The    
  
   90 

     Table of Contents  

ALCO reviews simulation results to determine whether the exposure resulting from changes in market interest rates remains within established tolerance levels over a twelve-month horizon, and develops appropriate strategies to manage this exposure. The Company s interest-rate risk analysis remains modestly asset-sensitive at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , net interest income simulation indicated that the Company s exposure to changing interest rates was within policy limits. The ALCO reviews the methodology utilized for calculating interest-rate risk exposure and may periodically adopt modifications to this methodology. The following table presents the estimated impact of interest-rate changes on the Company s estimated net interest income over the twelve-month periods indicated: 

The estimated impact of a 300 basis points increase in market interest rates on the Company's estimated net interest income over a twelve-month horizon was a positive   3.1%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to a positive   5.9%   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease in asset sensitivity was primarily due to incremental balance sheet growth funded with short term wholesale funding.  
    
  The Company also uses interest-rate sensitivity  gap  analysis to provide a more general overview of its interest-rate risk profile. The interest-rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing 
  liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s one-year cumulative gap was a   negative     $343.1 million  , or   5.8%   of total interest-earning assets, compared with a   negative     $214.1 million  , or   3.8%   of total interest-earning assets, at   December 31, 2015  . 
     
  The assumptions used in the Company's interest-rate sensitivity simulation discussed above are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the simulations cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates. For additional discussion on interest-rate risk see Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  of the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Economic Value of Equity ("EVE") at Risk Simulation is conducted in tandem with net interest income simulations, to ascertain a longer term view of the Company s interest-rate risk position by capturing longer-term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. It measures the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to changes in interest rates. The EVE at Risk Simulation values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate growth assumptions. As with the net interest income simulation, this simulation captures product characteristics such as loan resets, repricing terms, maturity dates, and rate caps and floors. Key assumptions include loan prepayment speeds, deposit pricing elasticity and non-maturity deposit attrition rates. These assumptions can have significant impacts on valuation results as the assumptions remain in effect for the entire life of each asset and liability. The Company conducts non-maturity deposit behavior studies on a periodic basis to support deposit assumptions used in the valuation process. All key assumptions are subject to a periodic review. 
    
  EVE at Risk Simulation is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current interest rates as well as parallel shocks to the current interest-rate environment. The following table sets forth the estimated percentage change in the Company s EVE at Risk Simulation, assuming various shifts in interest rates. Given the interest rate environment at   September 30, 2016  , simulations for interest rate declines of more than 100 basis points were not deemed to be meaningful.

  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer considered that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the quarterly evaluation that occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter that has materially and detrimentally affected, or is reasonably likely to materially and detrimentally affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 
    
  The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a -15(f). The Company s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to its management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
    
  Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of   December 31, 2015   and the related Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm thereon appear on pages F-1 and F-2 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .
