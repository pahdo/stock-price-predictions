NAUTILUS, INC.  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

(1) GENERAL INFORMATION 
    
  Basis of Consolidation and Presentation 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Nautilus, Inc. and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have not been audited. We have condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). Management believes the disclosures contained herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. However, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Form 10-K ). 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Further information regarding significant estimates can be found in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and our results of operations and comprehensive income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. Our revenues typically vary seasonally and this seasonality can have a significant effect on operating results, inventory levels and working capital needs. 
    
  Unless indicated otherwise, all information regarding our operating results pertain to our continuing operations. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  ASU 2016-15 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15,  "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are intended to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, with the intent of reducing diversity in practice for the eight (8) types of cash flows identified. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public companies' fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. Entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented, but may apply it prospectively if retrospective application would be impracticable. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  ASU 2016-13 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." The amendments in ASU 2016-13 replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for public companies' annual periods, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, using a modified-retrospective approach, with certain exceptions. Early adoption is permitted. While we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-13 to have a material effect on our business, we are evaluating any potential impact that adoption of ASU 2016-13 may have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  ASU 2016-12 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients." ASU 2016-12 clarifies aspects of Topic 606 related to assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, non-cash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition, while retaining the related core  
  
   5 

principles for those areas. The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-12 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09). While we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-12 to have a material effect on our business, we are evaluating any potential impact that adoption of ASU 2016-12 may have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  ASU 2016-10 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing." ASU 2016-10 clarifies aspects of Topic 606 related to identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related core principles for those areas. The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-10 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09). While we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-10 to have a material effect on our business, we are evaluating any potential impact that adoption of ASU 2016-10 may have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
       
  ASU 2016-09 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public companies' annual periods, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted subject to certain requirements, and the method of application (i.e., retrospective, modified retrospective or prospective) depends on the transaction area that is being amended. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-09 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  ASU 2016-02 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  "Leases (Topic 842)." ASU 2016-02 replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 840, Leases. The new standards will require companies and other organizations to include lease obligations on their balance sheets, including a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset, and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies' annual periods, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating any potential impact that adoption of ASU 2016-02 may have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  ASU 2015-17 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes." ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes, and requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position, and aligns the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") IAS 1. ASU 2015-17 is effective for public companies' financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early application is permitted and may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Our early adoption of ASU 2015-17 in January 2016 did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are applying ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis to all deferred tax liabilities and assets, and prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted. 
    
  ASU 2015-16 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments." ASU 2015-16 simplifies the presentation of provisional amounts reported for items in a business combination for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized. The amendments in ASU 2015-16 require an entity to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, and to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for public companies' financial statements issued for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 on a prospective basis. Our adoption of ASU 2015-16 as of January 2016 did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

6 

ASU 2015-11 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330).  ASU 2015-11 simplifies the accounting for the valuation of all inventory not accounted for using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method by prescribing inventory be valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for public companies' annual periods, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  ASU 2015-05 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40).  ASU 2015-05 provides guidance regarding the accounting for a customer's fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement, specifically about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, and if so, how to account for the software license. ASU 2015-05 was effective for public companies' annual periods, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Our adoption of ASU 2015-05 in January 2016 did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  ASU 2014-12 
  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)." ASU No. 2014-12 addresses accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. ASU 2014-12 indicates that, in such situations, the performance target should be treated as a performance condition and, accordingly, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Instead, compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved. ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Our adoption of ASU 2014-12 in January 2016 did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  ASU 2014-09 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and the International Accounting Standards Board that: 
    removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; 
    provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; 
    improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; 
    provides more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements; and 
    simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. 
    
  ASU 2014-09 is effective, as amended, for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. While we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to have a material effect on our business, we are still evaluating any potential impact that adoption of ASU 2014-09 may have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

(2) BUSINESS ACQUISITION  
    
  On December 31, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of OF Holdings, Inc., sole parent of Octane Fitness, LLC ("Octane"), for an aggregate base purchase price of   $115.0 million  , plus net adjustments for working capital and cash acquired on the closing date. We funded the acquisition through an   $80.0 million   term loan and cash on hand.   
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Octane contributed net sales of   $16.2 million   and   $40.9 million  , respectively.  Octane contributed net income of   $1.1 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   $0.3 million   for the   first nine months   of   2016  . Operating results for the current three-month and year-to-date periods included amortization of acquired assets of   $0.8 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively, and purchase accounting related inventory step-up charges of   $0.1 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. Working capital and other measurement period adjustments as of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $0.7 million   and are detailed in the preliminary valuation table shown below. 
    
  Total acquisition costs incurred for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $0.3 million  , and cumulative-to-date costs total   $0.9 million  . These charges were expensed as incurred in general and administrative costs. 

7 

Purchase Price Allocation 
  Acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets resulted in the recognition of goodwill of   $58.3 million  , all of which was assigned to the Retail segment, and is attributed primarily to Octane's intellectual property base, benefits of access to different markets and customers, and employee workforce. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.  
    
  The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed and measurement period adjustments since December 31, 2015, the acquisition date (in thousands): 

The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and is based upon valuation information available and estimates and assumptions made as of   September 30, 2016  . We are still in the process of verifying data and finalizing information including valuation and recording of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the resulting amount of recognized goodwill.   
    
  The following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets and their estimated fair values and useful lives as of December 31, 2015, the acquisition date (dollars in thousands): 

8 

Summary of Unaudited Pro Forma Information 
  The following table reflects the unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the periods presented, as though the acquisition of Octane had occurred on January 1, 2015 (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized if the acquisition had been completed on the date indicated, nor is it indicative of future operating results.  

(3) DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
    
  There was   no   revenue related to discontinued operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or the year ended   December 31, 2015  . However, we continue to have legal and accounting expenses as we work with authorities on final deregistration of certain foreign entities and product liability expenses associated with product previously sold into the Commercial channel. 
    
  The following table summarizes liabilities for exit costs related to discontinued operations, included in accrued liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands): 

We expect the lease obligations to be paid out through   2016  . 

(4) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  Factors used in determining the fair value of financial assets and liabilities are summarized into three broad categories: 

Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active liquid markets for identical securities as of the reporting date; 
                
    Level 2 - other significant directly or indirectly observable inputs, including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk; or observable market prices in markets with insufficient volume and/or infrequent transactions; and 
                
    Level 3 - significant inputs that are generally unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, including our own assumptions in determining fair value. 

9 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows (in thousands): 

(1)    All certificates of deposit are within current FDIC insurance limits. 
    
  We did not have any liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  For our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we recognize transfers between levels at the actual date of the event or change in circumstance that caused the transfer. There were no transfers between levels during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , nor for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  We did not have any changes to our valuation techniques during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , nor for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  
   10 

We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale and, accordingly, record them at fair value. Level 1 investment valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Level 2 investment valuations are obtained from inputs, other than quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets, that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace and quoted prices in markets with limited volume or infrequent transactions. The factors or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. Unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and are reported net of tax in comprehensive income until realized.  
    
  The fair value of our interest rate swap contract is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount factors derived from relevant Level 2 market inputs, including forward curves and volatility levels. 
    
  We recognize or disclose the fair value of certain assets, such as non-financial assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and certain other long-lived assets in connection with impairment evaluations. All of our nonrecurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not perform any valuations on assets or liabilities that are valued at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the   first nine months   of   2016  . During the fourth quarter of   2015  , we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived trade names impairment analyses effective as of October 1,   2015  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we did not record any other-than-temporary impairments on our financial assets required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 

(5) DERIVATIVES  
    
  From time to time, we enter into interest rate swaps to fix a portion of our interest expense. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than to manage interest rate exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR benchmark. That is, we do not engage in interest rate speculation using derivative instruments.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a   $68.0 million   interest rate swap outstanding with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. This interest rate swap matures on   December 31, 2020   and has a fixed rate of   1.42%   per annum. The variable rate on the interest rate swap is the one-month LIBOR benchmark. At   September 30, 2016  , the one-month LIBOR rate was   0.52%  . 
    
  We typically designate all interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and, accordingly, record the change in fair value for the effective portion of these interest rate swaps in accumulated other comprehensive income rather than current period earnings until the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was no ineffectiveness. As of   September 30, 2016  , we expect to reclassify a loss of   $0.6 million   from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings within the next twelve months.  
    
  The fair value of our derivative instruments was included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (in thousands):

(10) PRODUCT WARRANTIES 
    
  Our products carry defined warranties for defects in materials or workmanship which, according to their terms, generally obligate us to pay the costs of supplying and shipping replacement parts to customers and, in certain instances, pay for labor and other costs to service products. Outstanding product warranty periods range from   thirty   days to, in limited circumstances, the   lifetime   of certain product components. We record a liability at the time of sale for the estimated costs of fulfilling future warranty claims. If necessary, we adjust the liability for specific warranty-related matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable. Estimated warranty expense is included in cost of sales, based on historical warranty claim experience and available product quality data. Warranty expense is affected by the performance of new products, significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to the customer, product failure rates, and higher or lower than expected repair costs. If warranty expense differs from previous estimates, or if circumstances change such that the assumptions inherent in previous estimates are no longer valid, the amount of product warranty obligations is adjusted accordingly. 
    
  Changes in our product warranty obligations were as follows (in thousands):

(11) ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) 
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes, reported on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets consists of unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, effective portions of gains and losses of derivative securities designated as cash flow hedges, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The following tables set forth the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax (in thousands) for the periods presented: 

(12) STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM 
    
  On   November 3, 2014  , our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to   $15.0 million   of our outstanding common stock from time to time during the ensuing period of   24   months. On   May 4, 2016  , our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our share repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to an additional   $10.0 million   of our outstanding common stock from time to time during the period of   24   months following such approval. Repurchases may be made in open market transactions at prevailing prices, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. Share repurchases are funded from existing cash balances, and the repurchased shares are retired and returned to unissued authorized shares. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of   $13.4 million   remained available for future repurchases. The repurchase program expires on   November 3, 2016   as to the approximately   $3.4 million   remaining available for repurchases under the original   $15.0 million

authorization. The repurchase program expires on   May 4, 2018   as to the   $10.0 million   available for repurchases under the   $10.0 million   expansion. 
    
  There were no repurchases during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Repurchases pursuant to the program were as follows: 

(13) INCOME PER SHARE 
    
  Basic per share amounts were computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted per share amounts were calculated using the number of basic weighted average shares outstanding increased by dilutive potential common shares related to stock-based awards, as determined by the treasury stock method. The weighted average numbers of shares outstanding used to compute income per share were as follows (in thousands): 

The weighted average numbers of shares outstanding listed in the table below were anti-dilutive and excluded from the computation of diluted income per share because the average market price did not exceed the exercise price. These shares may be dilutive potential common shares in the future (in thousands): 

(14) SEGMENT AND ENTERPRISE-WIDE INFORMATION 
    
  We operate in   three   segments - Direct, Retail, and Commercial and Specialty. Based on the aggregation criteria of ASC 280-10, we determined that   two   of the operating segments (Retail and Commercial and Specialty) can be aggregated due to these segments having similar economic and other characteristics. As a result, we have   two   reportable segments - Direct and Retail. This financial reporting structure was effective as of   December 31, 2015  , the date on which we acquired Octane.  
    
  We evaluate performance using several factors, of which the primary financial measures are net sales and reportable segment contribution.     Contribution is the measure of profit or loss, defined as net sales less product costs and directly attributable expenses. Directly attributable expenses include selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses that are directly related to segment operations. Segment assets are those directly assigned to an operating segment's operations, primarily accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill and other intangible assets. Unallocated assets primarily include cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, shared information technology infrastructure, distribution centers, corporate headquarters, prepaids and other current assets, deferred income tax assets and other assets. Capital expenditures directly attributable to the Direct and Retail segments were not significant in any period.   

16 

Following is summary information by reportable segment (in thousands): 

There was no material change in the allocation of assets by segment during the first   nine   months of   2016   and, accordingly, assets by segment are not presented. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Amazon.com accounted for   17.2%   and   12.1%  , respectively, of total net sales. For the   third quarter   of   2015  , Amazon.com represented   13.6%   of our total net sales, and   no   customer represented   10.0%   or more of total net sales for the   first nine months   of   2015  .  

(15) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Guarantees, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $0.6 million   in standby letters of credit with certain vendors expiring   April 2017  . 
    
  We have long lead times for inventory purchases and, therefore, must secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $35.0 million   in noncancelable market-based purchase obligations, primarily for inventory purchases expected to be received within the next   twelve   months. Purchase obligations can vary from quarter-to-quarter and versus the same period in prior years due to a number of factors, including the amount of products that are shipped directly to Retail customer warehouses versus through Nautilus warehouses. 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements that require us to indemnify counterparties against third-party claims. These may include: agreements with vendors and suppliers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from use of their products or services; agreements with customers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use or sale of our products; real estate and equipment leases, under which we may indemnify lessors against third-party claims relating to the use of their property; agreements with licensees or licensors, under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property; and agreements with parties to debt arrangements, under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions. 
    
  The nature and terms of these indemnification obligations vary from contract to contract, and generally a maximum obligation is not stated within the agreements. We hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain types of indemnification obligations. Management does not deem these obligations to be significant to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and, therefore, no related liabilities were recorded as of   September 30, 2016  .

Legal Matters 
  In 2004, we were sued in the Southern District of New York by BioSig Instruments, Inc. for alleged patent infringement in connection with our incorporation of heart rate monitors into certain cardio products. No significant activity in the litigation occurred until 2008. In 2012, the United States District Court granted summary judgment to us on grounds that BioSig s patents were invalid as a matter of law. BioSig appealed the grant of summary judgment and, in April 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the District Court s decision on summary judgment and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. On January 10, 2014, the U. S. Supreme Court granted our petition for a writ of certiorari to address the legal standard applied by the Federal Circuit in determining whether the patents may be valid under applicable law. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on April 28, 2014. By decision dated June 2, 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Federal Circuit, holding that its standard of when a patent may be  indefinite  was incorrect and remanding to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration under the correct standard. The remand hearing in the Federal Circuit was held on October 29, 2014.  By decision dated April 27, 2015, the same panel of the Federal Circuit affirmed its earlier reversal of the District Court s decision on summary judgment. On May 27, 2015, we filed a petition for a rehearing en banc in the Federal Circuit, which was denied on August 4, 2015 and a Petition for Review by the U. S. Supreme Court which was also denied.  The case has been returned to the District Court, and the parties are currently engaged in discovery and other pre-trial motion practice. We do not believe that our use of heart rate monitors utilized or purchased from third parties, and otherwise, infringes the BioSig patents. 
    
  In addition to the matter described above, from time to time, we may be involved in various claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. These legal and tax proceedings involve uncertainty as to the eventual outcomes and losses which may be realized when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.  
    
  Litigation and jury verdicts are, to some degree, inherently unpredictable, and although we have determined that a loss is not probable in connection with any current legal proceeding, it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred in connection with proceedings to which we are a party. Assessment of whether incurrence of a loss is probable, or a reasonable possibility, in connection with a particular proceeding, and estimation of the loss, or a range of loss, involves complex judgments and numerous uncertainties. Management is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses related to litigation in which the damages sought are indeterminate, or the legal and factual basis for the relevant claims have not been developed with specificity.  As such, zero liability is recorded as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and, as additional information becomes known, may change our estimates accordingly. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings, investigations or claims that could affect the amount of any accrual, as well as any developments that would make a loss probable or reasonably possible, and whether the amount of a probable or reasonably possible loss is estimable. Among other factors, we evaluate the advice of internal and external counsel, the outcomes from similar litigation, current status of the lawsuits (including settlement initiatives), legislative developments and other factors. Due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties.

Item 2.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements as of the dates and for the periods presented in this section. You should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Form 10-K ). All references to the   third quarter   and   first nine months   of   2016   and   2015   mean the   three and nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Unless the context otherwise requires,  Nautilus,   we,   us  and  our  refer to Nautilus, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Unless indicated otherwise, all information regarding our operating results pertains to our continuing operations.  
    
  Our results of operations may vary significantly from period-to-period. Our revenues typically fluctuate due to the seasonality of our industry, customer buying patterns, product innovation, the nature and level of competition for health and fitness products, our ability to procure products to meet customer demand, the level of spending on, and effectiveness of, our media and advertising programs and our ability to attract new customers and maintain existing sales relationships. In addition, our revenues are highly susceptible to economic factors, including, among other things, the overall condition of the economy and the availability of consumer credit in both the United States and Canada. Our profit margins may vary in response to the aforementioned factors and our ability to manage product costs. Profit margins may also be affected by fluctuations in the costs or availability of materials used to manufacture our products, costs associated with acquisition or license of products and technologies, product warranty costs, the cost of fuel, and changes in costs of other distribution or manufacturing-related services. Our operating profits or losses may also be affected by the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Historically, our operating expenses have been influenced by media costs to produce and distribute advertisements of our products on television, the Internet and other media, facility costs, operating costs of our information and communications systems, product supply chain management, customer support and new product development activities. In addition, our operating expenses have been affected from time-to-time by asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other significant unusual or infrequent expenses. 
    
  As a result of the above and other factors, our period-to-period operating results may not be indicative of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on our operating results and should consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties typically encountered by us and other companies, both within and outside our industry. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties and, consequently, we cannot assure you of any future growth or profitability. For more information, see our discussion of risk factors located at Part I, Item 1A of our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  Forward-Looking Statements  
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "plan," "expect," "aim," "believe," "project," "intend," "estimate," "will," "should," "could," and other terms of similar meaning typically identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include any statements related to our future business and financial performance; anticipated fluctuations in net sales due to seasonality; plans and expectations regarding gross and operating margins; plans and expectations regarding research and development expenses and capital expenditures; anticipated losses from discontinued operations; the anticipated outcome of litigation to which we are a party; results of media investment in the Direct segment; plans for new product introductions and anticipated demand for our new and existing products; and statements regarding our inventory and working capital requirements and the sufficiency of our financial resources. These forward-looking statements, and others we make from time-to-time, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements, including our ability to timely acquire inventory that meets our quality control standards from sole source foreign manufacturers at acceptable costs, the effectiveness, availability and price of media time consistent with our cost and audience profile parameters, greater than anticipated costs associated with launch of new products, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, a decline in consumer spending due to unfavorable economic conditions, softness in the retail marketplace, an adverse change in the availability of credit for our customers who finance their purchases, our ability to pass along vendor raw material price increases and increased shipping costs, our ability to effectively develop, market and sell future products, our ability to protect our intellectual property, the introduction of competing products, and our ability to get foreign-sourced product through customs in a timely manner.  Additional assumptions, risks and uncertainties are described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our   2015   Form 10-K as supplemented or modified in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. We do not undertake any duty to update forward-looking statements after the date they are made or conform them to actual results or to changes in circumstances or expectations.

Overview 
    
  We are committed to providing innovative, quality solutions to help people achieve a fit and healthy lifestyle. Our principal business activities include designing, developing, sourcing and marketing high-quality cardio and strength fitness products and related accessories for consumer use, primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. Our products are sold under some of the most-recognized brand names in the fitness industry: Nautilus       , Bowflex       , Octane Fitness       , Schwinn        and Universal       . 
    
  We market our products through two distinct distribution channels, Direct and Retail, which we consider to be separate business segments. Our   Direct   business offers products directly to consumers through television advertising, catalogs and the Internet. Our   Retail   business offers our products through a network of independent retail companies and specialty retailers with stores and websites located in the United States and internationally. We also derive a portion of our revenue from the licensing of our brands and intellectual property. 
    
  Net sales for the   first nine months   of   2016   were   $280.3 million  , an   increase   of   $53.7 million  , or   23.7%  , as compared to net sales of   $226.6 million   for the   first nine months   of   2015  . Net sales of our Direct segment   increased     $1.3 million  , or   0.8%  , in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to the   first nine months   of   2015  , primarily due to increased consumer demand for our cardio products. Net sales of our Retail segment increased by   $53.5 million  , or   83.1%  , in the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to the   first nine months   of   2015  , primarily due to the addition of Octane sales, coupled with strong organic Retail sales growth across both cardio and strength product offerings. 
    
  Gross profit for the   first nine months   of   2016   was   $147.4 million  , or   52.6%   of net sales, an   increase   of   $26.7 million  , or   22.1%  , as compared to gross profit of   $120.8 million  , or   53.3%   of net sales, for the   first nine months   of   2015  . The   increase   in gross profit dollars was primarily due to the increase in net sales as well as margin improvements.  
    
  Operating expenses for the   first nine months   of   2016   were   $113.3 million  , an   increase   of   $20.5 million  , or   22.1%  , as compared to operating expenses of   $92.8 million   for the   first nine months   of   2015  . The growth in operating expenses was primarily related to the incremental operating expenses of the acquired Octane business.  
    
  Operating income for the   first nine months   of   2016   was   $34.1 million  , an   increase   of   $6.2 million  , or   22.1%  , as compared to operating income of   $27.9 million   for the   first nine months   of   2015  . The improvement in operating results for the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to the   first nine months   of   2015   was driven primarily by higher net sales and improved gross profits. 
    
  Income from continuing operations was   $23.1 million   for the   first nine months   of   2016  , or   $0.74   per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of   $17.0 million  , or   $0.53   per diluted share, for the   first nine months   of   2015  . The effective tax rates for the   first nine months   of   2016   and   2015   were   29.4%   and   38.7%  , respectively.  
    
  Net income for the   first nine months   of   2016   was   $22.6 million  , compared to net income of   $16.9 million   for the   first nine months   of   2015  . Net income per diluted share was   $0.72   for the   first nine months   of   2016  , compared to   $0.53   for the   first nine months   of   2015  . In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Company recognized a non-recurring tax benefit of $2.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, related to the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits upon completing deregistration of a non-U.S. entity. 
    
  Discontinued Operations 
    
  Results from discontinued operations relate to the disposal of our former Commercial business, which was completed in April 2011. We reached substantial completion of asset liquidation at December 31, 2012. Although there was no revenue related to the Commercial business in either the   2016   or   2015   periods, we continue to have legal and accounting expenses as we work with authorities on final deregistration of each entity, and product liability and other legal expenses associated with product previously sold into the Commercial channel.

The following table compares the net sales of our major product lines within each business segment (dollars in thousands): 

Direct           
    
  Direct net sales   decreased     21.4%   and   increased     0.8%  , respectively, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods of   2015  . The   decrease   in net sales in the   third quarter   of   2016   was primarily related to a decline in the media response rate for cardio products, resulting in a decision to defer advertising spending during the quarter to ensure a profitable return on media investment. The   increase   in net sales for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily related to   an increase   in net sales of our cardio products.  
    
  Combined consumer credit approvals by our primary and secondary U.S. third-party financing providers for the   third quarter   of   2016   was   47.9%  , compared to   47.8%   in the same period of   2015  .  
    
  The   $3.7 million     decrease   in cost of sales of our Direct business in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the same period of   2015   was due to lower net sales. The   $3.1 million     decrease   in cost of sales in the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   was due to favorable product mix and lower reserve requirements partially offset by the increase in net sales. 
    
  For the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , Direct gross margin increased   140   and   220   basis points, respectively, as compared to the same periods of   2015   primarily due to product mix and lower reserve requirements. 

23 

Retail    
    
  Retail net sales   increased   by   79.6%   and   83.1%  , respectively, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods of   2015  . The   increase  s were primarily driven by the acquisition of Octane, as well as organic growth across a variety of cardio and strength products.  
    
  The   increase  s in cost of sales of our Retail business for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods of   2015   were almost entirely related to the growth in Retail net sales as discussed above. 
    
  For the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , Retail gross margin   increased     950   and   910   basis points, respectively,  compared to the same periods of   2015   due to the inclusion of Octane, which has higher margins, along with leveraging of supply chain costs and lower reserve requirements in the organic Retail business. The margin increases for the   three and nine   month periods of   2016   are net of purchase price accounting-related inventory step-up charges of   $0.1 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively, that are included in cost of sales. 
    
  Selling and Marketing  

The   $0.3 million     decrease   in selling and marketing expense in the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   was primarily related to lower media advertising of   $1.7 million  , lower variable sales expenses of   $1.4 million  , and partially offset by incremental selling and marketing expenses related to the inclusion of Octane of   $2.5 million  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the year-over-year   increase   was primarily attributable to incremental selling and marketing expenses related to Octane and   increased   media spend of   $7.5 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively.  
    
  The   decrease  s in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales in the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods of   2015   were primarily due to the acquisition of Octane and growth in the organic Retail business, both of which have a lower selling and marketing expense percentage than the company average. 
    
  Media advertising expense of our Direct business is the largest component of selling and marketing and was as follows: 

The   decrease   in media advertising in the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   was primarily related to a decision to defer advertising spending during the quarter to ensure a profitable return on media investment, in response to a decline in the media response rate for cardio products. 
    
  The   increase   in media advertising in the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   was primarily to drive incremental leads and sales in the Direct business. 

24 

General and Administrative 

The   increase   in general and administrative in the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   was primarily due to the addition of Octane of   $1.1 million   and amortization of Octane acquired assets of   $0.8 million  , partially offset by lower patent and legal charges and a reduction in employee incentive compensation costs of   $0.7 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  , the   increase   was attributable to the inclusion of the Octane business in the amount of   $2.9 million  , amortization of Octane acquired assets of   $2.3 million  , acquisition-related consulting expenses of   $0.5 million  , and non-recurrence of a state business tax refund of $0.5 million received in the second quarter of 2015. 
    
  The   increase   in general and administrative as a percentage of net sales in the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   was due to the inclusion of Octane and other increased spending as discussed above. 
    
  Research and Development 

The   increase  s in research and development in the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods of   2015   were primarily due to our investment in additional engineering and product development headcount as we continue to supplement our new product development resources required to innovate and broaden our product portfolio, coupled with the incremental impact of the research and development expenses related to Octane. 
    
  The   increase  s in research and development as a percentage of net sales in the   three and nine   month periods of   2016   compared to the same periods of   2015   were primarily due to the increased investment discussed above. 
    
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense   increased     $0.5 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods of   2015   due to borrowings under our term loan in connection with the Octane acquisition on   December 31, 2015  .   
    
  Other, Net 
  Other, net relates to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. and our foreign subsidiaries, primarily Canada, China and Europe.  

25 

Income Tax Expense        

The decreases in income tax expense from continuing operations for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods of   2015   were primarily attributed to the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with certain non-U.S. filing positions. These resulted from completion of the deregistration process of a certain foreign entity during the third quarter of 2016.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had total cash and investments of   $59.3 million   compared to   $60.8 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . Cash provided by operating activities was   $14.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $18.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . We expect our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities at   September 30, 2016  , along with cash expected to be generated from operations, to be sufficient to fund our operating and capital requirements for at least twelve months from   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The   decrease   in cash flows from operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period of   2015   was primarily due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities as discussed below, partially offset by improved operating performance. 
    
  Trade receivables   decreased     $13.9 million   to   $31.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $45.2 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , due to seasonally lower net sales in the Retail business. Trade receivables as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015     increased     $12.2 million   due to the acquisition of Octane. 
    
  Inventories   increased     $6.5 million   to   $49.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $42.7 million   as of   December 31, 2015   due to seasonal preparations for the coming fourth quarter. Inventories as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015     increased   by   $13.7 million  , primarily due to the acquisition of Octane. 
    
  Net deferred income tax liability   increased     $3.9 million   to   $13.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $9.5 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to the utilization of tax credit carryforwards from prior periods. 
    
  Trade payables   decreased     $17.0 million   to   $44.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $61.7 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , due to seasonality in the business. Trade payables as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015     increased     $5.9 million  . The higher amount outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to addition of the Octane business. 
    
  Accrued liabilities   decreased     $3.6 million   to   $9.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $13.0 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , due to a reduction in accrued incentive compensation in the   first nine months   of   2016  , reflecting payout of incentive compensation during the first quarter. 
    
  Cash used in investing activities of   $4.8 million   for the   first nine months   of   2016   was primarily related to   $3.5 million   of payments to Octane under the   December 31, 2015   stock purchase agreement, partially offset by net maturities of marketable securities of   $1.9 million  . In addition,   $3.2 million   was used for capital expenditures during the period primarily for production tooling and computer hardware and software. We anticipate spending between   $5.0 million   and   $6.0 million   in   2016   for software, equipment, and product tooling.   
    
  Cash used in financing activities of   $9.8 million   for the   first nine months   of   2016   was related to repayments on our term loan of   $12.0 million  , partially offset by   $1.9 million   of recognized excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.  

26 

Financing Arrangements 
  We have a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( Chase Bank ) that provides for an   $80.0 million   term loan and a   $20.0 million   revolving line of credit. The term of the Credit Agreement expires on December 31, 2020 and is secured by substantially all of our assets. 
    
  The Credit Agreement, as amended, contains customary covenants, including minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and funded debt to EBITDA ratio, and limitations on capital expenditures, mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, liens, dispositions, dividends and investments. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Upon an event of default, the lender may terminate its credit line commitment, accelerate all outstanding obligations and exercise its remedies under the continuing security agreement.  
    
  Borrowing availability under the revolving line of credit is subject to our compliance with certain financial and operating covenants at the time borrowings are requested. Letters of credit under the Credit Agreement are treated as a reduction of the available borrowing amount and are subject to covenant testing. 
    
  The interest rate applicable to the term loan, as well as each advance under the revolving line of credit, is based on either Chase Bank's floating prime rate or adjusted LIBOR, plus an applicable margin. As of   September 30, 2016   our borrowing rate for both the term loan and line of credit advances was   1.77%  .  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance on our term loan was   $68.0 million  , and we had   no   outstanding borrowings under the line of credit. In addition,   $0.6 million   in letters of credit that expire in   April 2017   were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement and approximately   $19.4 million   was available for borrowing under the line of credit. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a   $68.0 million   receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swap outstanding with Chase Bank. The interest rate swap amortizes monthly in line with the outstanding principal balance on our term loan and is classified as a cash flow hedge. The swap matures on   December 31, 2020   and has a fixed rate of   1.42%   per annum. The variable rate on the interest rate swap is the one-month LIBOR benchmark. At   September 30, 2016  , the one-month LIBOR rate was   0.52%  . 
    
  Commitments and Contingencies 
  For a description of our commitments and contingencies, refer to Note 15 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements that require us to indemnify counterparties against third-party claims. These may include: agreements with vendors and suppliers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services; agreements with customers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use or sale of our products; real estate and equipment leases, under which we may indemnify lessors against third-party claims relating to the use of their property; agreements with licensees or licensors, under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property; and agreements with parties to debt arrangements, under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions. 
    
  The nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract, and generally a maximum obligation is not stated. We hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain types of indemnifications. Because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation, and because management does not expect these obligations to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, no liabilities are recorded at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Stock Repurchase Program 
  On   November 3, 2014  , our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to   $15.0 million   of our outstanding common stock from time to time during the ensuing period of   24   months. On   May 4, 2016  , our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our share repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to an additional   $10.0 million   of our outstanding common stock from time to time during the period of   24   months following such approval. Repurchases may be made in open market transactions at prevailing prices, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. Share repurchases are funded from existing cash balances, and the repurchased shares are retired and returned to unissued authorized shares. 

27 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we have repurchased   711,708   shares at an average price of   $16.25     per share for a total of     $11.6 million  , and     $13.4 million     remained available for future repurchases.   The repurchase program expires on   November 3, 2016   as to the approximately   $3.4 million   remaining available for repurchases under the original   $15.0 million   authorization. The repurchase program expires on   May 4, 2018   as to the   $10.0 million   available for repurchases under the   $10.0 million   expansion. 
    
  SEASONALITY 
    
  We expect our sales from fitness equipment products to vary seasonally. Sales are typically strongest in the first and fourth quarters, followed by the third quarter, and are generally weakest in the second quarter. We believe that, during the spring and summer months, consumers tend to be involved in outdoor activities, including outdoor exercise, which impacts sales of indoor fitness equipment. This seasonality can have a significant effect on our inventory levels, working capital needs and resource utilization. 
    
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
    
  Our critical accounting policies have not changed from those discussed in our   2015   Form 10-K. 

Item 3.  
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
       
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents, marketable securities,  variable-rate debt obligations, and derivative liabilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash equivalents of   $5.5 million   held in a combination of money market funds and commercial paper, and marketable securities of   $28.1 million  , held in a combination of certificates of deposit, corporate bonds, and U.S. government bonds. Our cash equivalents mature within three months or less from the date of purchase. Marketable securities with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. We have classified our marketable securities as available-for-sale and, therefore, we may choose to sell or hold them as changes in the market occur. Because of the short-term nature of the instruments in our portfolio, a decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income over time, and an increase in interest rates may negatively affect the market price or liquidity of certain securities within the portfolio, but a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
    
  Our negotiated credit facilities generally charge interest based on a benchmark rate such as LIBOR. Fluctuations in short-term interest rates may cause interest payments on term loan principal and drawn amounts on the revolving line to increase or decrease. As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balances on our credit facilities totaled   $68.0 million  . 
    
  In January 2016, we entered into an   $80.0 million   receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swap agreement, amortizing monthly in line with the outstanding principal balance on our term loan. The swap is classified as a cash flow hedge and effectively fixes the interest rate on our variable-rate term loan. The interest rate swap matures on   December 31, 2020   and has a fixed interest rate of   1.42%   per annum. The variable rate on the interest rate swap is the one-month LIBOR benchmark, which was   0.52%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The fair value of our interest rate swap agreement represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement. The amounts related to our cash flow hedge are recorded as deferred gains or losses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement was a liability of   $0.9 million  . The estimated amount expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months was   $0.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than to manage our interest rate exposure. That is, we do not engage in interest rate speculation using derivative instruments. 

28 

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures  
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  In accordance with Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a- 15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon their evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  At this time, we continue to evaluate the business and internal controls and processes associated with Octane and are making various changes to its operating and organizational structure based on our business plan. We are in the process of implementing our internal control structure over this acquired business. The SEC s rules require us to include acquired entities in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting no later than the annual management report following the first anniversary of the acquisition. We plan to complete the evaluation and the integration of Octane within the required time frames and report management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting in our first annual report in which such assessment is required for this acquisition.  
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.    OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
       
  Patent Infringement Case 
  In 2004, we were sued in the Southern District of New York by BioSig Instruments, Inc. for alleged patent infringement in connection with our incorporation of heart rate monitors into certain cardio products. No significant activity in the litigation occurred until 2008. In 2012, the United States District Court granted summary judgment to us on grounds that BioSig s patents 
  were invalid as a matter of law. BioSig appealed the grant of summary judgment and, in April 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the District Court s decision on summary judgment and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. On January 10, 2014, the U. S. Supreme Court granted our petition for a writ of certiorari to address the legal standard applied by the Federal Circuit in determining whether the patents may be valid under applicable law. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on April 28, 2014. By decision dated June 2, 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Federal Circuit, holding that its standard of when a patent may be  indefinite  was incorrect and remanding to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration under the correct standard. The remand hearing in the Federal Circuit was held on October 29, 2014.  By decision dated April 27, 2015, the same panel of the Federal Circuit affirmed its earlier reversal of the District Court s decision on summary judgment. On May 27, 2015, we filed a petition for a rehearing en banc in the Federal Circuit, which was denied on August 4, 2015 and a Petition for Review by the U. S. Supreme Court which was also denied. The case has been returned to the District Court, and the parties are currently engaged in discovery and other pre-trial motion practice. We do not believe that our use of heart rate monitors utilized or purchased from third parties, and otherwise, infringes the BioSig patents.   
    
  In addition to the matter described above, from time to time we are subject to litigation, claims and assessments that arise in the ordinary course of business, including disputes that may arise from intellectual property related matters. Management believes that any liability resulting from such additional matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

29 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
    
  We operate in an environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described in our   2015   Form 10-K are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that presently are not considered material or are not known to us, and therefore are not mentioned herein, may impair our business operations. If any of the risks described in our   2015   Form 10-K actually occur, our business, operating results and financial position could be adversely affected. There has not been a material change to the risk factors as set forth in our   2015   Form 10-K.
