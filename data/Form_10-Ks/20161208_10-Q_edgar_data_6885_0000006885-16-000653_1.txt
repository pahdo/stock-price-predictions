  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

1.                Basis of Presentation 
       
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Stage Stores, Inc. and its subsidiary ( we,   us  or  our ) have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements. Those adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods have been made. Results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year due to seasonal and other factors. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 30, 2016   ( Form 10-K ).           
  References to a particular year are to our fiscal year, which is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31st of the following calendar year.  For example, a reference to  2016  is a reference to the fiscal year ending January 28, 2017, and  2015  is a reference to the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016.  Each of 2016 and 2015 are comprised of 52 weeks. 
    
    Customer Loyalty Program  .  Prior to the third quarter of 2016, customers who spent a required amount within a specified time frame using our private label credit card received reward certificates which could be redeemed for merchandise. We estimated the net cost of the rewards and recorded a liability associated with unredeemed certificates and customer spend toward unissued certificates. The cost of the loyalty rewards program was recorded in cost of sales. In the third quarter of 2016, we expanded our loyalty program to enable all customers to earn benefits regardless of how they choose to pay. We record deferred revenue for the retail value of certificates earned, net of estimated breakage, as customers make purchases towards earning reward certificates. 
    
   Recent Accounting Standards  . In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. The core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what a company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 allows for either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method of adoption. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The new revenue standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending February 2, 2019. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.           
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from finance and operating leases on the balance sheet. In addition, this guidance requires disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending February 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and we expect that our reported assets and liabilities will significantly increase under the new standard.           
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which modifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under the new standard, excess income tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to equity awards that vest or settle will be recognized as income tax expense, rather than within additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. The recognition of excess tax benefits and losses may create significant volatility in earnings. We do not expect the adoption of the other requirements of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The new standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending February 3, 2018.   
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which provides guidance on certain specific cash flow issues including proceeds received from the settlement of insurance claims. This guidance requires cash proceeds received from the settlement of insurance claims to be classified on the statement of cash flows on the basis of the related insurance coverage (that is, the nature of the loss). The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

2.                Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  Stock-based compensation expense by type of grant for each period presented was as follows (in thousands): 

As of   October 29, 2016  , we have unrecognized compensation cost of   $18.6 million   related to stock-based compensation awards granted. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   2.4 years  . 
    
  SARs 
    
  Prior to 2012, we granted stock options and SARs to our employees, which generally vested over   four years   from the date of grant. There were no stock options outstanding as of January 30, 2016. Outstanding SARs will expire, if not exercised or forfeited, within   seven years   from the date of grant. Exercised SARs are settled by the issuance of common stock in an amount equal to the increase in our stock price between the grant date and the exercise date. 
    
  The following table summarizes SARs activity for the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016  :  

No SARs were exercised during the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016  . The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised during the   nine months ended     October 31, 2015   was   $0.9 million  .

     Table of Contents  

Non-vested Stock 
    
  We grant shares of non-vested stock to our employees and non-employee directors. The non-vested stock converts   one-for-one   to common stock at the end of the vesting period at no cost to the recipient to whom it is awarded. The vesting period of the non-vested stock ranges from   one   to   four years   from the date of grant. 
    
  The following table summarizes non-vested stock activity for the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016  : 

The weighted-average grant date fair value for non-vested stock granted during the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   was   $6.78   and   $20.65  , respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic value of non-vested stock that vested during the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , was   $2.7 million   and   $5.4 million  , respectively. The payment of the employees  tax liability for a portion of the vested shares was satisfied by withholding shares with a fair value equal to the tax liability. As a result, the actual number of shares issued during   nine months ended     October 29, 2016   was   289,757  . 
    
  Performance Shares 
    
  We grant performance shares as a means of rewarding management for our long-term performance based on shareholder return performance measures. The actual number of shares that may be issued ranges from   zero   to a maximum of twice the number of granted shares outstanding, as reflected in the table below, and is based on our shareholder return performance relative to a specific group of companies over a   3  -year performance cycle. If earned, the performance shares vest following the   3  -year cycle. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the vesting period and is based on the fair value at grant date as determined using a Monte Carlo probability model. Grant recipients do not have any shareholder rights until the granted shares have been issued. 
    
  The following table summarizes information about the performance shares that were outstanding at   October 29, 2016  : 

The weighted-average grant date fair value for performance shares granted during the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   was   $8.69   and   $28.33  , respectively. For the 2013 performance grant, none of the   112,750   target shares that were outstanding at   January 30, 2016   were earned. The aggregate intrinsic value of performance shares that vested during the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   was   $0.1 million   and   $4.9 million  , respectively.  The payment of the employees  tax liability for the vested shares was satisfied by withholding shares with a fair value equal to the tax liability. As a result, the actual number of shares issued during   nine months ended     October 29, 2016   was   11,323  .

3.                Debt Obligations  
    
  Debt obligations for each period presented consisted of the following (in thousands): 

On   October 6, 2014  , we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement for a   $300.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility ( Revolving Credit Facility ) with a seasonal increase to   $350.0 million   and a   $50.0 million   letter of credit subfacility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on   October 6, 2019  .  
    
  We use the Revolving Credit Facility to provide financing for working capital and general corporate purposes, as well as to finance capital expenditures and to support our letter of credit requirements. Borrowings are limited to the availability under a borrowing base that is determined principally on eligible inventory as defined by the Revolving Credit Facility agreement. Inventory, cash and cash equivalents are pledged as collateral. The daily interest rates are determined by a prime rate or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, as set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement. For the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings and the average daily borrowings were   1.83%   and   $188.0 million  , respectively. 
    
  Letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility support certain merchandise purchases and collateralize retained risks and deductibles under various insurance programs. At   October 29, 2016  , outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately   $5.7 million  . These letters of credit expire within   twelve months   of issuance. Excess borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility at   October 29, 2016   was   $112.2 million  . 
    
  The Revolving Credit Facility agreement contains covenants which, among other things, restrict, based on required levels of excess availability, (i) the amount of additional debt or capital lease obligations, (ii) the payment of dividends to   $30 million   in a fiscal year, and (iii) the repurchase of common stock under certain circumstances. The agreement also contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in the event excess availability is below a defined threshold or an event of default has occurred. At   October 29, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of the debt covenants of the Revolving Credit Facility agreement and we expect to remain in compliance. 
    
  During the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016  , we borrowed approximately   $5.8 million   under an equipment financing note bearing an effective interest rate of   3.2%  . The equipment financing note is payable in monthly installments over a   three  -year term and is secured by certain equipment.

4.                Earnings per Share 
    
  The following tables show the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for each period presented (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

The number of shares attributable to stock options, SARs and non-vested stock grants that would have been considered dilutive securities, but were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the effect was anti-dilutive, were as follows (in thousands): 

5.                Stockholders  Equity 
    
  On   November 17, 2016  , our Board of Directors ( Board ) declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.15   per share of common stock, payable on   December 14, 2016   to shareholders of record at the close of business on   November 29, 2016  .

6.                Pension Plan 
    
  We sponsor a frozen defined benefit pension plan. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): 

Our funding policy is to make contributions to maintain the minimum funding requirements for our pension obligations in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. We may elect to contribute additional amounts to maintain a level of funding to minimize the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premium costs or to cover the short-term liquidity needs of the plan in order to maintain current invested positions. We made no contributions during the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016  . 

7.                Fair Value Measurements 
    
  We recognize or disclose the fair value of our financial and non-financial assets and liabilities on a recurring and non-recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, we assume the highest and best use of the asset by market participants in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 
    
  We apply the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels, and base the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: 
                 Level 1   
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2   
    Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3   
    Inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement reflect our estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

(a)    In accordance with ASC No. 360-10,   Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  , we review the carrying value of long-lived assets periodically and when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment has occurred. Using an undiscounted cash flow model, we evaluate the cash flow trends of our stores to identify property, equipment and leasehold improvements that may not be fully recoverable. When a store s projected undiscounted cash flows indicate impairment, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the underlying long-lived assets. An impairment write-down is recorded if the carrying value of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include, among other things, expected future operating performance, including expected closure date and lease term, and changes in economic conditions. For the   nine months ended     October 29, 2016   and fiscal year   2015  , we recognized impairment charges of   $0.5 million   and   $10.6 million  , respectively. Impairment charges are recorded in cost of sales and related buying, occupancy and distribution expenses. We believe estimated future cash flows are sufficient to support the carrying value of our long-lived assets. If estimated cash flows significantly differ in the future, there could be additional asset impairments. 
    
  Due to the short-term nature of cash and cash equivalents, payables and short-term debt obligations, the carrying value approximates the fair value of these instruments. In addition, we believe that the Revolving Credit Facility obligation approximates its fair value because interest rates are adjusted daily based on current market rates.

ITEM 2.   
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 
    
  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ( Act ) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the statements. We wish to take advantage of the  safe harbor  provisions of the Act. 
    
  Certain statements in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act, and such statements are intended to qualify for the protection of the safe harbor provided by the Act. The words  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   objective,   goal,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe,   will,   should,   may,   target,   forecast,   guidance,   outlook,  and similar expressions generally identify forward-looking statements. Similarly, descriptions of our objectives, strategies, plans, goals or targets are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate to the expectations of management as to future occurrences and trends, including statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results or events and projected sales, earnings, capital expenditures and business strategy.  
    
  Forward-looking statements are based upon a number of assumptions and factors concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements that are made herein and in other reports and releases are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the ability for us to maintain normal trade terms with vendors, the ability for us to comply with the various covenant requirements contained in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement, the demand for apparel, and other factors. The demand for apparel and sales volume can be affected by significant changes in economic conditions, including an economic downturn, employment levels in our markets, consumer confidence, energy and gasoline prices, the value of the Mexican peso, and other factors influencing discretionary consumer spending. Other factors affecting the demand for apparel and sales volume include unusual weather patterns, an increase in the level of competition in our market areas, competitors  marketing strategies, changes in fashion trends, changes in the average cost of merchandise purchased for resale, availability of product on normal payment terms and the failure to achieve the expected results of our merchandising and marketing plans as well as our store opening or relocation plans. Additional assumptions, factors and risks concerning future conditions are discussed in the Risk Factors section of the Form 10-K, and may be discussed from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, including Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond our control.  
    
  Forward-looking statements are and will be based upon management s then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. Although management believes the expectations expressed in forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge, forward-looking statements, by their nature, involve risks, uncertainties and other factors, any one or a combination of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  Readers should carefully review the Form 10-K in its entirety including, but not limited to, our financial statements and the notes thereto and the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A -  Risk Factors  of the Form 10-K. This report should be read in conjunction with the Form 10-K, and you should consider all of these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating forward-looking statements. 
    
  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our public announcements and SEC filings.

  The financial information, discussion and analysis that follow should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Form 10-Q as well as the financial and other information included in the Form 10-K. 
    
  Our Business 
    
  We are a retailer operating specialty department stores primarily in small and mid-sized towns and communities. Our merchandise assortment is a well-edited selection of moderately priced brand name and private label apparel, accessories, cosmetics, footwear and home goods. As of   October 29, 2016  , we operated   820   specialty department stores located in   38   states under the BEALLS, GOODY S, PALAIS ROYAL, PEEBLES and STAGE nameplates and a direct-to-consumer business.  
    
  Results of Operations  
    
  Select financial results for the   third quarter 2016   were as follows (comparisons are to the   third quarter 2015  ): 

Comparable sales decreased   8.2%  . 
                 
    Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses decreased   $7.5 million  , or   8.2%  .  
                 
    Adjusted diluted loss per common share (non-GAAP) was (  $0.57  ), compared with (  $0.29  ) (see reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures on page 17). 
                
    We declared and paid cash dividends of $4.2 million, or $0.15 per common share.   
                
    Inventories were down approximately 8%. 
       
  2016 Strategy and Outlook 
    
  Sales for the year-to-date 2016 were lower compared to the year-to-date 2015, primarily attributable to a decline in traffic in our stores. Sales for the year-to-date 2016 have been particularly challenged in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico, which have been impacted by depressed oil prices and the weak Mexican peso. Compared with the first and second quarter 2016, comparable sales for the third quarter 2016 improved slightly. We have responded to the challenging sales environment by controlling our inventories, reducing expenses and lowering capital expenditures.  
    
  During the third quarter 2016, we took additional markdowns to move clearance merchandise and we had a clean, fresh inventory position going into the fourth quarter. We have increased our emphasis on gifts for the holiday season, building upon last year s well received selection of men s gifts and adding an extensive collection of items for women, including new bath and cosmetic offerings and hair styling products. We also have a strong assortment of seasonal apparel, including lightweight sweaters, fleece and outerwear. In our women s categories, we have focused on popular trends, such as little black dresses, bomber jackets and fashion boots.   
    
  We scaled back our advertising and store expenses during the   year-to-date 2016   to be better positioned to invest in these areas for the holiday season. We plan to increase the presence of sales associates in our stores to provide a higher level of customer service during the holiday season and we have several new promotions that align with the heavier shopping periods. We will also be reaching out to more customers through our marketing campaigns to highlight our merchandise offerings and our stores will feature improved signage to showcase our value and compelling price points. 
    
  We are offering greater value to our customers with our tender-neutral loyalty program, Style Circle Rewards , which we launched in the third quarter 2016. This new loyalty club complements our existing private label credit card program and will allow us to better understand our customers  shopping habits, offer even more personalized promotional offers, and provide attractive rewards. We believe that these loyalty programs provide enhanced benefits to our customers and are powerful tools to drive higher transaction value and frequency of visits.

     Table of Contents  

During the year-to-date 2016, we have made strategic investments in our stores and our e-commerce technology to create a more enjoyable shopping experience for our customers. We remodeled and refreshed an additional 85 stores, and have updated over 200 stores representing approximately 45% of our sales base since the initiative began in 2015. The investments in our stores include improved lighting, upgraded fixtures, comfortable fitting rooms and enhanced layouts. We have also improved the navigation of our website to make it simpler and faster to shop and we continue to enhance the functionality of our mobile app. 
    
  As part of our strategic initiative to exit stores that do not meet our sales productivity and profitability benchmarks, we closed 15 stores during the year-to-date 2016, and we expect to close approximately 35 stores in total for 2016. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The following supplemental information presents the results from operations for the three and nine months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis to show earnings excluding charges related to: (i) our corporate headquarters consolidation, which includes duplicate rent expense and moving related costs; (ii) severance associated with our workforce reduction initiative; and (iii) our strategic store closures, which includes fixture moving costs and lease termination charges. We believe this supplemental financial information enhances an investor s understanding of our financial performance as it excludes those items which impact comparability of operating trends.  The non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net loss, diluted loss per common share, cash flow from operations or other measures of performance as defined by GAAP.  Moreover, the inclusion of non-GAAP financial information as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of presentation and items considered.  The following tables set forth the supplemental financial information and the reconciliation of GAAP disclosures to non-GAAP financial measures (in thousands, except diluted loss per common share):

Third   Quarter 2016 Compared to   Third   Quarter 2015 
    
  The following table sets forth the results of operations for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages): 

Net Sales 
    
  Sales for the   third quarter 2016   of   $317.1 million   decreased $34.4 million, or   9.8%  , from   $351.6 million   for the   third quarter 2015  . Comparable sales, which are sales in stores that are open for at least 14 full months prior to the reporting period, including direct-to-consumer sales, decreased   8.2%   in the   third quarter 2016   compared to a   3.5%   decrease in the   third quarter 2015  . Direct-to-consumer sales contributed   0.3%   to the comparable sales rate in the   third quarter 2016   and   0.4%   in the   third quarter 2015  . The   8.2%   decrease in comparable sales reflects a decrease of 12.1% in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase of 4.4% in average transaction value. The decrease in transactions is primarily attributable to a decline in traffic in our stores. The growth in average transaction value was comprised of a 3.4% decline in average unit retail and an increase of 8.1% in units per transaction. Sales were negatively impacted by unseasonably warm weather and lower consumer demand, especially in our stores in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico, which continued to be impacted by depressed oil prices, and in our markets near the Mexican border due to the weak Mexican peso. Comparable sales in these four states were down 9.4%, while comparable sales in the balance of our chain was down 6.8%.  
       
  Our best performing merchandise categories were home and cosmetics. Dresses and women s denim were the best performing apparel categories. Sales of our fall seasonal merchandise, which includes sweaters, outerwear, fleece and boots were lower than expected as a result of warmer temperatures in our markets. 
    
  Gross Profit 
    
  Gross profit for the   third quarter 2016   was   $56.6 million  , a decrease of   $19.5 million   or   25.6%  , from   $76.1 million   for the   third quarter 2015  . Gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased to   17.8%   for the   third quarter 2016   from   21.6%   for the   third quarter 2015  . The   3.8  % decrease in the gross profit rate reflects a   1.8  % increase in merchandise cost of sales rate and a   2  % increase in the buying, occupancy and distribution expenses rate. The increase in merchandise cost of sales rate is the result of additional markdowns to drive sales and clear inventories in the   third quarter 2016   compared to the   third quarter 2015  . The increase in the buying, occupancy and distribution expense rate is the result of deleverage from lower sales in the   third quarter 2016   compared to the   third quarter 2015  . 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  SG A expenses for the   third quarter 2016   decreased   $7.5 million   to   $84.6 million   from   $92.1 million   for the   third quarter 2015  .  The decrease in SG A expenses for   third quarter 2016   compared to the   third quarter 2015   is primarily due to lower payroll, advertising and incentive compensation expense. As a percent of sales, SG A expenses increased to   26.7%   for the   third quarter 2016   from   26.2%   for the   third quarter 2015   due to deleverage from lower sales.

Interest Expense 
    
  Net interest expense was   $1.4 million   for the   third quarter 2016  , compared to   $0.7 million   for the   third quarter 2015  . Interest expense is primarily comprised of interest on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, related letters of credit and commitment fees, amortization of debt issuance costs and interest on finance obligations. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in the average daily borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility for the   third quarter 2016   compared to the   third quarter 2015  . 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Our effective income tax rate for the   third quarter 2016   was   46.8%  , resulting in an estimated tax benefit of   $13.7 million  . This compares to income tax benefit of   $6.6 million   and effective tax rate of 39.2% for the   third quarter 2015  . We are currently estimating an annual net loss for fiscal year 2016 which causes permanent tax benefits that would normally reduce the effective tax rate to be reflected as an increased percentage of the net loss. 

Year-to-Date 2016 Compared to Year-to-Date 2015 
    
  The following table sets forth the results of operations for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages): 

Net Sales 
    
  Sales for the   year-to-date 2016   of   $988.3 million   decreased   $113.5 million  , or   10.3%  , from   $1,101.8 million   for the   year-to-date 2015  . Comparable sales, which are sales in stores that are open for at least 14 full months prior to the reporting period, including direct-to-consumer sales, decreased   8.9%   for the   year-to-date 2016   compared to a   1.3%   decrease for   year-to-date 2015  .  Direct-to-consumer sales contributed   0.2%   to the comparable sales rate in the   year-to-date 2016   and   0.4%   in the   year-to-date 2015  . The   8.9%   decrease in comparable sales reflects a decrease of 13.5% in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase of 5.3% in average transaction value. The decrease in transactions is primarily attributable to a decline in traffic in our stores. The growth in average transaction value was comprised of a 0.1% improvement in average unit retail and an increase of 5.2% in units per transaction. Sales were negatively impacted by lower consumer demand, especially in our stores in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico, which continued to be impacted by depressed oil prices, and in our markets near the Mexican border due to the weak Mexican peso. Comparable sales in these four states were down 11.3%, while comparable sales in the balance of our chain was down 6%.  
       
  Our best performing merchandise categories were home, cosmetics and men s. Activewear and women s denim were the best performing apparel categories.

Gross Profit 
    
  Gross profit for the   year-to-date 2016   was   $209.1 million  , a decrease of   $46.3 million  , or   18.1%  , compared to   $255.5 million   for the   year-to-date 2015  .  Gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased to   21.2%   for the   year-to-date 2016   from   23.2%   for the   year-to-date 2015  . The   2.0  % decrease in the gross profit rate reflects a   0.6  % increase in merchandise cost of sales rate and a   1.4  % increase in the buying, occupancy and distribution expenses rate. The increase in merchandise cost of sales rate is the result of additional markdowns to drive sales and clear inventories in the   year-to-date 2016   compared to the   year-to-date 2015  . The increase in the buying, occupancy and distribution expense rate is the result of deleverage from lower sales and higher depreciation related to strategic investments, partially offset by $8.2 million higher impairment charges recognized in the   year-to-date 2015   compared with the   year-to-date 2016  .   
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  SG A expenses for the   year-to-date 2016   decreased   $21.7 million   to   $260.1 million  , from   $281.8 million   for the   year-to-date 2015  . The decrease in SG A expenses is primarily due lower payroll, advertising, benefits and incentive compensation expense. As a percent of sales, SG A expenses increased to   26.3%   for the   year-to-date 2016   from   25.6%   for the   year-to-date 2015   due to deleverage from lower sales. 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Net interest expense was   $3.6 million   for the   year-to-date 2016   and   $2.0 million   for the   year-to-date 2015  . Interest expense is primarily comprised of interest on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (see  Liquidity and Capital Resources ), related letters of credit and commitment fees, amortization of debt issuance costs and interest on finance obligations. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in the average daily borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility for the   year-to-date 2016   as compared with the   year-to-date 2015  . 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Our effective income tax rate for the   year-to-date 2016   was   43.1%  , resulting in an estimated tax benefit of   $23.5 million  .  This compares to an income tax benefit of   $11.1 million   for the   year-to-date 2015   at an effective rate   39.2%  . We are currently estimating an annual net loss for fiscal year 2016 which causes permanent tax benefits that would normally reduce the effective tax rate to be reflected as an increased percentage of the net loss.

Seasonality and Inflation 
    
  Our business is seasonal and historically sales are lower during the first three quarters of the fiscal year (February through October) and higher during the last quarter of the fiscal year (November through January). The fourth quarter usually accounts for approximately 30% of our annual sales, with each of the other quarters accounting for approximately 22% to 24%.  Working capital requirements fluctuate during the year and generally reach their highest levels during the third and fourth quarters.  We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our liquidity is currently provided by (i) existing cash balances, (ii) operating cash flows, (iii) normal trade credit terms from our vendors and their factors and (iv) our Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary cash requirements are for seasonal inventory purchases, capital investments in our stores, direct-to-consumer business and information technology and the payment of our quarterly cash dividends. 
    
  While there can be no assurances, we believe that our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to cover working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the remainder of   2016   and the foreseeable future.  
    
  Key components of our cash flow are summarized below (in thousands): 

Operating Activities 
    
  During the   year-to-date 2016  , we generated   $5.3 million   in cash from operating activities. Net loss, adjusted for non-cash expenses, provided cash of approximately   $30.6 million  . Changes in operating assets and liabilities used net cash of approximately   $32.3 million  , which included increases of   $133.3 million   in merchandise inventories, primarily due to seasonal receipts, and   $18.5 million   in other assets, partially offset by an increase of   $119.5 million   in accounts payable and other liabilities primarily related to inventory purchases.  Additionally, cash flows from operating activities included construction allowances from landlords of   $7.0 million  , which funded a portion of the capital expenditures related to leasehold improvements in our new corporate office building and store leasehold improvements in relocated, expanded and remodeled stores.  
    
  During the   year-to-date 2015  , we used   $30.8 million   in cash from operating activities. Net loss, adjusted for non-cash expenses, provided cash of approximately   $50.7 million  . Changes in operating assets and liabilities used net cash of approximately   $83.7 million  , which included increases of   $175.8 million   in merchandise inventories, primarily due to seasonal receipts and strategic investments in cosmetics, and   $3.3 million   in other assets, partially offset by an increase of   $95.5 million   in accounts payable and other liabilities primarily related to inventory purchases.  Additionally, cash flows from operating activities included construction allowances from landlords of   $2.1 million  , which funded a portion of the capital expenditures related to store leasehold improvements in new, relocated, expanded and remodeled stores.

     Table of Contents  

Investing Activities 
    
  Capital expenditures were   $67.9 million   for the   year-to-date 2016   compared to   $69.2 million   for the   year-to-date 2015  . The decrease in capital expenditures in the   year-to-date 2016   compared to the   year-to-date 2015   is due to a decrease in store expansions and remodels. We received construction allowances from landlords of   $7.0 million   in the   year-to-date 2016   and   $2.1 million   in the   year-to-date 2015   to fund a portion of the capital expenditures related to store leasehold improvements and our new corporate office building. These funds are recorded as a deferred rent credit on the balance sheet and are recognized as an offset to rent expense over the lease term commencing with the date the allowances are earned. 
    
  We estimate that capital expenditures in 2016, net of construction allowances from landlords, will be approximately $65 million as compared to $87 million for 2015. The expenditures are principally for store remodels, expansions and relocations, and investments in our technology and direct-to-consumer business. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  We use the Revolving Credit Facility to provide financing for working capital and general corporate purposes, as well as to finance capital expenditures and to support our letter of credit requirements. Borrowings are limited to the availability under a borrowing base that is determined principally on eligible inventory as defined by the Revolving Credit Facility agreement. Inventory, cash and cash equivalents are pledged as collateral. The daily interest rates are determined by a prime rate or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin, as set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement. For the   year-to-date 2016  , the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings and the average daily borrowings were   1.83%   and   $188.0 million  , respectively, compared to   1.50%   and   $80.2 million     year-to-date 2015  .  The increase in average daily borrowings for the   year-to-date 2016   compared to the   year-to-date 2015   is primarily due to stock repurchases made in the fourth quarter 2015 and capital expenditures. 
    
  Letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility support certain merchandise purchases and collateralize retained risks and deductibles under various insurance programs. At   October 29, 2016  , outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately   $5.7 million  . These letters of credit expire within twelve months of issuance. Excess borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility at   October 29, 2016   was   $112.2 million  . 
    
  The Revolving Credit Facility agreement contains covenants which, among other things, restrict, based on required levels of excess availability, (i) the amount of additional debt or capital lease obligations, (ii) the payment of dividends to $30.0 million in a fiscal year, and (iii) the repurchase of common stock under certain circumstances. The agreement also contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in the event excess availability is below a defined threshold or an event of default has occurred. At   October 29, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of the debt covenants of the agreement and we expect to remain in compliance. 
    
  During the   year-to-date 2016  , we borrowed approximately   $5.8 million   under an equipment financing note bearing an effective interest rate of   3.2%  . The equipment financing note is payable in monthly installments over a three-year term and is secured by certain equipment.  
    
  We paid   $12.5 million   in cash dividends during the   year-to-date 2016  . On   November 17, 2016  , our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.15   per share of common stock, payable on   December 14, 2016   to shareholders of record at the close of business on   November 29, 2016  .

ITEM 2.                                            UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
  On March 7, 2011, our Board approved a stock repurchase program ( 2011 Stock Repurchase Program ) which authorized us to repurchase up to   $200.0 million   of our outstanding common stock. The 2011 Stock Repurchase Program will expire when we have repurchased   $200.0 million   of our outstanding common stock, unless terminated earlier by our Board. Through January 30, 2016, we repurchased approximately $141.6 million of our outstanding common shares under the 2011 Stock Repurchase Program.  Also in March 2011, our Board authorized us to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock equal to the amount of the proceeds and related tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) and other equity grants. Purchases of shares of our common stock may be made from time to time, either on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are financed by our existing cash, cash flow and other liquidity sources, as appropriate. 
    
  The table below sets forth information regarding our repurchases of common stock during the   three months ended     October 29, 2016  : 

(a)    Although we did not repurchase any of our common stock during the   three months ended     October 29, 2016   under the 2011 Stock Repurchase Program: 
             
    We reacquired 2,462 shares of common stock from certain employees to cover tax withholding obligations from the vesting of restricted and performance stock at a weighted average acquisition price of $5.80 per common share; and 
                
    The trustee of the grantor trust established by us for the purpose of holding assets under our deferred compensation plan purchased an aggregate of 10,590 shares of our common stock in the open market at a weighted average price of $5.47 in connection with the option to invest in our stock under the deferred compensation plan and reinvestment of dividends paid on our common stock held in trust in the deferred compensation plan. 
      (b)    Reflects the   $200.0 million   authorized under the 2011 Stock Purchase Program, less the $141.6 million repurchased using our existing cash, cash flow and other liquidity sources since March 2011.

  1.1        Business Office  .    The principal office of the corporation shall be located at any place either within or outside the State of Nevada as designated in the corporation s most recent document on file with the Nevada Secretary of State.  The corporation may have such other offices, either within or without the State of Nevada, as the board of directors may designate or as the business of the corporation may require from time to time. 
  1.2        Registered Office  .    The registered office of the corporation shall be located within the State of Nevada and may be, but need not be, identical with the principal office.  The address of the registered office may be changed from time to time. 
  ARTICLE 2. SHAREHOLDERS 
  2.1        Annual Shareholder Meeting  .    An annual meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting shall be held at the time, date and place, within or outside the State of Nevada, designated by the board of directors and stated in the meeting notice.  If the day fixed for the annual meeting is a legal holiday in the State of Nevada, the meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day. 
  2.2        Special Shareholder Meeting  .    Special meetings of the shareholders, for any purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, may be called by the president, or by the board of directors, and shall be called by the president at the request of the holders of not less than one fourth of all outstanding votes of the corporation entitled to be cast on any issue at the meeting. 
  2.3        Place of Shareholder Meeting  .    The board of directors may designate any place, either within or without the State of Nevada, as the place of meeting for any annual or any special meeting of the shareholders.   
  2.4        Notice of Shareholder Meeting  .    Written notice stating the date, time, and place of any annual or special shareholder meeting shall be delivered not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the President, the board of directors, or other persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting and to any other shareholder entitled by the Nevada Revised Statues (the  Statutes ) or the corporation s Articles of Incorporation to receive notice of the meeting.  Notice shall be deemed to be effective at the earlier of: (1) when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid; or (2) on the date shown on the return receipt if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and the receipt is  

signed by or on behalf of the addressee; or (3) when received; or (4) three (3) days after deposit in the United States mail, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed to an address other than that shown in the corporation s current record of shareholders. 
  If any shareholder meeting is adjourned to a different date, time or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time and place, if the new date, time and place is announced at the meeting before adjournment.  But if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or if a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed, then notice must be given pursuant to the requirements of the previous paragraph, to those persons who are shareholders as of the new record date. 
  2.5        Waiver of Notice  .    A shareholder may waive any notice required by the Statutes, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, by a writing signed by the shareholder entitled to the notice, which is delivered to the corporation (either before or after the date and time stated in the notice) for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. 
  A shareholder s attendance at a meeting: 
  (a)        waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting because of lack of notice or effective notice; and 
  (b)        waives objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented. 
  2.6        Fixing of Record Date  .    For the purpose of determining shareholders of any voting group entitled to notice of, or to vote at, any meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any distribution, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other purpose, the board of directors may fix in advance a date as the record date.  The record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such determination of shareholders is to be taken.  If no record date is so fixed by the board for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting of shareholders, the record date for determination of those shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day the first notice is delivered to shareholders.  If no record date is fixed by the board for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive a distribution, the record date shall be the date the board authorizes the distribution.  With respect to actions taken in writing without a meeting, the record date shall be the date the first shareholder signs the consent. 
  When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this Section, that determination shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the board of directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date fixed for the original meeting. 
  2.7        Shareholder List  .    After fixing a record date for a shareholder meeting, the corporation shall prepare a list of the names of its shareholders entitled to be given notice of the meeting.  The shareholder list must be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning on  
  
   2 

the earlier of ten (10) days before the meeting for which the list was prepared or two (2) business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, and any adjournment of the meeting.  The list shall be available at the corporation s principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting is to be held. 
  2.8        Shareholder Quorum and Voting Requirements  . 
  2.8.1        Quorum  .    Except as otherwise required by the Statutes or the Articles of Incorporation, a majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation, represented by person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at each meeting of the shareholders.  If a quorum exists, action on a matter, other than the election of directors, is approved if the votes cast favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Articles of Incorporation or the Statutes require a greater number of affirmative votes. 
  2.8.2        Voting of Shares  .    Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, each outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote upon each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders. 
  2.9        Quorum and Voting Requirements of Voting Groups  .    If the Articles of Incorporation or the Statutes provide for voting by a single voting group on a matter, action on that matter is taken when voted upon by that voting group. 
  Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of the meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting. 
  Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those shares exists with respect to that matter.  Unless the Articles of Incorporation or the Statutes provide otherwise, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. 
  If the Articles of Incorporation or the Statutes provide for voting by two or more voting groups on a matter, action on that matter is taken only when voted upon by each of those voting groups counted separately.  Action may be taken by one voting group on a matter even though no action is taken by another voting group entitled to vote on the matter. 
  If a quorum exists, action on a matter, other than the election of directors, by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Articles of Incorporation or the Statutes require a greater number of affirmative votes. 
  2.10        Greater Quorum or Voting Requirements  .    The Articles of Incorporation may provide for a greater quorum or voting requirement for shareholders, or voting groups of shareholders, than is provided for by these Bylaws.  An amendment to the Articles of Incorporation that adds, changes, or deletes a greater quorum or voting requirement for shareholders must meet the same quorum requirement and be adopted by the same vote and voting groups required to take  
  
   3 

action under the quorum and voting requirement then in effect or proposed to be adopted, whichever is greater. 
  2.11        Proxies  .    At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote in person or by proxy which is executed in writing by the shareholder or which is executed by his duly authorized attorney in fact.  The proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation or other person authorized to tabulate votes before or at the time of the meeting.  No proxy shall be valid after six (6) months from the date of its creation unless (i) it is coupled with an interest; or (ii) the shareholder specifies in the proxy the length of time for which the proxy will continue in force; provided that, the proxy may not exceed 7 years from the date of its creation.  All proxies are revocable unless they meet specific requirements of irrevocability set forth in the Statutes.  The death or incapacity of a voter does not invalidate a proxy unless the corporation is put on notice.  A transferee for value who receives shares subject to an irrevocable proxy, can revoke the proxy if he had no notice of the proxy. 
  2.12        Corporation s Acceptance of Votes  . 
  2.12.1        If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment, or proxy appointment revocation corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the corporation, if acting in good faith, is entitled to accept the vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment, or proxy appointment revocation and give it effect as the act of the shareholder. 
  2.12.2        If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment, or proxy appointment revocation does not correspond to the name of a shareholder, the corporation, if acting in good faith, is nevertheless entitled to accept the vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment, or proxy appointment revocation and give it effect as the act of the shareholder if: 
  (a)        the shareholder is an entity as defined in the Statutes and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity; 
  (b)        the name signed purports to be that of an administrator, executor, guardian, or conservator representing the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the vote, consent, wavier, proxy appointment or proxy appointment revocation; 
  (c)        the name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment, or proxy appointment revocation; or 
  (d)        the name signed purports to be that of a pledgee, beneficial owner, or attorney in fact of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the signatory s authority to sign for the shareholder has been presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment or proxy appointment revocation; or 
  
   4 

(e)        two or more persons are the shareholder as co tenants or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the co owners and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all co tenants or fiduciaries. 
  2.12.3        If shares are registered in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, co tenants, husband and wife as community property, voting trustees, persons entitled to vote under a shareholder voting agreement or otherwise, or if two or more persons (including proxy holders) have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the secretary of the corporation or other officer or agent entitled to tabulate votes is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: 
  (a)        if only one votes, such act binds all; 
  (b)        if more than one votes, the act of the majority so voting bind all; 
  (c)        if more than one votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each fraction may vote the securities in question proportionately. 
  If the instrument so filed or the registration of the shares shows that any tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even split for the purpose of this Section shall be a majority or even split in interest. 
  2.12.4        The corporation is entitled to reject a vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment or proxy appointment revocation if the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory s authority to sign for the shareholder. 
  2.12.5        The corporation and its officer or agent who accepts or rejects a vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment or proxy appointment revocation in good faith and in accordance with the standards of this Section are not liable in damages to the shareholder for the consequences of the acceptance or rejection. 
  2.12.6         Corporate action based on the acceptance or rejection of a vote, consent, waiver, proxy appointment or proxy appointment revocation under this Section is valid unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise. 
  2.13        Action by Shareholders Without a Meeting  . 
  2.13.1        Written Consent  .    Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice if one or more consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof were present and voted.  Action taken under  
  
   5 

this Section has the same effect as action taken at a duly called and convened meeting of shareholders and may be described as such in any document. 
  2.13.2    Effective Date and Revocation of Consents  .    No action taken pursuant to this Section shall be effective unless all written consents necessary to support the action are received by the corporation within a sixty day period and not revoked.  Such action is effective as of the date the last written consent is received necessary to effect the action, unless all of the written consents specify an earlier or later date of the action.  Any shareholder giving a written consent pursuant to this Section may revoke the consent by a signed writing describing the action and stating that the consent is revoked, provided that the writing is received by the corporation prior to the effective date of the action. 
  2.13.3   Unanimous Consent for Election of Directors  .    Notwithstanding subsection (a), directors may not be elected by written consent unless such consent is unanimous by all shares entitled to vote for the election of directors. 
  2.14        Voting for Directors  .    Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, every shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors has the right to cast, in person or by proxy, all of the votes to which the shareholder s shares are entitled for as many persons as there are directors to be elected and for whose election such shareholder has the right to vote.  At each meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, a director nominee shall be elected to the board of directors if the votes properly cast for such nominee s election exceed the votes properly cast against such nominee s election; provided, however, that the nominees receiving a plurality of the votes properly cast shall be elected to the board of directors at any such meeting of the shareholders at which the number of nominees for election exceeds the number of directors to be elected. 
  ARTICLE 3. BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
  3.1        General Powers  .    Unless the Articles of Incorporation have dispensed with or limited the authority of the board of directors by describing who will perform some or all of the duties of a board of directors, all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority, and the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed under the direction, of the board of directors. 
  3.2        Number, Tenure and Qualification of Directors  .    The authorized number of directors shall be eleven (11); provided, however, that if the corporation has less than two (2) shareholders entitled to vote for the election of directors, the board of directors may consist of a number of individuals equal to or greater than the number of those shareholders and in any case the corporation shall have at least one (1) director.  The current number of directors shall be within the limit specified above, as determined (or as amended from time to time) by a resolution adopted by either the shareholders or the directors.   The term of office for each director shall be one year.  A director shall hold office to the end of his elected term or until the director s earlier death, resignation, or removal.  However, if his term expires, he shall continue to serve until his successor shall have been elected and qualified, or until there is a decrease in the number of directors.  Directors do not need to be residents of Nevada or shareholders of the corporation. 
  
   6 

3.3        Regular Meetings of the Board of Directors  .    A regular meeting of the board of directors shall be held without other notice than this Bylaw immediately after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders, for the purpose of appointing officers and transacting such other business as may come before the meeting.  The board of directors may provide, by resolution, the time and place for the holding of additional regular meetings without other notice than such resolution. 
  3.4        Special Meetings of the Board of Directors  .    Special meetings of the board of directors may be called by or at the request of the president or any director.  The person authorized to call special meetings of the board of directors may fix any place as the place for holding any special meeting of the board of directors. 
  3.5        Notice of, and Waiver of Notice for, Special Director Meeting  .    Unless the Articles of Incorporation provide for a longer or shorter period, notice of the date, time, and place of any special director meeting shall be given at least two days before the meeting either orally or in writing.  Any director may waive notice of any meeting.  Except as provided in the next sentence, the waiver must be in writing and signed by the director entitled to the notice.  The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business and at the beginning of the meeting (or promptly upon his arrival) objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.  Unless required by the Articles of Incorporation, neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any special meeting of the board of directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of the meeting. 
  3.6        Director Quorum and Voting  . 
  3.6.1        Quorum  .    A majority of the number of directors prescribed by resolution shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors unless the Articles of Incorporation require a greater percentage. 
  Unless the Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise, any or all directors may participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through the use of, any means of communication by which all directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting.  A director participating in a meeting by this means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting. 
  A director who is present at a meeting of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors when corporate action is taken is deemed to have assented to the action taken unless: (1) the director objects at the beginning of the meeting (or promptly upon his arrival) to holding or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to any action taken at the meeting; and (2) the director contemporaneously requests his dissent or abstention as to any specific action be entered in the minutes of the meeting; or (3) the director causes written notice of his dissent or abstention as to any specific action be received by the presiding officer of the meeting before its adjournment or to the corporation immediately after adjournment of the meeting.  The right of dissent or abstention is not available to a director who votes in favor of the action taken. 
  
   7 

3.7        Director Action Without a Meeting  .    Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if all the directors consent to such action in writing.  Action taken by consent is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless, prior to that time, any director has revoked a consent by a signed writing received by the corporation, or unless the consent specifies a different effective date.  A signed consent has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document. 
  3.8        Resignation of Directors  .    A director may resign at any time by giving a written notice of resignation to the corporation.  The resignation is effective when the notice is received by the corporation, unless the notice specifies a later effective date. 
  3.9        Removal of Directors  .    The shareholders may remove one or more directors at a meeting called for that purpose if notice has been given that a purpose of the meeting is such removal.  The removal may be with or without cause unless the Articles of Incorporation provide that directors may only be removed with cause.  If a director is elected by a voting group of shareholders, only the shareholders of that voting group may participate in the vote to remove him.  A director may be removed only if the number of votes cast to remove him is at least two thirds (2/3) of the voting power of the issued and outstanding stock. 
  3.10        Board of Directors Vacancies  .    Unless the Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise, if a vacancy occurs on the board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors, the shareholders may fill the vacancy.  During the time that the shareholders fail or are unable to fill such vacancies, then and until the shareholders act: 
  (a)        the board of directors may fill the vacancy; or 
  (b)        if the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the board, they may fill the vacancy by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the directors remaining in office. 
  If the vacant office was held by a director elected by a voting group of shareholders: 
  (a)        if there are one or more directors elected by the same voting group, only those directors are entitled to vote to fill the vacancy if it is filled by the directors; and  
  (b)        only the holders of shares of that voting group are entitled to vote to fill the vacancy if it is filled by the shareholders. 
  A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date (by reason of a resignation effective at a later date) may be filled before the vacancy occurs but the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs. 
  3.11        Director Compensation  .    By resolution of the board of directors, each director may be paid his expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the board of directors and may be paid a stated salary as director or a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the board of directors or both.  No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. 
  
   8 

3.12        Director Committees  . 
  3.12.1        Creation of Committees  .    Unless the Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise, the board of directors may create one or more committees and appoint members of the board of directors to serve on them.  Each committee must have one or more members, who shall serve at the pleasure of the board of directors. 
  3.12.2        Selection of Members  .    The creation of a committee and appointment of members to it must be approved by the greater of (1) a majority of all the directors in office when the action is taken or (2) the number of directors required by the Articles of Incorporation to take such action. 
  3.12.3        Required Procedures  .    Those Sections of this Article 3 which govern meetings, actions without meetings, notice and waiver of notice, quorum and voting requirements of the board of directors, apply to committees and their members. 
  3.12.4        Authority  .    Unless limited by the Articles of Incorporation, each committee may exercise those aspects of the authority of the board of directors which the board of directors confers upon such committee in the resolution creating the committee.  Provided, however, a committee may not: 
  (a)        authorize distributions; 
  (b)        approve or propose to shareholders action that the Statutes require be approved by shareholders; 
  (c)        fill vacancies on the board of directors or on any of its committees;

  3.13        Acquisition of Controlling Interest  .    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Bylaws and to the extent not inconsistent with the corporation's Articles of Incorporation, the board of directors may impose stricter requirements on the acquisition of a controlling interest in the corporation than the provisions of the laws of the State of Nevada (currently Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes) regarding the acquisition of a controlling interest in the corporation  
  
   9 

or any other action deemed by the board of directors to be an attempt to gain control of the corporation.  Furthermore, any election to be governed by Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes or other applicable law of the State of Nevada shall not restrict the board of directors from taking any action to protect the interests of the corporation and its shareholders including, but not limited to, adopting or executing plans, arrangements or instruments that deny rights, privileges, power or authority to a holder of a specified number of shares or percentage of share ownership or voting power. 
  In the event at any time the corporation does not meet the statutory criteria to be an  issuing corporation  and obtain the benefits of the Nevada Revised Statutes with respect to the acquisition of a controlling interest, the provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes with respect to the acquisition of a controlling interest are fully adopted as if the corporation was an  issuing corporation. 
  ARTICLE 4. OFFICERS

  4.3        Removal of Officers  .    Any officer or agent may be removed by the board of directors at any time, with or without cause.  Such removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed.  Appointment of an officer or agent shall not of itself create contract rights.

  4.6        Vice Presidents  .    If appointed, in the absence of the president or in the event of his death, inability or refusal to act, the vice president (or in the event there be more than one vice president, the vice presidents in the order designate at the time of their election, or in the absence of any designation, then in the order of their appointment) shall perform the duties of the president, and when so acting, shall have all the powers of, and be subject to, all the restrictions upon the president.

The Corporation (as defined in Section 5.13 below), to the full extent and in a manner permitted by Nevada law as in effect from time to time, shall indemnify, in accordance with the provisions of this Article, any person (including the heirs, executors, administrators or estate of any such person) who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (including any appeal thereof), whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation or by any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which the Corporation owns, directly or indirectly through one or more other entities, a majority of the voting power or otherwise possesses a similar degree of control), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer, of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, member, manager, partner, trustee or fiduciary (a  Subsidiary Officer ) of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise (any such entity for which a Subsidiary Officer so serves, an  Associated Entity ), against expenses, including attorneys  fees and disbursements, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person is not liable pursuant to Section 78.138 of the Statutes, or acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful;   provided, however  , that (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify a person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of an Associated Entity against expenses incurred in connection with an action, suit, proceeding or investigation to which such person is threatened to be made a party but does not become a party unless the incurring of such expenses was authorized by or under the authority of the Board of Directors (as defined in Section 5.13 below) and (ii) the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify against any amount paid in settlement unless the Board of Directors has consented to such settlement.  The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction or upon a plea of   nolo     contendere   or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person (i) is liable pursuant to Section 78.138 of the Statutes or (ii) did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that such person had reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.1 against costs or expenses incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding commenced by such person against the Corporation or any Associated Entity or any person who is or was a director, officer or fiduciary of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of any Associated Entity (including, without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding commenced by such person to enforce such person s rights under this Article, unless and only to the extent that such person is successful on the merits of such claim), but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in a specific case as permitted by Section 5.7 below. 
  5.2        Indemnification Respecting Derivative Claims  .    The Corporation, to the full extent and in a manner permitted by Nevada law as in effect from time to time, shall indemnify, in accordance with the provisions of this Article, any person (including the heirs, executors,  
  
   12 

administrators or estate of any such person) who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit (including any appeal thereof) brought in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving as a Subsidiary Officer of an Associated Entity, against expenses (including attorneys  fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person is not liable pursuant to Section 78.138 of the Statutes, or acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom to be liable to the Corporation unless, and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses and costs as a court of competent jurisdiction or such other court shall deem proper;   provided, however  , that the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify a director or officer of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of an Associated Entity against expenses incurred in connection with an action or suit to which such person is threatened to be made a party but does not become a party unless the incurrence of such expenses was authorized by or under the authority of the Board of Directors.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.2, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.2 against costs and expenses incurred in connection with any action or suit in the right of the Corporation commenced by such person, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in any specific case as permitted by Section 5.7 below. 
  5.3        Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification  .    Any indemnification to be provided under either of Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above (unless ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or advanced as provided in Section 5.5 below) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper under the circumstances. Such determination must be made (i) by a majority vote of a quorum of shareholder, (ii) by the Board of Directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding, (iii) if a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding so orders, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) if a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding cannot be obtained, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.  In the event a request for indemnification is made by any person referred to in Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, the Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such determination to be made not later than sixty (60) days after such request is made after the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding. 
  5.4        Right to Indemnification upon Successful Defense and for Service as a Witness  . 
  5.4.1        Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, to the extent that a present or former director or officer has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in either of Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against  
  
   13 

expenses (including attorneys  fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith without the necessity of the determination described in Section 5.3 above. 
  5.4.2        To the extent any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of an Associated Entity has served or prepared to serve as a witness in, but is not a party to, any action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative in nature), including any investigation by any legislative or regulatory body or by any securities or commodities exchange of which the Corporation or an Associated Entity is a member or to the jurisdiction of which it is subject, by reason of their services as a director or officer of the Corporation, or their service as a Subsidiary Officer of an Associated Entity (assuming such person is or was serving as a Subsidiary Officer of such Associated Entity), the Corporation may indemnify such person against expenses (including attorneys  fees and disbursements) and out-of-pocket costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith and, if the Corporation has determined to so indemnify such person, shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide such indemnity within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Corporation from such person of a statement requesting such indemnification, averring such service and reasonably evidencing such expenses and costs; it being understood, however, that the Corporation shall have no obligation under this Article to compensate such person for such person s time or efforts so expended. 
  5.5        Advance of Expenses  . 
  5.5.1        Expenses and costs incurred by any present or former director or officer of the Corporation  in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall, to the extent permitted by law, be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking in writing by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized by this Article. 
  5.5.2        Expenses and costs incurred by any other person referred to in Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above in defending a civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by or under the authority of the Board of Directors upon receipt of an undertaking in writing by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation in respect of such costs and expenses as authorized by this Article and subject to any limitations or qualifications provided by or under the authority of the Board of Directors. 
  5.6        Notice of Action; Assumption of the Defense  .    Promptly after receipt by any person referred to in Sections 5.1, 5.2 or 5.5 above of notice of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or advancement of expenses may be sought under any such Section, such person (the  Indemnitee ) shall notify the Corporation thereof. The Corporation shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such action, suit or proceeding and, to the extent that it may wish, except in the case of a criminal action or proceeding, to assume  
  
   14 

the defense thereof with counsel chosen by it. If the Corporation shall have notified the Indemnitee of its election so to assume the defense, it shall be a condition of any further obligation of the Corporation under such Sections to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to such action, suit or proceeding that the Indemnitee shall have provided an undertaking in writing to repay all legal or other costs and expenses subsequently incurred by the Corporation in conducting such defense if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified in respect of the costs and expenses of such action, suit or proceeding by the Corporation as authorized by this Article or under separate agreement as authorized by Section 5.7 below. Notwithstanding anything in this Article to the contrary, after the Corporation shall have notified the Indemnitee of its election so to assume the defense, the Corporation shall not be liable under such Sections for any legal or other costs or expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such action, suit or proceeding, unless (a) the parties thereto include both (i) the Corporation and the Indemnitee, or (ii) the Indemnitee and other persons who may be entitled to seek indemnification or advancement of expenses under any such Section and with respect to whom the Corporation shall have elected to assume the defense, and (b) the counsel chosen by the Corporation to conduct the defense shall have determined, in their sole discretion, that, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict of interest exists that would prevent them from representing both (i) the Corporation and the Indemnitee, or (ii) the Indemnitee and such other persons, as the case may be, in which case the Indemnitee may retain separate counsel at the expense of the Corporation to the extent provided in such Sections and Section 5.3 above. 
  5.7        Indemnification Not Exclusive  .    The provision of indemnification to or the advancement of expenses and costs to any person under this Article, or the entitlement of any person to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under this Article does not exclude any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the articles of incorporation or any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, for either an action in such person s official capacity or an action in another capacity while holding such person s office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 above shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
  5.8        Corporate Obligations; Reliance  .    The provisions of Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.4.1 and 5.5.1 above shall be deemed to create a binding obligation on the part of the Corporation to the directors and officers of the Corporation, and the persons who are serving as Subsidiary Officers of Associated Entities, on the effective date of this Article and persons thereafter elected as directors and officers of the Corporation, or serving as Subsidiary Officers of Associated Entities (including persons who served as directors or officers of the Corporation or served as Subsidiary Officers of Associated Entities on or after such date but who are no longer so serving at the time they present claims for advancement of expenses or indemnity), and such persons in acting in their capacities as directors or officers of the Corporation, or serving as Subsidiary Officers of any Associated Entity, shall be entitled to rely on such provisions of this Article. 
  5.9        Further Changes  .    Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article, nor the adoption of any provision of the Articles of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of such provisions in respect of any act or omission or any matter occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision regardless of when any cause of action, suit or claim relating to any such matter accrued or matured or was  
  
   15 

commenced, and such provision shall continue to have effect in respect of such act, omission or matter as if such provision had not been so amended or repealed or if a provision inconsistent therewith had not been so adopted. 
  5.10        Successors  .    The right, if any, of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving as a Subsidiary Officer of an Associated Entity, to indemnification or advancement of expenses under Sections 5.1 through 5.9 above shall continue after such person shall have ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of an Associated Entity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, distributees, executors, administrators and other legal representatives of such person.

  5.11.3        Any insurance or other financial arrangement made on behalf of a person pursuant to this section may be provided by the Corporation or any other person approved by the Board of Directors, even if all or part of the other person s stock or other securities is owned by the Corporation. 
  5.11.4        In the absence of fraud:  (a) the decision of the Board of Directors as to the propriety of the terms and conditions of any insurance or other financial arrangement made pursuant to this Section and the choice of the person to provide the insurance or other financial arrangement is conclusive; and (b) the insurance or other financial arrangement (i) is not void or voidable, and (ii) does not subject any director approving it to personal liability for his action, even if, in either case, a director approving the insurance or other financial arrangement is a beneficiary of the insurance or other financial arrangement. 
  5.12        Indemnification of Employees and Agents  .    The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation and Associated Entities similar to those conferred in this Article to directors and officers of the Corporation.

Any benefits described in Section 4.6.1(iv) shall be provided in accordance with the terms of the applicable plans and in compliance with COBRA regulations. The payments described in Section 4.6.1(v) shall be paid directly to the entity providing outplacement services to the Executive within ten (10) days of receipt of an invoice or statement from such entity.  The reimbursement of the expenses related to Section 4.6.1(vi) shall be made to the Executive in accordance with the Company s or its successor s policies and procedures. 
  4.6.3  Change in Control Defined  .     For purposes of this Agreement, a  Change in Control  shall be deemed to have occurred: 
  (a)  on such date, within the 12-month period following the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as defined in  1.409A 3(i)(5)(v)(B) of the Treasury Regulations), acquires ownership of stock that represents twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company s then outstanding securities (the  Trigger Date ), that a majority of the individuals who, as of the Trigger Date, constitute the Board (the  Incumbent Board ) are replaced by new members whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Incumbent Board before the date of such appointment or election; 
  (b)  as of the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as defined in  1.409A-3(i)(5)(v)(B) of the Treasury Regulations), acquires ownership of stock that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50% of either (1) the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company or (2) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; provided, however, if any one person or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons shall not be considered to cause a Change in Control; or 
  
    10 

(c)  the date any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as defined in  1.409A-3(i)(5)(v)(B) of the Treasury Regulations), acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company, except for any sale, lease exchange or transfer resulting from any action taken by any creditor of the Company in enforcing its rights or remedies against any assets of the Company in which such creditor holds a security interest.  Provided further, a transfer of assets by the Company shall not be treated as a Change in Control if the assets are transferred to: 
    
  (i)    A shareholder of the Company (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange for or with respect to its stock; 
    
  (ii)    An entity, 50% or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company; 
    
  (iii)    A person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the Company; or 
    
  (iv)    An entity, at least 50% of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in paragraph (iii) herein. 
    
  For purposes of subsection (c) and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (i), a person s status is determined immediately after the transfer of the assets. 
  4.6.4  Application of Golden Parachute Limits  .  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the Company or its successor to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (a  Payment ), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (such excise tax, together with any interest thereon, any penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts with respect to such excise tax, and any interest in respect of such penalties, additions to tax or additional amounts, being collectively referred herein to as the  Excise Tax ), then if the aggregate of all Payments that would be subject to the Excise Tax, reduced by all Federal, state and local taxes applicable thereto, including the Excise Tax is less than the amount Executive would receive, after all such applicable taxes, if Executive received Payments equal to an amount which is $1.00 less than three times the Executive s  base amount , as defined in and determined under Section 280G of the Code, then, such Payments shall be reduced or eliminated to the extent necessary so that the aggregate Payments received by Executive will not be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in the Payments is necessary, reduction shall occur in the following order: first, a reduction of cash payments not attributable to equity awards which vest in an accelerated basis; second, a reduction in any other cash amount payable to Executive; third, the reduction of any employee benefit valued  
  
    11 

as a  parachute payment  (as defined in Section 280G of the Code); and fourth, the cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock awards. If acceleration of vesting of stock award compensation is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant of Executive s stock awards.  All determinations made under this Section 4.6.4 and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determinations shall be made by a registered public accounting firm designated by Executive and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the  Accounting Firm ). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company or its successor. 
  4.7  Execution of Release by the Executive  .    Except for payment of earned and unpaid Base Salary, unused and accrued vacation, unreimbursed business expenses due under Section 3.6 and any other benefits due under Section 3.3 or otherwise through the date of the Executive s termination, the Company shall not be obligated to pay any portion of the monies and benefits described above, if any, unless the Executive shall have executed and delivered to the Company a release of any and all claims or causes of action against the Company and its Subsidiaries and successors and their respective shareholders, partners, member, directors, managers, officers, employees, agents and attorneys, arising out of or related to any act or omission which occurred on or prior to the date on which the Executive s employment was terminated, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company within 60 days of the Executive s date of termination.  Such release shall also include other provisions including non disparagement and confidentiality by the Executive, litigation assistance and a no rehire agreement. 
  4.8  Section 409A  .    This Agreement is intended to comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and related U.S. Treasury regulations or pronouncements ( Section 409A ) and any ambiguous provision will be construed in a manner that is compliant with or exempt from the application of Section 409A.  Any reference to an Executive s termination of employment shall mean a cessation of the employment relationship between the Executive and the Company which constitutes a  separation from service  as determined in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Executive is deemed on his date of termination to be a  specified employee  within the meaning of that term under Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, then the payments and benefits under this Agreement that are subject to Section 409A and paid by reason of a termination of employment shall be made or provided (subject to the last sentence hereof) on the later of (A) the payment date set forth in this Agreement, or (B) the date that is the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of the Executive s termination of employment or (ii) the date of the Executive s death, if applicable (the  Delay Period ).  Payments subject to the Delay Period shall be paid to the Executive without interest for such delay in payment. 
  4.9  Conditions of Reimbursement  .  With respect to any reimbursement of expenses of, or any provision of in-kind benefits to, the Executive, as specified under this Agreement, such reimbursement of expenses or provision of in-kind benefits shall be subject to the following conditions: (1) the expenses eligible for reimbursement or the amount of in kind benefits provided in one taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or the amount of in-kind benefits provided in any other taxable  
  
    12 

year, except for any medical reimbursement arrangement providing for the reimbursement of expenses referred to in Section 105(b) of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) the reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made no later than the end of the year after the year in which such expense was incurred; and (3) the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 
  5.  POST-EMPLOYMENT DUTIES  .    For a period of two (2) years following the termination of this Agreement, the Executive shall: (i) fully and truthfully cooperate and assist the Company and its Subsidiaries or successors, to the fullest extent possible, in any and all issues, matters, legal proceedings or litigation related to or associated with the business, management or operation of or any other matter involving the Company or its subsidiaries or successors in any way or of any nature whatsoever arising from, related to or connected with any period in which the Executive was employed by or otherwise provided services to the Company or its Subsidiaries or successors or in which the Executive has or may have past knowledge, information or experience or applicable expertise, and (ii) fully cooperate, assist, participate and work with the Company or its Subsidiaries or successors on any and all issues or matters for which the Company or its Subsidiaries or successors may seek the Executive s cooperation, assistance, participation, involvement or consultation.  Such assistance shall be provided at such times and dates which shall not unreasonably interfere or conflict with the Executive s then current employment.  The Company or its successor shall reimburse the Executive for any and all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Executive in providing such assistance in accordance with the standard policies and procedures of the Company or its successor in effect from time to time related to such reimbursable expenses. 
  6.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  .    The Company agrees that during the course of and in connection with the Executive s employment with the Company, the Company will provide and the Executive agrees to accept access to and knowledge of Confidential Information (as hereafter defined). Confidential Information may include but is not limited to business decisions, plans, procedures, strategies and policies, legal matters affecting the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, personnel, customer records information, trade secrets, bid prices, evaluations of bids, contractual terms and arrangements (prospective purchases and sales), pricing strategies, financial and business forecasts and plans and other information affecting the value or sales of products, goods, services or securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and personal information regarding employees (collectively, the  Confidential Information ). The Executive acknowledges and agrees the Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company or such subsidiary.  The Executive shall not disclose to any unauthorized person, or use for the Executive s own purposes, any Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Board, which consent may be withheld by the Board at its sole discretion, unless and to the extent that the aforementioned matters become generally known to and available for use by the public other than as a result of the Executive s acts or omissions.  The Executive agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information after the termination of the Executive s employment; provided, further, that if at any time the Executive or any person or entity to which the Executive has disclosed any Confidential Information becomes legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Executive shall provide the Company with prompt, prior written notice of such requirement so the Company, in its sole discretion, may seek a protective order or other  
  
    13 

appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms hereof.  In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the Executive shall ensure that only the portion of the Confidential Information which the Executive or such person is advised by written opinion of the Company s counsel that the Executive is legally required to disclose is disclosed, and the Executive further covenants and agrees to exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that the recipient of such Confidential Information shall not further disclose such Confidential Information to others, except as required by law, following such disclosure.  In addition the Executive covenants and agrees to deliver to the Company upon termination of this Agreement, and at any other time as the Company may request, any and all property of the Company including, but not limited to, keys, computers, credit cards, company car, memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, computer tapes, printouts and software, Confidential Information in any form whatsoever, and other documents and data (and copies thereof) and relating to the Company or any subsidiary which he may then possess or have under his control or to which the Executive had access to or possession of in the course of such employment. 
  7.  PROTECTION OF OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS 
  7.1  Additional Protection of Confidential Information  .    For and in consideration of the benefits set forth in this Agreement as well as for the benefits provided by the Company in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement granted on the Effective Date ( Restricted Stock Award Agreement ), the Company and Executive agree to the non-competition provisions of this Section 7.  Further, the Executive agrees that due to the Executive s knowledge of the Confidential Information, the Executive would inevitably use and/or disclose that information, in breach of the Executive s confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations under this Agreement, if the Executive worked in certain capacities or engaged in certain activities for a period of time following the termination of the Executive s employment relationship with the Company, specifically in the position which involved either (i) responsibility and decision-making authority or input at the executive level regarding any subject, (ii) responsibility or decision-making authority or input at any management level in the Executive s individual area of assignment with the Company, or (iii) responsibility or decision-making authority or input that otherwise allows for the use of the Confidential Information for the benefit of any person (including the Executive) or entity that competes with the Company.  Therefore, for two (2) years following the termination of Executive s employment with the Company for any reason, the Executive agrees not to be employed by, consult for or otherwise act on behalf of any person or entity (without regard to geographic location) for a business that competes with the Company.  For purposes of the foregoing, a business shall be deemed to compete with the Company if such business (a) operates apparel stores in small markets (populations of less than 25,000) and (b) operates a significant number of its apparel stores (75% or more of its total apparel stores) in 10,000 to 30,000 square foot formats.  In addition, the Executive and the Company expressly agree that regardless of the requirements set forth in 7.1(a) and (b), the following entities (including their respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions) compete with the Company and are subject to the provisions of this Section 7:  Macy s, Inc., Kohl s Corporation, Ulta Salon, Cosmetics   Fragrance, Inc., Belk, Inc., J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Gordmans Stores, Inc., Dillards, Inc., The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc., Beall s, Inc., Stein Mart, Inc., The TJX Companies, Inc., Ross Stores, Inc., Ascena Retail Group, Inc., The Cato Corporation, Hibbett Sports Inc., Academy, Ltd., Francesca s Holdings Corporation, and Charming Charlie LLC.  The Executive acknowledges that this commitment is  
  
    14 

intended to protect the Confidential Information and is not intended to be applied or interpreted as a covenant against competition. 
  7.2  Reasonableness of Restriction  .    The Company has attempted to place the most reasonable limitations on the Executive s subsequent business activities as are necessary to protect the Confidential Information and the Executive agrees that such restrictions are reasonable.  In order to accommodate the Executive in obtaining subsequent employment, the Company may, in its discretion, grant a waiver of one or more of the restrictions or subsequent business activities described in Section 7.1.  A request for a waiver shall be in writing and must be received by the Company at least thirty (30) days before the proposed commencement date of the position or services for which the Executive is seeking a waiver.  The request must include the full name and address of the organization with or for which the Executive proposes to perform the services, the title to be held or capacity to be occupied by the Executive and a complete description of the responsibilities, decision-making authority and duties the Executive expects to perform in such employment, consulting or other capacity.  If the Company decides to grant a waiver in its sole discretion, the waiver may be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Company may impose.  Also, the granting of such waiver shall not be deemed to make the Confidential Information public and the Confidential Information shall remain confidential.  Further, except as specifically provided in the waiver, the Executive s obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure under this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. 
  7.3  Protection of Other Business Relationships  .    The Executive understands that the Executive s position with the Company is one of trust and confidence and that he has an obligation to protect the Company s assets, including its investment in the training of its other employees, both during and following his employment relationship.  Therefore, the Executive agrees that for two (2) years following his employment with the Company, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly on behalf of any person (including the Executive) or entity, solicit any of the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries or successor to cease employment with the Company or any subsidiary or successor.  
  7.4  Non-Solicitation  .    The Executive understands that his position with the Company is one of trust and confidence and that he has an obligation to protect the Company s and its Subsidiaries  assets, including their investment in the training of other employees and the cultivation of vendor relationships, both during and following the Executive s employment.  Accordingly, during and for two (2) years following termination of the Executive s employment with the Company for any reason, the Executive agrees not to, directly or indirectly, on behalf of the Executive or any other person or entity:  (a) encourage or solicit any of the employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective successors to cease employment with the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective successors; or (b) solicit or accept business of, or call upon, any vendor, customer or client of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective successors for the purpose of conducting a competitive business or otherwise seeking profit from a competitive activity. 
  7.5  Future Employment  .    If the Executive in the future seeks or is offered employment, or any other position or capacity (including as a consultant) with another person or entity, the Executive agrees to inform each new employer or entity, before accepting employment or other capacity, of the existence of the restrictions contained in Section 7.  Further, before  
  
    15 

accepting any employment or other capacity with any person during the restriction period described in Section 7.1, the Executive agrees to give prior written notice to the Company of the name of such person or entity, the nature of the position or capacity, the responsibilities and duties of the position or capacity, and the industry or industries in which such other person or entity operates.  The Company shall be entitled to advise such person or entity of the provisions of Section 7 and to otherwise deal with such person or entity to ensure that the provisions of Section 7 are enforced and duly discharged. 
  7.6  Tolling of Restrictive Periods  .    If the Executive violates any of the restrictions contained in Section 7, the restrictive periods shall be suspended and will not run in favor of the Executive until such time as the Executive cures the violation to the satisfaction of the Company. 
  7.7  Materiality and Conditionality of Section  .    The provisions of Section 7 are material to this Agreement.  Executive s agreement to strictly comply with Section 7 is a precondition for Executive entering into this Agreement and for the receipt and vesting of the restricted stock award pursuant to Restricted Stock Award Agreement.  Whether or not Section 7 or any portion thereof has been held or found invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction, upon any violation of Section 7 or any portion thereof, or upon a finding that a violation would have occurred if such Section 7 or any portion thereof were enforceable, the Executive and the Company agree that: (i) the Executive s interest in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement (including the underlying restricted stock) shall automatically lapse and be forfeited; (ii) the Company shall have no obligation to make any further payments to the Executive of any nature; (iii) the Company shall be entitled to receive the full value of any payments which were previously made to the Executive, as well as the value of the Restricted Stock Award Agreement that may have vested, during the twelve (12) months preceding the date of the Executive s termination, for any reason, to the date on which a court or arbitration panel held or found the restrictions described in Section 7.1 to have been violated; (iv) the Executive s interest in any post-termination payment pursuant to Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 of this Agreement shall automatically lapse and be forfeited; (v) the Company shall have no obligation to make any further payments to the Executive under the terms of Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 of the Employment Agreement; and (vi) the Company shall be entitled to receive the full value of any payments which were previously made to the Executive pursuant to Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 of the Employment Agreement in the previous twelve (12) months. 
  8.  ARBITRATION  .    Should any dispute arise relating to the meaning, interpretation, enforcement or application of this Agreement, the dispute shall be settled in Harris County, Texas, in accordance with the terms, conditions and requirements described or contained in the Company s arbitration policy, if any, and Rules of the American Arbitration Association governing individual employee agreements, and all costs of such arbitration including, but not limited to reasonable attorney s fees and costs, shall be borne by the losing party.  The Company, however, shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any provisions of this Agreement. 
  In the event the Company does not have an arbitration program,     the Executive and the Company acknowledge that their employment relationship and this Agreement relate to interstate commerce and agree that any disputes, claims or controversies between the Executive and the Company or any subsidiary which may arise out of the Executive s employment relationship with  
  
    16 

Company and/or this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration.  Any arbitration shall be in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association governing individual employee agreements and shall be undertaken pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.  Arbitration will be held before a single arbitrator in Harris County, Texas unless the Executive and the Company or the involved Subsidiary mutually agree on another location.  The decision of the arbitrator will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The arbitrator may award costs and attorneys  fees in connection with the arbitration to the prevailing party; however, in the arbitrator s discretion, each party may be ordered to bear that party s own costs and attorneys  fees.  Punitive, liquidated or indirect damages shall not be awarded by the arbitrator unless such damages would be awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction applying the relevant law.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award injunctive or other equitable relief; however, nothing in this agreement to arbitrate, shall preclude the Company or involved subsidiary from obtaining injunctive relief or other equitable from a court of competent jurisdiction prohibiting any on-going breaches of this Agreement by the Executive while the arbitration is pending. 
  9.  NOTICES  .    Any notice provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either personally delivered, or mailed by first class mail, return receipt requested, to the recipient at the address indicated below: 

or such other address or to the attention of such other person as the recipient party shall have specified by prior written notice to the sending party.  Any notice under this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given when so delivered or mailed. 
  10.  GOVERNING LAW  .    Except as provided in Section 8, all issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Texas.  In furtherance of the foregoing and except as provided in Section 8, the internal law of the State of Texas shall control the interpretation and construction of this Agreement, even though under the jurisdiction s choice of law or conflict of law analysis, the substantive law of some other jurisdiction would ordinarily apply. 
  
    17 

11.  SEVERABILITY  .    Each section, subsection and lesser section of this Agreement constitutes a separate and distinct undertaking, covenant or provision of this Agreement.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed limited by construction in scope and effect to the minimum extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable, and, in the event that a limiting construction is impossible, the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed severed from this Agreement, but every other provision of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 
  12.  AMENDMENTS; MODIFICATIONS  .    Neither this Agreement nor any term or provision in it may be changed, waived, discharged, rescinded or terminated orally, but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom or which the enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge, rescission or termination is sought. 
  13.  WAIVER  .    No failure on the part of either party to this Agreement to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy created under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy by any such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.  No waiver by either party to this Agreement to any breach of, or default in, any term or condition of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of or assent to any succeeding breach of or default in the same or any other term or condition of this Agreement.  The terms and provisions of this Agreement, whether individually or in their entirety, may only be waived in writing and signed by the party against whom or which the enforcement of the waiver is sought. 
  14.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS  .    This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefits of the successors, assigns, heirs, legatees, devisees, executors, administrators, receivers, trustees and representatives of the Executive and the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective successors, assigns, administrators, receivers, trustees and representatives. 
  15.  HEADINGS  .    The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 
  16.  COUNTERPARTS  .    This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which is deemed to be an original and both of which taken together constitute one and the same agreement. 
  17.  FEES AND EXPENSES  .    All costs and expenses incurred by either party in the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement shall be borne solely by the party incurring such expense without right of reimbursement. 
  18.  FURTHER ASSURANCES  .    The     Executive and the Company covenant and agree that each will execute any additional instruments and take any actions as may be reasonably requested by the other party to confirm or perfect or otherwise to carry out the intent and purpose of this Agreement. 
  19.  CONSTRUCTION  .    In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Executive and the Company, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 
  
    18 

20.  SURVIVAL  .    The     Executive and the Company agree that the terms and conditions of Sections 4 through 15 (inclusive), 19, 20 and 21 shall survive and continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding any expiration or termination of the Employment Period or this Agreement. 
  21.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT  .    This Agreement contains and constitutes the entire agreement between the Executive and the Company and supersedes and cancels any prior agreements, representations, warranties, or communications, whether oral or written, between the Executive and the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to the subject matter hereof in any way. 
  22.  GENDER; NUMBER PLURALITY  .    Unless the context otherwise requires, whenever used in this Agreement the singular shall include the plural, the plural shall include the singular, and the masculine gender shall include the neuter or feminine gender and vice versa.

 EXHIBIT 10.2

Exhibit 

INDEMNITY AGREEMENT 
  This Indemnity Agreement ( Agreement ) is made as of __________, 20__, by and between STAGE STORES, INC., a Nevada corporation ( Company ), and _______________ ( Indemnitee ).  This Agreement supersedes and replaces any and all previous agreements between the Company and Indemnitee covering the subject matter of this Agreement.  
  RECITALS 
  WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve publicly-held corporations as directors and officers or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance and indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation; 
  WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company ( Board ) has determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities; 
  WHEREAS, Nevada Revised Statutes 78.7502 and 78.751 ( Statutes ) empower the Company to indemnify and advance expenses to its officers, directors, employees and agents by agreement and to indemnify and advance expenses to persons who serve, at the request of the Company, as directors, officers, employees, or agents of other corporations or enterprises, and expressly provides that the indemnification provided by the Statutes is not exclusive; 
  WHEREAS, the Bylaws of the Company (as amended, the  Bylaws ) provide for mandatory indemnification of its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, subject to certain limitations specified in the Bylaws, and the Company wishes to clarify and enhance the rights and obligations of the Company and the Indemnitee with respect to indemnification; 
  WHEREAS, in order to induce and encourage highly experienced and capable persons such as the Indemnitee to serve and continue to serve as directors and officers of the Company and its affiliates and/or in other capacities with respect to the Company and its affiliates, and to otherwise promote the desirable end that such persons will resist what they consider unjustified lawsuits and claims made against them in connection with the good faith performance of their duties to the Company, with the knowledge that certain costs, judgments, liabilities and expenses incurred by them in their defense of such litigation are to be borne by the Company, the Board of the Company has determined that the following Agreement is reasonable and prudent to promote and ensure the best interests of the Company and its shareholders; and 
  WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Bylaws and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows: 
  Section 1.  Service by Indemnitee.    The Indemnitee will serve and/or continue to serve as a director or officer of the Company, or in such other capacity designated by the Company, faithfully and to the best of the Indemnitee s ability so long as the Indemnitee is duly elected, appointed or designated and until such time as the Indemnitee is removed, terminated, or tenders a resignation that is accepted by the Board.

4 

Section 5.  Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful  .  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent that Indemnitee is a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, in whole or in part, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection therewith, without the necessity of the determination set forth in Section 11(a) of this Agreement.

For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter. 
  Section 6.  Indemnification For Expenses of a Witness  .

  Section 8.  Exclusions  .  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any indemnification payment in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee:

  (c)  except as provided in Section 13(d) of this Agreement, in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors, officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Board authorized the Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) prior to its initiation or (ii) the Company provides the indemnification, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Company under applicable law.

Section 9.  Advances of Expenses  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (other than Section 13(d)), the Company shall advance, to the extent not prohibited by law, the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) not initiated by Indemnitee, and such advancement shall be made within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding.  Advances shall be unsecured and interest free.  Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitee s ability to repay the Expenses and without regard to Indemnitee s ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this Agreement.  In accordance with Section 13(d), advances shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement, including Expenses incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the Company to support the advances claimed.  The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution and delivery to the Company of this Agreement, which shall constitute an undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to repay the amounts advanced (without interest) to the extent that it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.  No other form of undertaking shall be required other than the execution of this Agreement.  This Section 9 shall not apply to any claim made by Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 8. 
  Section 10.  Procedure for Notification and Defense of Claim  . 
  (a)  Indemnitee shall notify the Company in writing of any matter with respect to which Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder as soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt by Indemnitee of written notice.  The written notification to the Company shall include a description of the nature of the Proceeding and the facts underlying the Proceeding.  To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request, including such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification following the final disposition of such Proceeding.  The omission by Indemnitee to notify the Company hereunder will not relieve the Company from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise, and any delay in so notifying the Company shall not constitute a waiver by Indemnitee of any rights under this Agreement.  The Chief Executive Officer or Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification. 
  (b)  If the Company shall be obligated to pay the Expenses in connection with any Proceeding against the Indemnitee, the Company shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Proceeding (with counsel consented to by the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), upon the delivery to the Indemnitee of written notice of its election to do so.  After delivery of such notice, consent to such counsel by the Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of separate counsel subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to the same Proceeding, provided that the reasonable fees and expenses of Indemnitee s counsel shall be at the expense of the Company if: 
  (i)  The employment of separate counsel by the Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the Company; 
  (ii)  The Indemnitee or counsel selected by the Company shall have concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and the Indemnitee or among Indemnitees jointly represented in the conduct of any such defense; or 
  (iii)  The Company shall not, in fact, have employed counsel, to which Indemnitee has consented as aforesaid, to assume the defense of such Proceeding. 
  
   6 

(c)  The Company may participate in the Proceeding at its own expense.  The Company will not, without prior written consent of the Indemnitee, effect any settlement of a claim in any threatened or pending Proceeding unless such settlement solely involves the payment of money and includes an unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all liability on any claims that are or were threatened to be made against the Indemnitee in the Proceeding. 
  Section 11.  Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification  . 
  (a)  Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a), a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case:  (i) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board, (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board, (C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (D) if so directed by the Board, by a majority vote of a quorum of shareholders of the Company; and, if it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination.  Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.  Any costs or Expenses (including attorneys  fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification) and the Company indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless from any such costs or Expenses.  The Company promptly will advise Indemnitee in writing with respect to any determination that Indemnitee is or is not entitled to indemnification, including a description with specificity of any reason or basis for which indemnification has been denied. 
  
   7 

(b)  In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 11(b).  If a Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising Indemnitee of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected.  If a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected.  In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within ten (10) days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection;   provided  ,   however  , that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of  Independent Counsel  as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion.  Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel.  If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit.  If, within twenty (20) days after the later of submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof and the final disposition of the Proceeding, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition a court for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other s selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by such court or by such other person as such court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 11(a) of this Agreement.  Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 13(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing). 
  Section 12.  Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings  . 
  (a)  In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 10(a) of this Agreement, and the Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.  Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 
  
   8 

(b)  Subject to Section 13(e), if the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under Section 11 of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law; provided, however, that such 60-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, if the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto; and provided, further, that the foregoing provisions of this Section 12(b) shall not apply (i) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the shareholders pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement and if (A) within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination the Board has resolved to submit such determination to the shareholders for their consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within seventy-five (75) days after such receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of shareholders is called within fifteen (15) days after such receipt for the purpose of making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within sixty (60) days after having been so called and such determination is made thereat, or (ii) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement. 
  (c)  The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of   nolo     contendere   or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee s conduct was unlawful. 
  (d)  For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee s action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the directors or officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with the reasonable care by the Enterprise.  The provisions of this Section 12(d) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement. 
  (e)  The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, trustee, partner, managing member, fiduciary, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement. 
  
   9 

Section 13.  Remedies of Indemnitee  . 
  (a)  Subject to Section 13(e), in the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement within ninety (90) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5, 6 or 7 or the last sentence of Section 11(a) of this Agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, (v) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 3 or 4 of this Agreement is not made within ten (10) days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, or (vi) in the event that the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or Proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, the Indemnitee the benefits provided or intended to be provided to the Indemnitee hereunder, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by a court of Indemnitee s entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses.  Alternatively, Indemnitee, at Indemnitee s option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.  Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 13(a);   provided  ,   however  , that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce Indemnitee s rights under Section 5 of this Agreement.  The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee s right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration. 
  (b)  In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13 shall be conducted in all respects as a   de     novo   trial, or arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination.  In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13 the Company shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be. 
  (c)  If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law. 
  (d)  The Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.  It is the intent of the Company that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Indemnitee not be required to incur legal fees or other Expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Indemnitee s rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Indemnitee hereunder.  The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor) advance, to the extent not prohibited by law, such Expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for indemnification or advance of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or under any directors  and officers  liability insurance policies maintained  
  
   10 

by the Company if, in the case of indemnification, Indemnitee is wholly successful on the underlying claims; if Indemnitee is not wholly successful on the underlying claims, then such indemnification shall be only to the extent Indemnitee is successful on such underlying claims or otherwise as permitted by law, whichever is greater. 
  (e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement of Indemnitee to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding. 
  Section 14.  Non-exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Subrogation  . 
  (a)  The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Articles, the Bylaws, any agreement, a vote of shareholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise.  No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in Indemnitee s Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.  To the extent that a change in the Statutes, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Bylaws, Articles and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.  No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy. 
  (b)  To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, employees, or agents of the Enterprise, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such current or former director, officer, employee or agent under such policy or policies.  If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of such claim or of the commencement of a Proceeding, as the case may be, to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies.  The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies. 
  
   11 

(c)  In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights. 
  (d)  The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable (or for which advancement is provided under this Agreement) under this Agreement if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.

Section 21.  Contribution  .  To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (a) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding; and/or (b) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and/or transaction(s).

  Section 23.  Identical Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.  Only one such counterpart signed by the party against whom enforceability is sought needs to be produced to evidence the existence of this Agreement. 
  Section 24.  Miscellaneous  .  The headings of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part of this Agreement or to affect the construction thereof. 
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be signed as of the day and year first above written.
