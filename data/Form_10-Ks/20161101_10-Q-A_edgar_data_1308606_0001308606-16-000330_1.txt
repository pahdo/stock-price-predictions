EXPLANATORY NOTE 
  The Company is restating its interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. See the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 19, 2016 for additional details.  
  When the Company disposes of real estate assets, if the real estate assets constitute a business, a portion of the Company s goodwill should be allocated to the carrying value of the business disposed of to determine the gain/loss on disposal. Further, when the Company classifies real estate assets that constitute a business as held for sale, the carrying amount used to determine an impairment loss, if any, should include an allocation of goodwill, in accordance with ASC 350  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other." Historically, the Company did not allocate goodwill resulting from the Cole II Merger to real estate assets disposed of or consider the amount of goodwill attributable to real estate assets held for sale in assessing impairment in the Company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2015.  
  As explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-Q/A (as defined below), the restatement is a correction of an error in the application of the accounting treatment under ASC 350. For each real estate asset that constitutes a business that was disposed of or classified as held for sale, the restatement reflects an allocation of goodwill that has been derived based upon the proportionate fair value of the real estate asset to the fair value of the Company s reporting unit (i.e. the Company's equity). 
  The allocation of goodwill to real estate assets disposed of resulted in a decrease in gain on disposition of assets of $  2.2 million   for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and a decrease of $  7.8 million   to goodwill as of March 31, 2015. The allocation of goodwill to real estate assets held for sale resulted in an increase of $  0.6 million   to impairments for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and a decrease of $  1.4 million   to real estate assets held for sale, net as of March 31, 2015. Additionally, the correction of these errors resulted in an increase of $  9.2 million   to accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2015. 
  This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A ( Form 10-Q/A ) to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on May 8, 2015 (the  Original Filing ), is being filed to reflect the restatement of (i) the Company s consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2015 and (ii) the Company s consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders  equity and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2015, and the notes related thereto. Additionally, although the effects were determined to be immaterial, the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 and the Company s consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2014 included in this Form 10-Q/A are being restated to reflect the correction of these errors. For the convenience of the reader, this Form 10-Q/A sets forth the Original Filing in its entirety and only amends and restates Items 1, 2, and 4 of Part I of the Original Filing to reflect the adjustments described above and in Note 2, and the related impact on disclosures. No other information in the Original Filing is amended.  For a more detailed description of these matters, see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q/A. 
  Notably, these adjustments did not negatively impact the following metrics of the Company: 
             
    Revenues; 
                
    Cash position or its total cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities; 
                
    Liquidity; 
                
    Funds from operations ( FFO  
                
    Adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO  
                
    Reported capitalization rates on the sale of assets; and 
                
    Any metric utilized in the determination of executive compensation. 
     Additionally, the Company remains in compliance with all of its debt agreements and financial covenants.   
  Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, Item 6 of Part II of the Original Filing has been amended to contain the currently-dated certifications from our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are attached to this Form 10-Q/A as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2 and 32.1, respectively.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

  (Unaudited) 

Note 1. Organization  
  Company Organization and Operations 
  The Company operates as a self-administered and self-managed REIT that seeks to generate and deliver sustainable and attractive returns for stockholders by investing primarily in and managing a portfolio of single-tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the United States that is generally leased on a long-term, triple-net basis predominantly to tenants operating within retail, office and industrial property types. Single tenant, operationally essential real estate generally refers to free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where tenants conduct activities that are essential to the generation of their sales and profits. 
  The Company s operations are carried out through the Operating Partnership. OP Holdings, one of the Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner and owns   1.0%   of the Operating Partnership. The Corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary are the only limited partners and together own the remaining   99.0%   of the Operating Partnership. 
    
  As of   March 31, 2015  , our undepreciated gross investment in real estate and loans totaled approximately   $8.22 billion  , representing investments in   2,547   properties, including properties securing mortgage loans made by the Company. Of this amount,   98.7%   consisted of our gross investment in real estate, representing ownership of   2,402   properties, having a gross investment of   $8.12 billion  , and the remaining   1.3%   consisted of commercial mortgage loans receivable, having a gross investment of   $107.4 million  , secured by the remaining   145   properties or other related assets.  
  Recent Developments  
    
  2015 Credit Facility     
    
  On March 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into a new   $600.0 million   unsecured Credit Agreement with various lenders with an initial term that expires on March 31, 2019 (extendable at the Operating Partnership's option to March 31, 2020, subject to certain requirements). The 2015 Credit Facility initially bears interest at a borrowing margin of LIBOR plus   1.70%   and replaces the Operating Partnership s previous secured   $400.0 million   revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement includes an accordion feature to increase the size of the 2015 Credit Facility to up to   $1.0 billion  , subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments. 
  ATM Program Activity     
    
  During the   three months ended     March 31, 2015  , the Corporation sold   6.6 million   shares of its common stock having aggregate gross proceeds of   $79.8 million   and aggregate net sales proceeds of   $78.6 million   under its ATM Program. 
  Acquisitions and Dispositions 
    
  During the   three months ended     March 31, 2015  , the Company purchased   53   properties, representing an aggregate gross investment in real estate properties of   $265.5 million  , which includes   $0.2 million   in revenue producing capital expenditures in existing properties. During the same period, the Company sold   15   properties for   $77.2 million   in gross sales proceeds. See Note 4 for additional discussion of the Company's investments.  

Note 2. Restatement  
  The restatement of the Company's consolidated financial statements results from the Company's subsequent accounting for goodwill resulting from the Cole II Merger. Previously, the Company did not allocate goodwill to the disposal of real estate assets or held for sale real estate assets that met the definition of a business under GAAP, as required by ASC 350  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other  in order to determine gain on disposition of assets or impairments, if any, respectively.  

11 

    SPIRIT REALTY CAPITAL, INC. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued) 
  March 31, 2015 
  (Unaudited) 

For the disposal of real estate assets that constituted a business, goodwill and gain on disposition of assets both should have been reduced by the proportionate amount of goodwill allocated to each disposed of real estate asset. The amount of goodwill allocated is derived as the proportionate fair value of the real estate considered to be a business under GAAP at the time of sale to the fair value of the Company s reporting unit. As a result, the restated consolidated balance sheet includes a reduction to goodwill of $  7.8 million   at March 31, 2015 and the restated consolidated statement of operations includes a reduction to gain on disposition of assets of $  2.2 million   for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The restated consolidated balance sheet includes a reduction to goodwill of $  5.6 million   at December 31, 2014 and the restated consolidated statement of operations includes a reduction to gain on disposition of assets of $  0.2 million   for the three months ended March 31, 2014. 
  Further, in evaluating the impairment on held for sale real estate assets considered to be a business under GAAP, the proportionate amount of goodwill attributable to the real estate asset held for sale should be considered in determining the amount of impairment, if any. The amount of goodwill attributed is derived as the proportionate fair value of the real estate asset considered to be a business under GAAP held for sale at measurement date to the fair value of the Company s reporting unit. As a result, the restated consolidated balance sheet includes a reduction to real estate assets held for sale, net of $  1.4 million   at March 31, 2015 and the restated consolidated statement of operations includes an increase to impairments of $  0.6 million   for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The restated consolidated balance sheet includes a reduction to real estate assets held for sale, net of $  0.9 million   at December 31, 2014 and the restated consolidated statement of operations includes an increase to impairments of $  0.2 million   for the three months ended March 31, 2014. 
    
  The Company has historically presented share repurchases as treasury stock (thereby reducing stockholders  equity) in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of stockholders  equity. However, the Company is incorporated in Maryland and under Maryland law, there is no concept of treasury stock. Therefore, shares repurchased should be considered retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares rather than treasury stock as previously presented. As a result, during the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company has corrected the classification error and the amount previously reported as treasury stock of   $4.9 million   at December 31, 2014 is presented as a reduction to common stock and an increase in accumulated deficit in the restated consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. In addition, the number of shares previously disclosed as issued has been reduced by the number of shares repurchased of   473,599   at December 31, 2014. This change does not affect previously disclosed shares outstanding, total stockholders  equity or earnings per share computations. 
  The consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q/A have been restated as of March 31, 2015 and for the three months then ended to reflect the adjustments described above. The consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q/A have been restated as of December 31, 2014 and for the three months ended March 31, 2014 to reflect the adjustments described above. The following statements present the effect of the restatement on (i) the Company's consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, (ii) the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 and (iii) the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. The Company did not present a summary of the effect of the restatement on the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity for any of the above referenced periods because the impact to stockholders' equity is reflected below in the restated consolidated balance sheets. The Company did not present a summary of the effect of the restatement on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for any of the above referenced periods because the impact to net income is reflected below in the restated consolidated statements of operations and the restatement adjustments did not affect any other component of comprehensive income.

Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
  Basis of Accounting and Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial statements include the normal, recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the information required to be set forth therein. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year. Certain information and note disclosures, normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, have been condensed or omitted from these statements pursuant to SEC rules and regulations and, accordingly, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements as filed with the SEC in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2014  .  
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The Company has formed numerous special purpose entities to acquire and hold real estate encumbered by indebtedness (see Note 5). As a result, the majority of the Company s consolidated assets are held in these wholly-owned special purpose entities. Each special purpose entity is a separate legal entity and is the sole owner of its assets and responsible for its liabilities. The assets of these special purpose entities are not available to pay, or otherwise satisfy obligations to, the creditors of any owner or affiliate of the special purpose entity. At   March 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , net assets totaling   $5.2 billion   and   $5.7 billion  , respectively, were held, and net liabilities totaling   $3.6 billion   and   $3.8 billion  , respectively, were owed by these special purpose entities and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although management believes its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to conform to the current period presentation. During the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 described below. Under the ASU, capitalized deferred financing costs, previously recorded in deferred costs and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability these costs relate to and retrospectively applied to prior periods. As of December 31, 2014, unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately   $48.7 million   was previously presented in deferred costs and other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheet. Of the   $48.7 million  ,   $46.3 million   is now presented as a reduction of debt as of December 31, 2014. The remaining   $2.3 million   continues to be included in deferred costs and other assets, net as it relates to the revolving credit facilities.   
  Segment Reporting 
  The Company views its operations as   one   segment, which consists of net leasing operations. The Company has no other reportable segments. 
  Real Estate Investments 
  Purchase Accounting and Acquisition of Real Estate -   When acquiring a property for investment purposes, the Company allocates the purchase price (including acquisition and closing costs) to land, building, improvements, and equipment based on their relative fair values. For properties acquired with in-place leases, the Company allocates the purchase price of real estate to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values, and acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. In making estimates of fair values for this purpose, the Company uses a number of sources, including independent appraisals and information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence and its marketing and leasing activities.

Lease Intangibles -   Lease intangibles, if any, acquired in conjunction with the purchase of real estate represent the value of in-place leases and above- or below-market leases. For real estate acquired subject to existing lease agreements, in-place lease intangibles are valued based on the Company s estimates of costs related to tenant acquisition and the carrying costs that would be incurred during the time it would take to locate a tenant if the property were vacant, considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases at the time of the acquisition, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining initial term of the related lease. Above- and below-market lease intangibles are recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the leases at the time of acquisition of the real estate and the Company s estimate of current market lease rates for the property, measured over a period equal to the remaining initial term of the lease. Capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases as a decrease in rental revenue. Below-market lease intangibles are amortized as an increase in rental revenue over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases plus any fixed-rate renewal periods on those leases. Should a lease terminate early, the unamortized portion of any related lease intangible is immediately recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
    
  The Company reviews its rent and other tenant receivables for collectability on a regular basis, taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates, and economic conditions in the area in which the tenant operates. The Company provided for reserves for uncollectible amounts totaling   $9.2 million   and   $8.4 million   at   March 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively, against accounts receivable balances of   $22.4 million   and   $21.3 million  , respectively; receivables are recorded within deferred costs and other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  For deferred rental revenues related to the straight-line method of reporting rental revenue, the collectability review includes management s estimates of amounts that will not be realized and an assessment of the risks inherent in the portfolio, giving consideration to historical experience and industry default rates for long-term receivables.  The Company established a provision for losses of   $9.0 million   and   $10.9 million   at   March 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively, against deferred rental revenue receivables of   $50.7 million   and   $48.3 million  , respectively.  
  Loans Receivable 
  Impairment and Allowance for Loan Losses -   The Company periodically evaluates the collectability of its loans receivable, including accrued interest, by analyzing the underlying property-level economics and trends, collateral value and quality, and other relevant factors in determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses. A loan is determined to be impaired when, in management s judgment based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Specific allowances for loan losses are provided for impaired loans on an individual loan basis in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less disposition costs. Delinquent loans receivable are written off against the allowance when all possible means of collection have been exhausted. There was   no   allowance for loan losses at   March 31, 2015   or   December 31, 2014  .  
  A  loan is placed on nonaccrual status when the loan has become   60 days   past due, or earlier if management determines that full recovery of the contractually specified payments of principal and interest is doubtful. While on nonaccrual status, interest income is recognized only when received. As of   March 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , there were no mortgages or notes on nonaccrual st  atus.

Restricted Cash and Escrow Deposits 
    
  Restricted cash and deposits in escrow, classified within deferred costs and other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consisted of the following (in thousands): 

(1)      Funds held in reserve by lenders which, at their sole discretion, can be applied to the repayment of debt. Any funds remaining on deposit after the debt is paid in full are released to the borrower.  
   (2)     Deposits held on collateral properties by lenders that are reserved to fund tenant improvements, repairs and leasing commissions incurred to secure a new tenant.  
   (3)     Proceeds from the sale of assets within the Spirit Master Funding Program, which are held on deposit as collateral until a qualifying substitution is made. 
   (4)     Includes net sales proceeds from property dispositions that can be released upon qualified re-investment from 1031 Exchanges. 
   (5)     Funds held in lender controlled accounts generally used to meet future debt service or certain property operating expenses. 
   (6)      Funds held in lender controlled accounts released within the following month after debt service requirements are met.  
    
  A significant amount of these reserves were established in connection with obtaining lender consents relating to our IPO during 2012 and the Cole II Merger during 2013. 
  Income Taxes 
  The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax provided it continues to satisfy certain tests concerning the Company s sources of income, the nature of its assets, the amounts distributed to its stockholders, and the ownership of Company stock. Management believes the Company has qualified and will continue to qualify as a REIT and therefore,   no   provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to state and local income and franchise taxes, and to federal income tax and excise tax on its undistributed income.  
  Franchise taxes are included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through the Company s taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal, state, and local taxes, which are not material. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or the SEC that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, these new accounting pronouncements entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and therefore will have minimal, if any, impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations upon adoption. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires that deferred financing costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.

Note 4. Investments 
  Real Estate Investments 
    
  As of March 31, 2015, the Company's gross investment in real estate and loans totaled approximately   $8.22 billion  , representing investments in   2,547   properties, including   145   properties securing mortgage loans. The gross investment is comprised of land, buildings, lease intangible assets and lease intangible liabilities, as adjusted for any impairment, and the carrying amount of loans receivable, real estate assets held under direct financing leases and real estate assets held for sale. The portfolio is geographically dispersed throughout   49   states with only   one   state, Texas, with an   11.9%   investment, accounting for more than   10%   of the total dollar amount of the Company s investment portfolio. 
    
  The properties that the Company owns are leased to tenants under long-term operating leases that typically include one or more renewal options. The leases are generally triple-net, which provides that the lessee is responsible for the payment of all property operating expenses, including property taxes, maintenance and repairs, and insurance costs. Therefore, the Company is generally not responsible for repairs or other capital expenditures related to its properties, unless the property is not subject to a lease agreement.  
  During the   three   months ended   March 31, 2015  , the Company had the following real estate and loan activity, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, as restated: 

(1)    Includes investments of   $0.2 million   in revenue producing capitalized expenditures, as well as   $0.2 million   of non-revenue producing capitalized maintenance expenditures. Capitalized maintenance expenditures are not included in the Company's gross investments in real estate disclosed elsewhere.  
   (2)    The total accumulated depreciation and amortization associated with these dispositions of real estate was   $12.5 million  .  
   (3)     During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company sold   6   properties for   $39.4 million   under 1031 Exchanges of which     $32.5 million   of this amount was used to partially fund   4   property acquisitions.  
   (4)    At   March 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  ,   42   and   37  , respectively, of the Company's properties were vacant, not subject to a lease and in the Company s possession; of this amount   14   and   8  , respectively, of these properties were held for sale.

Scheduled minimum future contractual rent to be received under the remaining non-cancelable term of the operating leases at   March 31, 2015   (in thousands):  

Because lease renewal periods are exercisable at the option of the lessee, the preceding table presents future minimum lease payments due during the initial lease term only. In addition, the future minimum rentals do not include any contingent rentals based on a percentage of the lessees' gross sales or lease escalations based on future changes in the CPI or other stipulated reference rate. 
  Certain of the Company s leases contain tenant purchase options. Most of these options are at or above fair market value at the time the option is exercisable, and none of these purchase options represent bargain purchase options. 
  Loans Receivable

Note 5. Debt 
  The Company's debt is summarized below: 

(1)    The effective interest rates include amortization of debt discount, amortization of deferred financing costs and non-utilization fees, where applicable, calculated for the three months ended   March 31, 2015   and based on the average principal balance outstanding during the period. The average outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Credit Facilities was not significant during the three months ended March 31, 2015, resulting in an effective interest rate that was not meaningful. 
   (2)    Represents the weighted average stated interest rate based on the outstanding principal balance as of   March 31, 2015  . 
   (3)    Represents the weighted average time to maturity based on the outstanding principal balance as of   March 31, 2015  . 
   (4)    Variable-rate notes are predominantly hedged with interest rate swaps (see Note 6). 
   (5)    The Company early adopted ASU 2015-03 requiring deferred financing costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related indebtedness.  
  Revolving Credit Facilities 
  2015 Credit Facility  
  On March 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into the Credit Agreement and established a new   $600.0 million   unsecured credit facility and terminated its secured   $400.0 million   2013 Credit Facility. The 2015 Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2019 (extendable at the Operating Partnership's option to March 31, 2020, subject to satisfaction of certain requirements). The 2015 Credit Facility includes an accordion feature to increase the committed facility size to up to   $1.0 billion  , subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments. The 2015 Credit Facility includes a   $50.0 million   sublimit for swingline loans and up to   $60.0 million   available for issuances of letters of credit. Swingline loans and letters of credit reduce availability under the 2015 Credit Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 
  The 2015 Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus   1.70%   based the Company's current leverage grid pricing per annum, with an unused fee of   0.15%  . If the Corporation obtains an investment grade rating of its senior unsecured long-term indebtedness of at least BBB- or Baa3 from S P or Moody's, respectively, the Operating Partnership may make an irrevocable election to change the grid pricing for the 2015 Credit Facility from leverage based to credit rating based pricing. Upon such an event, the 2015 Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to either LIBOR plus   0.875%   to   1.55%   per annum. In each case, the applicable borrowing margin depends on the credit rating for the Corporation. 
    
  If the Corporation obtains an investment grade credit rating from either S P or Moody s, the Operating Partnership will be required to pay a facility fee in an amount equal to the aggregate revolving credit commitments (whether or not utilized) multiplied by a rate equal to   0.125%   to   0.30%   per annum, depending on the credit rating for the Corporation.

The Operating Partnership may voluntarily prepay the 2015 Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time, without premium or penalty, but subject to applicable LIBOR breakage fees, if any. Payment of the 2015 Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation and certain of the existing and future subsidiaries that are not currently securing or anticipated to secure other indebtedness. The 2015 Credit Facility is full recourse to the Operating Partnership and the aforementioned guarantors.  
    
  As a result of entering into the 2015 Credit Facility, the Company incurred origination costs of   $3.5 million  . These costs are being amortized to interest expense over the remaining initial term of the 2015 Credit Facility.   
    
  As of   March 31, 2015  ,   $170.0 million   was outstanding and   $430.0 million   of borrowing capacity was available under the 2015 Credit Facility. The Operating Partnership's ability to borrow under the 2015 Credit Facility is subject to ongoing compliance with a number of customary financial covenants and other customary affirmative and negative covenants. As of March 31, 2015, the Corporation and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with these financial covenants.  
  2013 Credit Facility  
  On March 31, 2015, the secured 2013 Credit Facility was terminated and its outstanding borrowings were repaid with proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility.  Properties securing this facility became unencumbered upon its termination.  The 2013 Credit Facility's borrowing margin was LIBOR plus   2.50%   based on the Company's current leverage grid pricing per annum, with an unused fee of   0.35%  . Upon terminating the 2013 Credit Facility, the Company recognized debt extinguishment costs of   $2.0 million  , resulting from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. 
  Line of Credit 
  A special purpose entity indirectly owned by the Corporation has access to a   $40.0 million   secured revolving line of credit. The initial term of the Line of Credit expires in March 2016, and each advance under the Line of Credit has a   24  -month term.  As of   March 31, 2015  ,   $15.1 million   was outstanding on the Line of Credit under   three   separate advances and secured by   three   properties. Outstanding advances under the Line of Credit incurred a weighted average effective interest rate of   3.89%   during the three months ended   March 31, 2015  . The weighted average stated rate as of   March 31, 2015   was   3.58%  . The ability to borrow under the Line of Credit is subject to the Operating Partnership and special purpose entity's ongoing compliance with a number of customary financial covenants. As of   March 31, 2015  , the Operating Partnership and, if applicable, the special purpose entity were in compliance with these financial covenants.  
  Master Trust Notes  
    
  The Company has access to an asset-backed securitization platform, the Spirit Master Funding Program, to raise capital through the issuance of non-recourse net-lease mortgage notes collateralized by commercial real estate, net-leases and mortgage loans. The Spirit Master Funding Program consists of two separate securitization trusts, Master Trust 2013 and Master Trust 2014, each of which have one or multiple bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entities as issuers or co-issuers of the notes. Each issuer is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation.

The Master Trust Notes are summarized below: 

(1)    The effective interest rates include amortization of debt discount and amortization of deferred financing costs calculated for the three months ended   March 31, 2015   based on the average principal balance outstanding during the period. 
   (2)    Represents the individual series stated interest rate as of   March 31, 2015   and the weighted average stated rate of the total Master Trust Notes, based on the collective series outstanding principal balances as of   March 31, 2015  . 
    
  As of   March 31, 2015  , the Master Trust 2014 notes were secured by   963   properties, including   82   properties securing mortgage loans issued by five indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation. The notes issued under Master Trust 2014 are cross-collateralized by the assets of all issuers within this trust. As of   March 31, 2015  , the Master Trust 2013 notes were secured by   313   properties, including   77   properties securing mortgage loans, issued by a single indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation.  
    
  CMBS  
    
  As of   March 31, 2015  , indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation were borrowers under   163   fixed and   11   variable-rate non-recourse loans which have been securitized into CMBS and are secured by the borrowers' respective leased properties and related assets. The stated interest rates as of   March 31, 2015   for these fixed-rate notes ranged from   3.90%   to   8.39%  . The stated interest rates as of   March 31, 2015   for the variable-rate notes ranged from   2.67%   to   3.68%  . As of   March 31, 2015  , these fixed and variable-rate loans were secured by   505   and   123   properties, respectively. The Company entered into interest rate swaps that effectively fixed the interest rates at approximately   4.55%   on a significant portion of the variable-rate debt (see Note 6).  
    
  As of   March 31, 2015  , certain borrowers were in default under the loan agreements relating to   four   separate CMBS fixed-rate loans where the   12   properties securing the respective loans are no longer generating sufficient revenue to pay the required debt service. The default interest rate on these loans was between   9.52%   and   10.88%  . Each defaulted borrower is a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity and the sole owner of the collateral securing the loan obligations. As of   March 31, 2015  , the aggregate principal balance under the defaulted CMBS loans was   $77.4 million  , which includes   $4.4 million   of interest added to principal. In addition, approximately   $14.0 million   of lender controlled restricted cash is being held in connection these loans that may be applied to reduce amounts owed.

Convertible Notes 
    
  In May 2014, the Corporation issued   $402.5 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.875%   convertible notes due in 2019 and   $345.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.75%   convertible notes due in 2021. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes will mature on   May 15, 2019   and the 2021 Notes will mature on   May 15, 2021  . 
    
  The Convertible Notes are convertible only during certain periods and, subject to certain circumstances, into cash, shares of the Corporation's common stock, or a combination thereof. The initial conversion rate applicable to each series is   76.3636   per   $1,000   principal note (equivalent to an initial conversion price of   $13.10   per share of common stock, representing a   22.5%   premium above the public offering price). Earlier conversion may be triggered if shares of the Corporation's common stock trade higher than the established thresholds, if the Convertible Notes trade below established thresholds, or certain corporate events occur. 
    
  In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company recorded a discount of   $56.7 million  , which represents the estimated value of the embedded conversion feature for each of the Convertible Notes. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of each of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes. As of   March 31, 2015  , the unamortized discount was   $49.4 million  . The discount is shown net against the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Convertible Notes on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The equity component of the conversion feature is recorded in capital in excess of par value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, net of financing transaction costs.  
    
  In connection with the offering, the Company also incurred   $19.6 million   in deferred financing costs. This amount has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to each of the Convertible Notes and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of each note. As of March 31, 2015, the unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the Convertible Notes was   $17.0 million  . 
    
  Debt Extinguishment 
    
  During the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company extinguished a total of   $162.8 million   aggregate principal amount of senior mortgage indebtedness with a weighted average contractual interest rate of   5.76%   and terminated the 2013 Credit Facility. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a net loss on debt extinguishment of approximately   $1.2 million  .  
    
  Debt Maturities 
    
  As of   March 31, 2015  , scheduled debt maturities of the Company s Revolving Credit Facilities, mortgages and notes payable and Convertible Notes, including balloon payments, are as follows (in thousands): 

(1)      The balloon payment balance in 2015 includes   $77.4 million   for the acceleration of principal payable following an event of default under   four   separate non-recourse CMBS loans.

Note 6. Derivative and Hedging Activities  
  The Company uses interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt. These derivatives are considered cash flow hedges and are recorded on a gross basis at fair value and included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Assessments of hedge effectiveness are performed quarterly using regression analysis and the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness is based on the hypothetical derivative method. The effective portion of changes in fair value are recorded in AOCL and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion is recorded immediately in earnings in general and administrative expenses. 
  The following table summarizes the notional amount and fair value of the Company s derivative instruments (dollars in thousands): 

(1)     Represents a tranche of   eight   individual interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts ranging from   $7.6 million   to   $7.9 million  . The swap agreements contain the same payment terms, stated interest rate, effective date, and maturity date.

  The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company believes it mitigates its credit risk by entering into agreements with counterparties it considers credit-worthy. As of   March 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , there were no termination events or events of default related to the interest rate swaps.

Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies  
  The Company is periodically subject to claims or litigation in the ordinary course of business, including claims generated from business conducted by tenants on real estate owned by the Company. In these instances, the Company is typically indemnified by the tenant against any losses that might be suffered, and the Company and/or the tenant are typically insured against such claims. 
  As of   March 31, 2015  , there were   no   outstanding claims against the Company that are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  As of   March 31, 2015  , the Company had commitments totaling   $194.7 million  , of which   $185.3 million   relates to future acquisitions with the remainder to fund improvements on properties the Company currently owns. Commitments related to acquisitions contain standard cancellation clauses contingent on results of due diligence. All commitments are expected to be funded during fiscal year 2015. In addition, the Company is contingently liable for   $5.7 million   of debt owed by   one   of its tenants and is indemnified by that tenant for any payments the Company may be required to make on such debt. 
  The Company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. The Company considers various factors when estimating its environmental liabilities, and adjustments are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues. When only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than another, the low end of the range is recorded in the consolidated financial statements.  

Note 9. Fair Value Measurements  
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company s assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are summarized below. The following table sets forth the Company s financial liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands): 

The interest rate swaps are measured using a market approach, using prices obtained from a nationally recognized pricing service and pricing models with market observable inputs such as interest rates and volatilities. These measurements are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value measurement of an asset on a nonrecurring basis occurs when events or changes in circumstances related to an asset indicate that the carrying amount of the asset is no longer recoverable. The following table sets forth the Company s assets that were accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (in thousands):  

(1)      Impairment charges are presented for the   three months ended     March 31, 2015   and for the year ended   December 31, 2014  . 
  The fair values of impaired real estate and intangible assets were determined by using the following information, depending on availability, in order of preference: signed purchase and sale agreements or letters of intent; recently quoted bid or ask prices, or market prices for comparable properties; estimates of cash flow, which consider, among other things, contractual and forecasted rental revenues, leasing assumptions, and expenses based upon market conditions; and expectations for the use of the real estate. Based on these inputs, the Company determined that its valuation of the impaired real estate and intangible assets falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  Financial assets and liabilities for which the carrying values approximate their fair values include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and escrow deposits, and accounts receivable and payable. Generally, these assets and liabilities are short-term in duration and are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  In addition to the disclosures for assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value at the balance sheet date, companies are required to disclose the estimated fair values of all financial instruments, even if they are not carried at their fair values. The fair values of financial instruments are estimates based upon market conditions and perceived risks at   March 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  . These estimates require management s judgment and may not be indicative of the future fair values of the assets and liabilities.

The estimated fair values of the loans receivable, Revolving Credit Facilities, Convertible Notes and the fixed-rate mortgages and notes payable have been derived based on market quotes for comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses using estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows, market rates and credit spreads. The loans receivable, Revolving Credit Facilities, Convertible Notes and mortgages and notes payable were measured using a market approach from nationally recognized financial institutions with market observable inputs such as interest rates and credit analytics. These measurements are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table discloses fair value information for these financial instruments (in thousands):    

(1)    The carrying value of the debt instruments are net of unamortized deferred financing costs and certain debt discounts. 

Note 10. Significant Credit and Revenue Concentration 
    
  As of   March 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the Company s real estate investments are leased to   474   and   454   tenants, respectively, which operate within retail, office and industrial property types across various industries throughout the United States. Shopko operates in the general merchandise industry and is the Company s largest tenant as a percentage of total revenue. Total rental revenues from properties leased to Shopko for the three months ended   March 31, 2015   and   2014  , contributed   12.8%   and   14.0%   of the Company's total revenues from continuing operations, respectively.   No   other tenant contributed   5%   or more of the Company s total revenues during any of the periods presented. As of   March 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the combined properties that are operated by Shopko represent approximately   12.3%   and   13.1%  , respectively, of the Company s total gross investment portfolio.

Performance Share Awards 
  During the   three   months ended   March 31, 2015  , the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an initial target grant of   236,826   performance shares to certain executive officers of the Company. The performance period of this grant runs from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. Pursuant to the performance share award agreement, each participant is eligible to vest in and receive shares of the Corporation's common stock based on the initial target number of shares granted multiplied by a percentage range between   0%   and   250%  . The percentage range is based on the attainment of TSR of the Corporation compared to certain specified peer groups of companies during the performance period. In addition, final shares issued under each performance share award entitle its holder to a cash payment equal to the aggregate dividends that were declared during the performance period as if the shares had been issued and outstanding on each dividend record date. Based on the grant date fair value, the Corporation expects to recognize   $3.5 million   in compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period associated with this market-based grant.  
  As of   March 31, 2015  , under each separate annual performance share award, the Corporation's TSR compared to the specified peer groups during the performance periods would have resulted in the release of   1.0 million   shares, in the aggregate. In addition, approximately   $0.7 million   in dividend rights have been accrued. The projected shares to be released are not considered issued under the Incentive Award Plan until the performance period has ended and the actual number of shares to be released is determined. The performance shares and dividend rights are subject to forfeiture in the event of a non-qualifying termination of a participant prior to the performance period end date.  
  Stock-based Compensation Expense 
  For the   three   months ended   March 31, 2015   and   2014  , the Company recognized   $3.8 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively, in stock-based compensation expense, which is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  
  As of   March 31, 2015  , the remaining unamortized stock-based compensation expense, including amounts relating to the performance share awards, totaled   $16.2 million  , which is recognized as the greater of the amount amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period of each applicable award or the amount vested over the vesting periods.

Note 14. Income Per Share 
  Income per share has been computed using the two-class method. Income per common share under the two-class method is computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Classification of the Company's unvested restricted stock, which contain rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, are deemed participating securities under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, earnings attributable to unvested restricted shares are deducted from income from continuing operations in the computation of net income attributable to common stockholders. The table below is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted income per share, as restated (dollars in thousands):  

The Corporation intends to satisfy its exchange obligation for the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to the note holders entirely in cash, therefore, the "if-converted" method does not apply and the treasury stock method is being used. As the Corporation's stock price is below the conversion price, there are   no   potentially dilutive shares associated with the Convertible Notes.

Note 15. Subsequent Events 
    
  On April 14, 2015, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of   23.0 million   shares of its common stock, at   $11.85   per share, including   3.0 million   shares issued pursuant to the underwriter s option to purchase additional shares. Gross proceeds raised were approximately   $272.6 million  ; net proceeds were approximately   $268.9 million   after underwriter discounts and offering costs paid by the Company. Net proceeds from the common stock offering were used to repay the outstanding balances under the 2015 Credit Facility and Line of Credit. The remaining net proceeds were retained to fund potential future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.

Overview 
  We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT that primarily invests in single-tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the United States that is leased on a long-term, triple-net basis to tenants operating within retail, office and industrial property types. Single tenant, operationally essential real estate consists of properties that are generally free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where our tenants conduct activities that are essential to the generation of their sales and profits. In support of our primary business of owning and leasing real estate, we have also strategically originated or acquired long-term, commercial mortgage and other loans to provide a range of financing solutions to our tenants. 
  Our operations are carried out through the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership. OP Holdings, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner and owns   1.0%   of the Operating Partnership. We and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the only limited partners, and together own the remaining   99.0%   of the Operating Partnership. Although the Operating Partnership is wholly-owned by us, in the future, we may issue partnership interests in the Operating Partnership to third parties in exchange for property owned by such third parties. In general, any partnership interests in the Operating Partnership issued to third parties would be exchangeable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock at specified ratios set when such partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are issued.  
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2005. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner.  
  We generate our revenue primarily by leasing our properties to our tenants. As of   March 31, 2015  , our undepreciated gross investment in real estate and loans totaled approximately   $8.22 billion  , representing investments in   2,547   properties, including properties securing our mortgage loans. Of this amount,   98.7%   consisted of our gross investment in real estate, representing ownership of   2,402   properties, and the remaining   1.3%   consisted primarily of commercial mortgage loans receivable secured by   145   real properties.  
  As of   March 31, 2015  , our owned properties were approximately   98.3%   occupied (based on number of properties), and our leases had a weighted average non-cancelable remaining lease term (based on total rental revenue) of approximately   10.9   years. Our leases are generally originated with long lease terms, typically non-cancelable initial terms of 15 to 20 years and tenant renewal options for additional years. As of   March 31, 2015  , approximately   89%   of our single-tenant properties (based on total rental revenue) provided for increases in future annual base contractual rent.

Factors that May Influence Our Operating Results  
    
  Acquisitions 
  Our principal line of business is acquiring commercial real estate properties and leasing these properties to our tenants. Our ability to grow revenue and produce superior risk adjusted returns will principally depend on our ability to acquire additional properties that meet our investment criteria at a yield sufficiently in excess of our cost of capital. We primarily focus on opportunities to acquire attractive commercial real estate by providing capital to small and middle-market companies that we conclude have stable and proven operating histories and attractive credit characteristics, but lack the access to capital that large companies often have. Small and middle-market companies are often willing to enter into leases with structures and terms that we consider appealing (such as master leases and leases that require ongoing tenant financial reporting) and that we believe increase the security of rental payments. 
    
  Operationally Essential Real Estate with Relatively Long-Term Leases 
    
  We seek to own properties that are operationally essential to our tenants, thereby reducing the risk that our tenant would choose not to renew an expiring lease or reject a lease in bankruptcy. In addition, we seek to enter into leases with relatively long terms, typically with non-cancelable initial terms of 15 to 20 years and tenant renewal options for additional terms with attractive rent escalation provisions. As of   March 31, 2015  , our leases had a weighted average non-cancelable remaining lease term (based on rental revenue) of approximately   10.9   years compared to approximately   10.2   years as of   March 31, 2014  .  
    
  Portfolio Diversification 
    
  Our strategy emphasizes a portfolio that (1) derives no more than 10% of its annual rent from any single tenant and no more than 2.5% of its annual rent from any single property, (2) is leased to tenants operating in various industries and (3) is located across the United States without significant geographic concentration.  
    
  We believe that our experience, in-depth market knowledge and extensive network of long-standing relationships in the real estate industry will continue to provide us access to an ongoing pipeline of attractive acquisitions. However, because we primarily use external financing to fund acquisitions, periods of volatility in the credit and capital markets that may negatively affect the amounts, sources and cost of capital available to us could force us to limit our acquisition activity. Additionally, to the extent that we access capital at a higher cost (reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or lower stock price for equity financing), our financial results could be adversely affected.    
    
  Our Leases 
    
  Rent Escalators    
    
  Generally, our single-tenant leases contain contractual provisions increasing the rental revenue over the term of the lease at specified dates by: (1) a fixed amount or (2) the lesser of (a) 1 to 1.25 times any increase in CPI over a specified period or (b) a fixed percentage, typically 1% to 2% per year. The percentage of our single-tenant properties (based on total rental revenue) containing rent escalators increased to approximately   89%   as of   March 31, 2015   compared to   87%   as of   March 31, 2014  . 
    
  Master Lease Structure  
    
  Where appropriate, we seek to enter into master leases, pursuant to which we lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an  all or none  basis. We seek to use the master lease structure to prevent a tenant from unilaterally giving up underperforming properties while retaining well-performing properties. Master lease revenue contributed approximately   46%   of our total rental revenues during the month ended   March 31, 2015   compared to   43%   for the same period in   2014  .  
    
  Triple-Net Leases  
    
  Our leases are predominantly triple-net which require the tenant to pay all property operating expenses such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums and repair and maintenance costs. As of   March 31, 2015  , approximately   86.5%   of our single-tenant properties (based on rental revenue) are subject to triple-net leases compared to   85.1%   as of   March 31, 2014  .  
  
   40 

Asset Management 
    
  The stability of the rental revenue generated by our properties depends principally on our tenants  ability to 1) pay rent and our ability to collect rent due 2) renew expiring leases or re-lease space upon expiration or other termination 3) lease currently vacant properties and 4) maintain or increase rental rates. Each of these could be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions, particularly those that affect the markets in which our properties are located, downturns in our tenants  industries, increased competition for our tenants at our property locations, or the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants. We seek to manage these risks by using our developed underwriting and risk management processes to structure and manage our portfolio.  
    
  Active Management and Monitoring of Risks Related to Our Investments 
    
  We seek to measure tenant financial distress risk and lease renewal risk through various processes. Many of our tenants are required to provide corporate-level financial information, which includes balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement data on a quarterly and/or annual basis. Our underwriting and risk management processes are designed to structure new investments and manage existing investments to mitigate tenant credit quality risks and preserve the long-term return on our invested capital. Since our inception, our occupancy has never been below 96.1% (based on number of properties). As of   March 31, 2015  , the percentage of our properties that were occupied was   98.3%   compared to   98.9%   as of   March 31, 2014  .  
    
  Following the 2014 restructuring of the Shopko master lease and defeasance of the related secured indebtedness, we have continued our objective to reduce the tenant concentration of Shopko. During the three months ended   March 31, 2015  , we sold five Shopko properties having a gross investment value of $38.9 million. These sales, coupled with our increased rental revenue from real estate investments of $665.0 million during the past two quarters, have reduced our Shopko tenant concentration to   12.8%   as of   March 31, 2015   compared to 14.0% as of   December 31, 2014  .  
    
  Capital Recycling  
    
  We continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties in our portfolio when we believe such disposition is appropriate in view of our business objectives, considering criteria including, but not limited to, tenant concentration, tenant credit quality, unit financial performance, local market conditions and lease rates, associated indebtedness, asset location, tenant operation type (e.g., industry, sector, or concept/brand), and asset zoning, as well as potential capital appreciation, potential uses of proceeds and tax considerations. As part of this strategy, we attempt to enter into 1031 Exchanges, when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable built-in gains on the dispositions, if any, for federal and state income tax purposes. 
    
  The timing of any potential dispositions, including the disposition of any Shopko properties, will depend on market conditions and other factors, including but not limited to our capital needs and ability to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales. We can provide no assurance that we will dispose of any additional properties or that future acquisitions and/or dispositions, if any, will qualify as 1031 Exchanges. Furthermore, we can provide no assurance that we will deploy the proceeds from future dispositions in a manner that produces comparable or better yields.  
    
  Capital Funding 
    
  Our principal demands for funds are for property acquisitions, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, operating and property maintenance expenses and distributions to our stockholders. Generally, cash needs for payments of principal and interest, operating and property maintenance expenses and distributions to stockholders will be generated from cash flows from operations, which are primarily driven by the rental income received from our leased properties, interest income earned on mortgage notes receivable and interest income on our cash balances. We generally temporarily fund the acquisition of real estate utilizing our Revolving Credit Facilities, followed by permanent financing through asset level financing or by issuing debt or equity securities. 
  Interest Costs 
    
  Our fixed-rate debt structure provides us with a stable and predictable cash requirement related to our debt service. Any changes to our debt structure, including borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility or debt financing associated with property acquisitions, could materially influence our operating results depending on the terms of any such  
  
   41 

indebtedness. A significant amount of our debt provides for scheduled principal payments. As principal is repaid, our interest expense decreases. Changing interest rates will increase or decrease the interest expense we incur on unhedged variable interest rate debt and may impact our ability to refinance maturing debt.  

42 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2014   in the section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  We have not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this quarterly report.  

Results of Operations 
  Comparison of Three Months Ended   March 31, 2015   to Three Months Ended   March 31, 2014 
  The following discussion includes the results of our continuing operations as summarized in the table below:  

NM - Percentages over 100% are not displayed. 
  
   43 

Revenues 
  For the three months ended   March 31, 2015  , approximately   95.2%   of our total revenues was attributable to long-term leases. The year over year increase of 12.7% in total revenue was due primarily to an increase in base rental revenue due to the acquisition of   310   properties, representing an investment in real estate of   $1.08 billion  , during the twelve month period ended   March 31, 2015   and to a lessor extent, revenue increased through contractual rent escalations within our existing real estate portfolio. This increase was partially offset from the sale of   50   properties during the same period having a gross investment value of   $199.5 million  .  
    
  Rentals 
    
  The year over year increase in rental revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisition of 310 properties representing an investment in real estate of   $1.08 billion   during the twelve month period ended   March 31, 2015  . Non-cash rentals for the three months ended   March 31, 2015   and   2014   were   $5.4 million   and   $4.6 million  , respectively. These amounts represent approximately   3.5%   and   3.4%   of total rental revenue from continuing operations for each of the three months ended   March 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. Contractual rent escalations subsequent to   March 31, 2014   also contributed to the increase. 
    
  As of   March 31, 2015  ,   98.3%   of our owned properties were occupied (based on number of properties). The majority of our nonperforming properties were in the restaurant and manufacturing industries. As of   March 31, 2015   and 2014,   42   and 24 of our properties, representing approximately   1.7%   and 1.1%, respectively, of our owned properties were vacant and not generating rent. The increase in the number of vacant properties is primarily attributable to the bankruptcy of two tenants under two master leases comprising sixteen properties within the restaurant and manufacturing industries. Fourteen of our vacant properties were held for sale as of   March 31, 2015  . 
    
  Tenant reimbursement income 
    
  We have a number of leases that require our tenants to reimburse us for certain property costs we incur. Tenant reimbursement income is driven by the tenant reimbursable property costs described below.  
  Expenses  
  General and administrative 
  The year over year increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher compensation and related benefits of $2.3 million, which includes $1.2 million of non-cash stock compensation. The increase in compensation and related benefits is primarily attributable to the acceleration of cash and non-cash stock compensation related to the departure of an executive officer during the most recently completed quarter. These increases were partially offset by $0.5 million in lower professional fees for accounting, tax, audit and consulting and $0.2 million in lower franchise taxes in the current period.  
  Property costs  
    
  For the three months ended March 31, 2015, property costs were $7.4 million (including $4.6 million of tenant reimbursables) as compared to $5.3 million (including $3.3 million in tenant reimbursables) for the same period in 2014. The year over year increase in tenant reimbursable property costs is primarily attributable to increased property taxes at certain of our multi-tenant properties. The remainder of the increase is attributable to higher property taxes and utilities due to a rise in the number of vacant properties between periods in addition to property cost recoveries of approximately $0.5 million during the comparable period in 2014.  
  Interest  
  The year over year increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to a $2.5 million rise in non-cash interest resulting mostly from the amortization of capitalized deferred financing costs of $30.6 million and debt discounts of $56.7 million related to debt offerings that occurred during the past twelve months, which are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the instruments. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2015, we borrowed $1.26 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.69% through our Convertible Notes and series 2014-4 Master Trust Notes offerings, and we extinguished $746.6 million of indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 6.27%. The lower weighted average interest rate partially offset the impact of the increase in our net borrowing amount.   
  
   44 

The following table summarizes our interest expense and related borrowings from continuing operations: 

(1)     Includes interest expense associated with non-utilization fees of approximately   $0.4 million   and   $0.3 million   for the three months ended   March 31, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  Depreciation and amortization  
  Depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to depreciation on the commercial buildings and improvements we own and amortization of the related lease intangibles. The year over year increase is primarily due to the acquisition of   310   properties, representing an investment in real estate of   $1.08 billion  , during the 12 month period ended   March 31, 2015  . The following table summarizes our depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations: 

Impairments 
    
  Impairment charges for the three months ended March 31, 2015 included $1.6 million on the impairment of ten properties that were held for sale and $0.6 million of lease intangible write-offs resulting from lease terminations. For the same period in 2014, impairment charges included $1.0 million on the impairment of one held for sale property, $0.8 million on the impairment of 2 vacant restaurants and $0.1 million of lease intangible write-offs.  
    
  Other expense 
    
  During the three months ended   March 31, 2015  , we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of   $1.2 million   recorded in other expense. The amount of aggregate principal indebtedness extinguished was $162.8 million primarily from property sales encumbered by CMBS debt and other debt prepayments. Approximately $2.0 million of this loss was attributable to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs, partially offset by the net debt premiums on the CMBS debt extinguished. No such items were recognized during the same period in 2014. 
    
  Income tax expense 
  Income tax expense increased approximately   $0.1 million   for the three months ended   March 31, 2015  , as compared to the same period in   2014  . The increase was primarily attributable to additional state tax owed on a prior year return. 

45 

Gain on dispositions of assets 
  For the three months ended March 31, 2015, gain on dispositions of assets included $5.2 million from the sale of 5 Shopko properties and $2.1 million from the sale of one of our distribution properties. During the same period in 2014, the gain on disposition of assets included $1.5 million from the sale of one of our restaurant properties.  

Property Portfolio Information 
  Our diverse real estate portfolio at   March 31, 2015   consisted of   2,402   owned properties:  
              
    located in   49   states as well as in the U.S. Virgin Islands, with only   4   states contributing more than 5% of our rental revenue;  
                
    operating in   27   different industries;  
                 
    with a weighted average remaining lease term of   10.9   years.  
     Property Portfolio Diversification 
  The following tables present the diversity of our properties owned at the end of the reporting period. The portfolio metrics are calculated based on the percentage of  total revenue or rental revenue as noted. Total revenues and total rental revenue used in the calculations are normalized to exclude revenues contributed by properties sold during the given period.  
    
  Diversification By Tenant    
    
  The tenant concentration percentage is computed by dividing a tenant's quarterly rental revenue by the Company's normalized total revenues.  
  The following table lists the top ten tenants of our owned real estate properties as of   March 31, 2015  :  

(1)     Total revenue for the quarter ended   March 31, 2015  , excluding rental revenue contributed from properties sold during the period. 
   (2)     Tenants represent legal entities ultimately responsible for obligations under the lease agreements. Other tenants may operate certain of the same business concepts or brands set forth above, but represent distinct tenant credits.

Lease Expirations    
  The following table sets forth a summary schedule of expiration dates for leases in place as of   March 31, 2015  . As of   March 31, 2015  , the weighted average remaining non-cancelable initial term of our leases (based on total rental revenue) was   10.9   years. The information set forth in the table assumes that tenants exercise no renewal options and or any early termination rights:  

(1)    Total rental revenue for the month ended   March 31, 2015   from properties owned at   March 31, 2015  , multiplied by twelve. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
    
  Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  On a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for operating expenses, distributions to stockholders and interest and principal on current and any future debt financings. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, capital expenditures, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings on the 2015 Credit Facility. On March 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into the 2015 Credit Agreement, establishing a $600.0 million unsecured credit facility and terminated its $400.0 million secured credit facility previously in place. Our 2015 Credit Facility increases our capacity to fund acquisitions, while continuing to meet our short-term working capital requirements. The Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature to increase the size of the 2015 Credit Facility to up to $1.0 billion, subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments.  As of   March 31, 2015  ,   $170.0 million   was outstanding and   $430.0 million   of borrowing capacity was available under the 2015 Credit Facility.  
  We have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we may issue secured or unsecured indebtedness and equity financing through the instruments and on the terms most attractive to us at such time. During the three months ended   March 31, 2015  , we sold an aggregate of   6.6 million   shares under our ATM Program for net proceeds of   $78.6 million  . In addition, subsequent to March 31, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of   23.0 million   shares of our common stock and raised net proceeds of   $268.9 million  . Net proceeds from the common stock offering were used to repay the outstanding balances under the 2015 Credit Facility and Line of Credit. The remaining proceeds were retained to fund potential future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.  
  
   50 

Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We plan to meet our long-term capital needs, including long-term financing of property acquisitions, by obtaining asset level financing, issuing registered debt or equity securities and occasionally by issuing fixed rate secured notes and bonds. We may continue to issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our 2015 Credit Facility or other indebtedness. In the future, some of our property acquisitions could be made by issuing partnership interests of our Operating Partnership in exchange for property owned by third parties. These partnership interests would be exchangeable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock.    
    
  We continually evaluate alternative financing and believe that we can obtain financing on reasonable terms. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us. We expect that our primary uses of capital will be for property and other asset acquisitions and the payment of tenant improvements, operating expenses, including debt service payments on any outstanding indebtedness, and distributions to our stockholders. 
    
  Description of Certain Debt  
    
  Spirit Master Funding Program 
    
  The Spirit Master Funding Program is an asset-backed securitization platform in which we raise capital through the issuance of non-recourse net-lease mortgage notes collateralized by commercial real estate, net-leases and mortgage loans. The Spirit Master Funding Program allows us to issue notes that are secured by the assets of the note issuers which are pledged to the indenture trustee for the benefit of the noteholders and managed by the Operating Partnership as property manager. These Collateral Pools consist primarily of commercial real estate properties, the issuers  rights in the leases of such properties and commercial mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate property. In general, monthly rental and mortgage receipts with respect to the leases and mortgage loans are deposited with the indenture trustee who will first utilize these funds to satisfy the debt service requirements on the notes and any fees associated with the administration of the Spirit Master Funding Program. The remaining funds are remitted to the issuers monthly on the note payment date. 
    
  In addition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, the issuers may, from time to time, sell or exchange real estate properties or mortgage loans from the Collateral Pools. Proceeds from the sale of assets within the Collateral Pools are held on deposit by the indenture trustee until a qualifying substitution is made. At   March 31, 2015  ,   $9.7 million   was held on deposit and classified as restricted cash within deferred costs and other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  The Spirit Master Funding Program consists of two separate securitization trusts which have one or multiple bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entities as issuers of the Master Trust 2013 and Master Trust 2014 notes. Each issuer is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. Notes issued under Master Trust 2014 are cross-collateralized by the assets of all issuers within that trust. All outstanding series of Master Trust Notes were rated investment grade as of   March 31, 2015  . 

51 

The Master Trust Notes are summarized below:   

   (1)    The effective interest rates include amortization of debt discount and amortization of deferred financing costs calculated for the three months ended   March 31, 2015   based on the average principal balance outstanding during the period. 
   (2)    Represents the individual series stated interest rate as of   March 31, 2015   and the weighted average stated rate of the Master Trust Notes, based on the outstanding principal balances as of   March 31, 2015  . 
  As of   March 31, 2015  , the Master Trust 2014 notes were secured by   963   properties, including   82   properties securing mortgage loans issued by five indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation. The notes issued under Master Trust 2014 are cross-collateralized by the assets of all issuers within this trust. As of   March 31, 2015  , the Master Trust 2013 notes were secured by   313   properties, including   77   properties securing mortgage loans, issued by a single indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation.  
  Convertible Notes  
  The Convertible Notes are comprised of two notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $747.5 million   at both   March 31, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  . Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes, aggregate principal amount   $402.5 million  , accrue interest at   2.875%   and are scheduled to mature on   May 15, 2019  . The 2021 Notes, aggregate principal amount   $345.0 million  , accrue interest at   3.75%   and are scheduled to mature on   May 15, 2021  . As of   March 31, 2015  , the carrying amount of the Convertible Notes was   $681.1 million  , which is net of discounts (for the value of the embedded conversion feature) and capitalized deferred financing costs. 
  Holders may convert notes of either series prior to November 15, 2018, in the case of the 2019 Notes, or November 15, 2020, in the case of the 2021 Notes, only under the following circumstances: (1) if the closing price of our common stock for each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days in the quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the Convertible Notes; (2) during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last closing price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes; (3) if we call any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption prior to the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as described in the Convertible Notes prospectus supplement. On or after November 15, 2018, in the case of the 2019 Notes, or November 15, 2020, in the case of the 2021 Notes, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, holders may convert the Convertible Notes of the applicable series at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. 
    
  The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is 76.3636 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $13.10 per share of common stock). The conversion rate for each series of the Convertible Notes is subject to adjustment for some events including dividends paid in excess  
  
   52 

of threshold amounts stipulated in the agreement, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined), holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus     accrued and unpaid interest. 
    
  2015 Credit Facility 
    
  On March 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into the Credit Agreement establishing a new $600.0 million unsecured credit facility and terminated its secured $400.0 million 2013 Credit Facility. The 2015 Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2019 (extendable at the Operating Partnership's option to March 31, 2020, subject to satisfaction of certain requirements). The facility includes an accordion feature to increase the committed size to up to $1.0 billion, subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments. A $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans and up to $60.0 million for issuances of letters of credit is also available. Swingline loans and letters of credit reduce availability under the 2015 Credit Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 
    
  At the election of the Operating Partnership, the 2015 Credit Facility initially bears interest at our current leverage grid pricing equal to either LIBOR plus 1.40% to 1.90% per annum, or a specified base rate plus 0.40% to 0.90% per annum. In each case, the applicable rates depend on our leverage ratio. If the Corporation obtains an investment grade rating of its senior unsecured long-term indebtedness of at least BBB- or Baa3 from S P or Moody's, respectively, the Operating Partnership may make an irrevocable election to change the grid pricing for the 2015 Credit Facility from leverage based to credit rating based pricing. Upon such an event, the 2015 Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to either LIBOR plus 0.875% to 1.55% per annum. In each case, the applicable borrowing margin depends on the credit rating for the Corporation. 
    
  The Operating Partnership is initially required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the 2015 Credit Facility at a rate equal to either 0.15% or 0.25% per annum, based on percentage thresholds for the average daily amount by which the aggregate amount of the revolving credit commitment exceeds the aggregate principal amount of advances during a fiscal quarter. If the Corporation obtains an investment grade credit rating from either S P or Moody s, the Operating Partnership will instead be required to pay a facility fee in an amount equal to the aggregate revolving credit commitments (whether or not utilized) multiplied by a rate equal to 0.125% to 0.30% per annum, depending on the credit rating for the Corporation. 
  The Operating Partnership may voluntarily prepay the 2015 Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time, without premium or penalty, but subject to applicable LIBOR breakage fees, if any. Payment of the 2015 Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation and certain of the existing and future subsidiaries that are not currently securing or anticipated to secure other indebtedness. The 2015 Credit Facility is full recourse to the Operating Partnership and the aforementioned guarantors.  
    
  As of   March 31, 2015  ,   $170.0 million   was outstanding and   $430.0 million   of borrowing capacity was available under the 2015 Credit Facility. Amounts available for borrowing under the 2015 Credit Facility remain subject to compliance with certain customary restrictive covenants including: 

Maximum leverage ratio (defined as consolidated total indebtedness plus the Corporation s pro rata share of indebtedness of unconsolidated affiliates, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total asset value) of 0.60:1.00; 
                
    Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) plus the Corporation s pro rata share of EBITDA of unconsolidated affiliates, to fixed charges) of 1.50:1.00; 
                
    Maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio (defined as consolidated secured indebtedness plus the Corporation s pro rata share of secured indebtedness of unconsolidated affiliates, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total asset value) of 0.50:1:00; 
                
    Minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio (defined as consolidated net operating income from unencumbered properties to unsecured interest expense) of 1.75:1.00; 
                
    Maximum unencumbered leverage ratio (defined as consolidated unsecured indebtedness plus the Corporation s pro rata share of unsecured indebtedness of unconsolidated affiliates, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total unencumbered asset value) of 0.60:1:00; and 
                
    Minimum tangible net worth of at least $3.01 billion plus 75% of the net proceeds of equity issuances by the Corporation or the Operating Partnership after December 31, 2014. 

53 

In addition to these covenants, the Credit Agreement also includes other customary affirmative and negative covenants, such as (i) limitation on liens and negative pledges; (ii) transactions with affiliates; (iii) limitation on mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all assets; (iv) maintenance of status as a REIT and listing on any national securities exchange; and (v) material modifications to organizational documents.  
    
  As of   March 31, 2015  , the Corporation and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with these covenants.  
  2013 Credit Facility  
    
  On March 31, 2015, the 2013 Credit Facility was terminated and its outstanding borrowings of $130.0 million were repaid with funds drawn on the 2015 Credit Facility. Properties securing this facility became unencumbered upon the termination.  
  Line of Credit  
  As of   March 31, 2015  ,   $15.1 million   was outstanding on the Line of Credit under   three   separate advances, secured by   three   properties, at a weighted average stated rate of   3.58%   and a weighted average effective interest rate of   3.89%   for the three months ended   March 31, 2015  . On April 30, 2015, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the Line of Credit, thereby releasing the encumbrances on the properties securing it.  
    
  CMBS  
    
  We may use long-term, fixed-rate debt to finance our properties on a  match-funded  basis. In such events, we seek to use asset level financing that bears annual interest less than the annual rent on the related lease(s) and that matures prior to the expiration of such lease(s). In general, the obligor of our asset level debt is a special purpose entity that holds the real estate and other collateral securing the indebtedness. Each special purpose entity is a bankruptcy remote separate legal entity, and is the sole owner of its assets and responsible for its liabilities.  
    
  As of   March 31, 2015  , we had 178 loans with approximately   $1.78 billion   of outstanding balances under our fixed and variable-rate CMBS loans, with a weighted average contractual interest rate of   5.70%   and a weighted average maturity of   3.0   years. Most of this debt is partially amortizing and requires a balloon payment at maturity. These balances include four separate fixed-rate CMBS loans that are in default due to the underperformance of the 12 properties that secure them. As of   March 31, 2015  , the aggregate principal balance under the defaulted CMBS loans was   $77.4 million  , including   $4.4 million   of default interest added to principal. We believe the value of these properties is less than the related debt. As a result, we have notified the servicers of the indebtedness that the special purpose entity owners anticipate surrendering these properties to them or selling the properties under their direction in exchange for relieving the indebtedness encumbering them. Excluding these four loans, the outstanding principal obligations under our CMBS fixed and variable-rate loans as of March 31, 2015 was $1.71 billion.     

54 

The table below shows the outstanding principal obligations of these CMBS fixed and variable-rate loans as of   March 31, 2015   and the year in which the loans mature. The information displayed in the table excludes amounts and interest rates related to the defaulted loans and the 12 properties securing them.  

CMBS Liquidity Matters 
    
  As of   March 31, 2015  , cash reserves totaling   $17.0 million  , including interest, were held in escrow under a certain CMBS loan. The CMBS loan agreement was amended during 2012 to allow for additional property substitutions and required the borrower to deposit $8.0 million as Additional Collateral Deposit. Pursuant to that amendment, we are permitted to issue a letter of credit for the amount of cash held as the Additional Collateral Deposit. The amended loan agreement also placed more restrictive cash covenants than those provided under the original agreement. During 2014, the servicer notified the borrower that conditions exist under the covenants contained in the loan agreement that permit the servicer to retain Excess Cash as additional deposited collateral beginning as of September 30, 2013. As of   March 31, 2015  , the aggregate amount of Excess Cash held as additional deposited collateral totaled $8.6 million. The right of the servicer to claim Excess Cash continues until (a) the collateral tenant achieves a certain financial performance requirement for four consecutive fiscal quarters (b) no event of default under the loan agreement is continuing, and (c) our long-term debt is rated at or above "BB" by S P and "Ba2" by Moody's.  
    
  As of   March 31, 2015  , the long-term debt of the Corporation was rated at or above "BB" by S P, no event of default existed under the loan agreement and the collateral tenant continues to significantly exceed the financial performance requirements described above for the termination of the cash sweep period as well as for the disbursement of Excess Cash; however, unless and until our long term debt is rated at or above  Ba2  by Moody s, we can provide no assurance that Excess Cash eligible to be retained by the servicer will be distributed, and no assurance can be given that our long-term debt will obtain such a rating from Moody's.  
    
  Pursuant to a consent agreement with the loan servicer entered into as of April 13, 2015, we are now also permitted to issue a letter of credit for the amount of cash held as Excess Cash, and as of March 12, 2015, the servicer will allow future Excess Cash to be disbursed to us. The lender has agreed to release the Excess Cash within ten days of receipt of a letter of credit in such amount, and the Additional Collateral Deposit cash amounts will be released within 30 days of delivery of a letter of credit in such amount (subject to a 30 day prior notification period). For as long as the cash sweep triggering event period continues, the Corporation must guarantee the Excess Cash of approximately $15.0 million for the remainder of the loan term.

Debt Maturities     
  Future principal payments due on our various types of debt as of   March 31, 2015   (in thousands):  

(1)      The CMBS - fixed-rate payment balance in 2015 includes   $77.4 million   for the acceleration of principal payable following an event of default under four separate CMBS loans. 
  Contractual Obligations    
  There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the information regarding specified contractual obligations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2014  , as filed with the SEC.  
  We may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one-year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.  
  Distribution Policy    
  Distributions from our current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally classified as ordinary income, whereas distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, to the extent of a stockholder s federal income tax basis in our common stock, are generally characterized as a return of capital. Distributions in excess of a stockholder s federal income tax basis in our common stock are generally characterized as capital gain.  
  We are required to distribute 90% of our taxable income (subject to certain adjustments and excluding net capital gain) on an annual basis to maintain qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and are required to pay federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including capital gains).  
  We intend to make distributions that will enable us to meet the distribution requirements applicable to REITs and to eliminate or minimize our obligation to pay corporate-level federal income and excise taxes.  
    
  Any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and their form, timing and amount, if any, will depend upon a number of factors, including our actual and projected results of operations, FFO, liquidity, cash flows and financial condition, the revenue we actually receive from our properties, our operating expenses, our debt service requirements, our capital expenditures, prohibitions and other limitations under our financing arrangements, our REIT taxable income, the annual REIT distribution requirements, applicable law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.

Cash Flows  
  Comparison of   Three Months   Ended   March 31, 2015   to   Three Months   Ended   March 31, 2014    
    
  The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the   three months ended     March 31, 2015   and   March 31, 2014  , respectively: 

As of   March 31, 2015  , we had   $108.1 million   of cash and cash equivalents as compared to   $176.2 million   as of   December 31, 2014  . 
  Operating Activities 
  Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the rental rates specified in our leases, the collectability of rent and the level of our operating expenses and other general and administrative costs. 
  The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in cash revenue of   $14.6 million   and a reduction in cash paid for interest of   $4.9 million   partially offset by   $2.7 million   of debt extinguishment costs and   $2.1 million   in higher property costs.  
  The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisition of 310 properties, representing an investment in real estate during the twelve months ended   March 31, 2015   totaling   $1.08 billion  , offset slightly by property dispositions. The reduction in cash paid for interest is primarily due to the 2014 repayments of $583.8 million of indebtedness, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.41%, offset by 2014 borrowings of $510.0 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.30%. Approximately $1.3 million of the increase in property costs were offset by an increase in tenant reimbursement income. The balance of the increase in property costs was attributable to higher property taxes and utilities due to a rise in the number of vacant properties between periods in addition to property cost recoveries of approximately $0.5 million during the comparable period in 2014.  
  Investing Activities 
  Cash used in investing activities is generally used to fund property acquisitions, for investments in loans receivable and, to a limited extent, for capital expenditures. Cash provided by investing activities generally relates to the disposition of real estate and other assets. 
  Net cash used in investing activities during the   three months ended     March 31, 2015  , included   $265.7 million   to fund the acquisition of   53   properties (  4   of which were acquired through a   $32.5 million   non-cash 1031 Exchange), partially offset by the release of sales proceeds from restricted cash accounts of   $43.4 million  , cash proceeds of   $71.5 million   from the disposition of   15   properties (  6   of which were disposed of through a   $39.4 million   1031 Exchange) and collections of principal on loans receivable and real estate assets under direct financing leases totaling   $1.5 million  .  
  During the same period in   2014  , net cash used in investing activities included   $158.0 million   to fund the acquisition of   104   properties (  14   which were acquired through a   $20.8 million   non-cash 1031 Exchange) and transfers of sales proceeds to restricted cash accounts of   $6.3 million   partially offset by proceeds from property dispositions of   $6.2 million   and collections of principal on loans receivable and real estate assets under direct financing leases of   $1.3 million  .  
  
   57 

Financing Activities 
  Generally, our net cash provided by financing activities is impacted by our borrowings and common stock offerings, including sales of our common stock under our ATM Program and issuances of net-lease mortgage notes under our Spirit Master Funding Program. 
  Net cash provided by financing activities during the   three months ended     March 31, 2015  , was primarily attributable to net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities of   $169.9 million  , which was used mostly to extinguish   $162.8 million     of higher cost senior mortgage indebtedness.     During the   three months ended     March 31, 2015  , we sold   6.6 million   shares of our common stock under our ATM Program for net proceeds of   $78.6 million  . This amount was partially offset by dividends paid to equity owners of   $70.0 million  , which were paid primarily through sources from our operating cash flows.  
  During the same period in   2014  , net cash provided by financing activities was comprised of net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities of   $180.5 million   and net borrowings of mortgages and notes payable of   $10.0 million  , partially offset by repayment of our indebtedness of   $94.2 million   and dividends paid to equity owners of   $61.6 million  . 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
  FFO and AFFO 
  We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and losses (gains) from property dispositions. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. We use FFO as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions and impairment charges, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of equity REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other equity REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and does not capture the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other equity REITs  FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance.  
  AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. It adjusts FFO to eliminate the impact of non-recurring items that are not reflective of ongoing operations and certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP. Our computation of AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and, therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) to AFFO is included in the financial information accompanying this report. 
  FFO and AFFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions or service indebtedness. FFO and AFFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) to FFO and AFFO is included in the financial information accompanying this report. 
  Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA modified to include other adjustments to GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for real estate acquisition costs, impairment losses, gains/losses from the sale of real estate and debt transactions and other items that are not considered to be indicative of our on-going operating performance. We exclude these items as they are not key drivers in our investment decision making process. We focus our business plans to enable us to sustain increasing shareholder value.  Accordingly, we believe that excluding these items, which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income, but are not indicative of overall long-term operating performance, provides a useful supplemental measure to investors and analysts in assessing the net earnings contribution of our real estate portfolio. Because these measures do not represent net income (loss) that is computed in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or as an indicator of financial performance.   
  
   58 

Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by multiplying Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter by four. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the methodology used by other equity REITs to calculate these measures, and, therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is included in the financial information accompanying this report. 
  Adjusted Debt and Leverage   
  Adjusted Debt represents interest bearing debt (reported in accordance with GAAP) adjusted to include preferred stock and exclude unamortized debt discount/premium and deferred financing costs, as further reduced for cash and cash equivalents and cash collateral deposits retained by lenders. We believe that including preferred stock in Adjusted Debt is appropriate because it is an equity security that has properties of a debt instrument not possessed by common stock.  Additionally, by excluding unamortized debt discount/premium and deferred financing costs, cash and cash equivalents, and cash collateral deposits retained by lenders, the result provides an estimate of the contractual amount of borrowed capital to be repaid which we believe is a beneficial disclosure to investors.     
  Leverage is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate the level of borrowed capital being used to increase the potential return of our real estate investments. We calculate Leverage by dividing Adjusted Debt by Annualized Adjusted EBITDA. The utility of Leverage should be considered as a supplemental measure of the level of risk that stockholder value may be exposed to. Our computation of Leverage may differ from the methodology used by other equity REITs, and, therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of interest bearing debt (reported in accordance with GAAP) to Adjusted Debt is included in the financial information accompanying this report. 
  Initial Cash Yield 
    
  We calculate initial cash yield from properties by dividing the annualized first month base rent (excluding any future rent escalations provided for in the lease) by the gross acquisition cost of the related properties. Gross acquisition cost for an acquired property includes the contracted purchase price and any related capitalized costs. Initial cash yield is a measure (expressed as a percentage) of the base rent expected to be earned on an acquired property in the first year. Because it excludes any future rent increases or additional rent that may be contractually provided for in the lease, as well as any other income or fees that may be earned from lease modifications or asset dispositions, initial cash yield does not represent the annualized investment rate of return of our acquired properties. Additionally, actual base rent earned from the properties acquired may differ from the initial cash yield based on other factors, including difficulties collecting anticipated rental revenues and unanticipated expenses at these properties that we cannot pass on to tenants, as well as the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2014  .

FFO and AFFO 
    
  The following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) (which we believe is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO and AFFO.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
  As of   March 31, 2015  , we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We are exposed to financial market risks, especially interest rate risk. Interest rates and other factors, such as occupancy, rental rate and the financial condition of our tenants, influence our performance more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. As described above, we generally offer leases that provide for payments of base rent with scheduled increases, based on a fixed amount or the lesser of a multiple of the increase in the CPI over a specified period term or fixed percentage and, to a lesser extent, contingent rent based on a percentage of the tenant s gross sales to help mitigate the effect of inflation. Because the properties in our portfolio are generally leased to tenants under triple-net leases, where the tenant is responsible for property operating costs and expenses, our exposure to rising property operating costs due to inflation is mitigated.  
  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and global economic and political conditions, and other factors which are beyond our control. Our operating results will depend heavily on the difference between the revenue from our assets and the interest expense incurred on our borrowings. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future, including amounts that we may borrow under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate due to a reduction in desirable alternative income-producing investments. Increased competition for the acquisition of real estate may lead to a decrease in the yields on real estate we have targeted for acquisition. In such circumstances, if we are not able to offset the decrease in yields by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to acquire real estate with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings.  
  In the event interest rates rise significantly or there is an economic downturn, defaults may increase and result in credit losses, which may adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. In a decreasing interest rate environment, borrowers are generally more likely to prepay their loans in order to obtain financing at lower interest rates. However, the vast majority of our mortgage notes payable have prepayment clauses that make refinancing during a decreasing interest rate environment uneconomical. Investments in our mortgage loans receivable, however, have significant prepayment protection in the form of yield maintenance provisions, which provide us with substantial yield protection in a decreasing interest rate environment with respect to this portion of our investment portfolio.   
  The objective of our interest rate risk management policy is to match fund fixed-rate assets with fixed-rate liabilities and variable-rate assets with variable-rate liabilities. As of   March 31, 2015  , our assets were primarily long-term, fixed-rate leases (though most have scheduled rental increases during the terms of the leases). As of   March 31, 2015  , approximately   $3.49 billion   of our indebtedness consisted of long-term, fixed-rate obligations. As of   March 31, 2015  , the weighted average stated interest rate of our CMBS and Master Trust Notes, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts/premiums, was approximately   5.38%  .  
  We intend to continue our practice of employing interest rate derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps and futures, to reduce our exposure, on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis, to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate changes. We do not intend to enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We generally intend to utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on our liabilities and not use derivatives for other purposes, such as hedging asset-related risks. Hedging transactions, however, may generate income which is not qualified income for purposes of maintaining our REIT status. We intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a REIT.  
  Even with hedging strategies in place, there can be no assurance that our results of operations will remain unaffected as a result of changes in interest rates. In addition, hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve additional risks such as counterparty credit risk and basis risk. Basis risk in a hedging contract occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset or liability is based, thereby making the hedge less effective. We address basis risk by matching, to a reasonable extent, the contract index to the index upon which the hedged asset or liability is based. Our interest rate risk management policy addresses counterparty credit risk (the risk of nonperformance by counterparties) by requiring that we deal only with major financial institutions that we deem credit worthy.

The estimated fair values of our revolving credit facilities, fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgages and notes payable and Convertible Notes have been derived based on market quotes for comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analysis using estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows, market rates and credit spreads.  
  The following table discloses the fair value information for these financial instruments as of   March 31, 2015   (in thousands):  

(1)    The carrying value of the debt instruments are net of unamortized deferred financing costs and certain debt discounts. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
    
  Prior to the filing of the Original Filing, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of March 31, 2015. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.  
  As disclosed in Item 9A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed concurrently with this Form 10-Q/A, the Company failed to design controls over the review of the accounting for real estate asset dispositions; specifically, the allocation of a portion of the Company's goodwill to the carrying amount of assets sold or held for sale when determining the gain or loss on sale to be recognized for sold assets or the amount, if any, of impairment losses to be recognized for assets held for sale.  
  Management became aware of this material weakness in internal control over financial reporting and took immediate actions to remediate the material weakness.  The Company will initiate robust controls over the proper application of GAAP in accounting for goodwill related to the disposal of assets and in allocating goodwill to held for sale assets in determining the amount, if any, for impairment charges. The Company currently expects to have this material weakness remediated no later than December 31, 2016. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
    
  Except as noted in the preceding paragraph, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended   March 31, 2015   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
