     NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 (Unaudited)  
   
 1. Basis of Presentation  
 The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements represent Essendant Inc. ( ESND ) with its wholly owned subsidiary Essendant Co. ( ECO ), and ECO s subsidiaries (collectively,  Essendant  or the  Company ). The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of ESND and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company operates in a single reportable segment as a leading distributor of workplace essentials.  
 The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015, was derived from the December 31, 2015 audited financial statements. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Accordingly, the reader of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K )  for further information.  
 In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position of Essendant at September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 should not necessarily be taken as indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the entire year.  
 New Accounting Pronouncements  
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  that outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The ASU is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the new standard. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
   
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) ,  that requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases other than those that meet the definition of short-term leases. For short-term leases, lessees may elect an accounting policy by class of underlying asset under which these assets and liabilities are not recognized and lease payments are generally recognized over the lease term on a straight-line basis. This standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . Under the new guidance, when awards vest or are settled, companies are required to record excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement instead of in additional paid-in capital (APIC). This guidance will be applied prospectively. Furthermore, companies will present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity, which companies can elect to apply retrospectively or prospectively. Under the new guidance, companies will elect whether to account for forfeitures of share-based payments by recognizing forfeitures of awards as they occur or estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited, as is currently required. This guidance will be applied using a modified retrospective transition method, with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. The standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.

    Inventory   
 Approximately 98.4% of total inventory as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, has been valued under the LIFO method. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each fiscal year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Interim LIFO calculations are based on management s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs, and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation.  Inventory valued under the LIFO accounting method is recorded at the lower of cost or market. If the Company had valued its entire inventory under the lower of FIFO cost or market, inventory values would have been $147.2 million and $147.8 million higher than reported as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
 The change in the LIFO reserve in the third quarter of 2016 included a LIFO liquidation relating to decrements in five of the Company s thirteen LIFO pools. These decrements resulted in liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs in prior years as compared with the cost of current year purchases. This liquidation resulted in LIFO income of $2.3 million which was partially offset by LIFO expense of $2.1 million related to current inflation for an overall net decrease in cost of sales of $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the change in the method of inventory costing resulted in LIFO income of $3.5 million which was partially offset by LIFO expense of $0.8 million related to inflation for an overall net decrease in cost of sales of $2.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the LIFO income of $2.3 million related to the liquidation was more than offset by LIFO expense of $3.2 million related to current inflation for an overall net increase in cost of sales of $0.9 million. 
   
 2. Acquisitions  
 Nestor Sales LLC 
 On July 31, 2015, Essendant Co. completed the acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of Nestor Sales LLC ( Nestor ), a leading wholesaler and distributor of tools, equipment and supplies to the transportation industry.  This acquisition accelerates the Company s growth in the automotive aftermarket, complements the Company s existing industrial offerings while providing access to new customer segments.  
 The purchase price was $41.8 million. This acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and cash available under the Company s revolving credit facility. Purchase accounting for this transaction was completed as of June 30, 2016.   
 At September 30, 2016, the allocation of the purchase price was as follows (amounts in thousands):  

The purchased identifiable intangible assets were as follows (amounts in thousands):

3.  Sale-Leaseback  On September 23, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale and leaseback of its facility in City of Industry, CA. The agreement provided for the sale of the facility for a purchase price of $31.7 million and the subsequent leaseback for a two year period. The lease is classified as an operating lease. As a result, the Company recorded a gain of $20.5 million in  warehousing, marketing and administrative expenses.  A deferred gain of approximately $2.8 million that will be amortized into income over the term of the lease was also recorded.  As of September 30, 2016, $1.4 million of the deferred gain is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet under  other long-term liabilities , with the remainder included as a component of  other current liabilities .  The cash proceeds from the sale were used primarily to pay down long-term debt.   
   
 4. Share-Based Compensation  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company has two active equity compensation plans. Under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended and restated), award instruments include, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units ( RSUs ), and performance-based awards. Associates and non-employee directors of the Company are eligible to become participants in the plan. The Nonemployee Directors  Deferred Stock Compensation Plan allows non-employee directors to elect to defer receipt of all or a portion of their annual retainer in deferred stock units.  
 The Company granted 526,697   shares of restricted stock and 290,725 RSUs during the first nine months of 2016, compared to 440,948 shares of restricted stock and 162,092 RSUs during the first nine months of 2015.  
   
 5. Severance and Restructuring Charges  
   
 Commencing in the first quarter of 2015, the Company began certain restructuring actions which included workforce reductions and facility closures. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company executed actions to reduce costs through management delayering in order to achieve broader functional alignment of the organization. The charges associated with these actions were included in  warehousing, marketing and administrative expenses.  
   
 The expenses, cash flows, and accrued liabilities associated with the restructuring actions described above are noted in the following table (in thousands):

    The following table details the amounts reclassified out of AOCI into the income statement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016      (in thousan  ds):   

8. Earnings Per Share  
 Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised into common stock. Stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and deferred stock units are considered dilutive securities. For the three-month period ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, 0.3 and 0.4 million shares of such securities, respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would be antidilutive. For the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016, 0.3 million shares of securities were excluded from the computation. For the nine-month period September 30, 2015, no shares of securities were excluded from the computation. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data):

    Common Stock Repurchases   
 As of September 30, 2016 , the Company had Board authorization to repurchase $68.2 million of common stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. For the same period in the prior year, the Company repurchased 744,081 shares at an aggregate cost of $25.9 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company repurchased 241,270 and 1,525,222 shares of the Company s common stock at an aggregate cost of $6.8 million and $57.4 million, respectively. Depending on market and business conditions and other factors, the Company may continue or suspend purchasing its common stock at any time without notice. Acquired shares are included in the issued shares of the Company and treasury stock, but are not included in average shares outstanding when calculating earnings per share data. During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, the Company reissued 452,286 and 369,591 shares, respectively, of treasury stock to fulfill its obligations under its equity incentive plans.  
   
 9. Debt  
 ESND is a holding company and, as a result, its primary sources of funds are cash generated from operating activities of its direct operating subsidiary, ECO, and from borrowings by ECO. The 2013 Credit Agreement, the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement, and the Receivables Securitization Program (each as defined in Note 11 of the 2015 Form 10-K) (each a  Lending Agreement ) contain restrictions on the use of cash transferred from ECO to ESND. Each of the Lending Agreements also prohibits the Company from exceeding a Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2013 Credit Agreement and the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement). The maximum Leverage Ratio is 3.50 to 1.00 but increases to up to 4.00 to 1.00 for the first four fiscal quarters (the  Adjusted Leverage Period ) following certain acquisitions. Following the 2015 acquisition of Nestor Sales, an Adjusted Leverage period was applicable through the quarter ended June 30, 2016. On August 30, 2016, the Lending Agreements were amended to extend the Adjusted Leverage Period for two additional quarters. As a result, the maximum permitted Leverage Ratio remains at 4.00 to 1.00 but will revert to 3.50 to 1.00 for the quarter ending March 31, 2017. 
 Debt consisted of the following amounts (in millions):  

As of September 30, 2016, 75.9% of the Company s outstanding debt, excluding capital leases and transaction costs, was priced at variable interest rates based primarily on the applicable bank prime rate or London InterBank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ).  
 The Company had outstanding letters of credit of $11.2 million and $11.6 million under the 2013 Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the applicable margin under the 2013 Credit Agreement was   2.00% for LIBOR-based loans and was 1.00% for Alternate Base Rate loans. Interest under the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement is payable semi-annually at a rate per annum equal to 3.75% (3.66% after the effect of terminating an interest rate swap),  except the annual rate increases by 0.625% if the Company s Leverage Ratio is between 3.50 to 1.00 and 3.75 to 1.00, and increases by 0.75% if the Leverage Ratio is between 3.75 to 1.00 and 4.00 to 1.00. The Company s Leverage Ratio was 3.51 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2016 and was 2.77 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2016.  
   
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $552.9 million and $448.6 million, respectively, of receivables had been sold to the Investors (as defined in Note 11 to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Form 10-K). Essendant Receivables LLC had $200.0 million outstanding under the Receivables Securitization Program as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
   
 For additional information about the 2013 Credit Agreement, the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement, and the Receivables Securitization Program, see Note 11 of the 2015 Form 10-K.  

12 
 
    10  . Pension and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans   
 The Company maintains pension plans covering union and certain non-union employees. For more information on the Company s retirement plans, see Note 13 to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statement in the 2015 Form 10-K. A summary of net periodic pension cost related to the Company s pension plans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows (dollars in thousands):  

The Company made cash contributions of $10.0 million and $2.0 million to its pension plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additional contributions, if any, for 2016 have not yet been determined. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the Company had accrued $44.7 million and $48.4 million of pension liability within  Other long-term liabilities  on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
   
 During 2016, the Company has taken several actions to mitigate the interest rate, mortality and investment risks of the Essendant Pension Plan. These actions include  a limited-time voluntary lump-sum pension offering to eligible, terminated, vested plan participants  that was completed during the second quarter. 
   
 As a result of the lump sum offer, a settlement and remeasurement of the Essendant Pension Plan was performed. The remeasurement and activity in the first nine months of 2016 had no cash impact to the Company since the payments were made by the Essendant Pension Trust, and resulted in a $1.5 million improvement to the net funded status of the plan, therefore reducing other long-term liabilities. However, the settlement caused a loss of $12.2 million, which was partially offset by the $8.4 million reduction in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income related to the unrecognized actuarial loss, for a net impact on shareholders  equity of $3.8 million as of September 30, 2016 when compared to December 31, 2015. This offer also reduces future pension expense recognized by the Company and volatility related to future obligations of the plan.  
   Defined Contribution Plan   
 The Company has defined contribution plans covering certain salaried associates and non-union hourly paid associates (the  Plan ). The Plan permits associates to defer a portion of their pre-tax and after-tax salary as contributions to the Plan. The Plan also provides for Company-funded discretionary contributions as well as matching associates  salary deferral contributions, at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company recorded expense of $1.8 million and $5.5 million, respectively, for the Company match of employee contributions to the Plan for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the same periods last year, the Company recorded expense of $1.5 million and $4.4 million to match employee contributions.

    11. Fair Value Measurements   
 The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities, including interest rate swap and foreign currency derivatives, at fair value on a recurring basis, based on market rates of the Company s positions and other observable interest rates. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined by using quoted market forward rates (level 2 inputs) and reflects the present value of the amount the Company would pay for contracts involving the same notional amount and maturity date.  The fair value of the foreign currency cash flow hedge is determined by using quoted market spot rates (level 2 inputs). 
 Accounting guidance on fair value establishes a hierarchy for those instruments measured at fair value which distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:  

Level 1 Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;      

Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and      

Level 3 Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions developed by the Company which reflect those that a market participant would use.      

 Determining which level to apply to an asset or liability requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. The following table summarizes the financial instruments measured at fair value in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):

The carrying amount of accounts receivable at September 30, 2016, including $552.9 million of receivables sold under the Receivables Securitization Program, approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of this item.  
 No assets or liabilities were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 
   
 12. Other Assets and Liabilities  
 Receivables related to supplier allowances totaling $93.4 million and $111.0 million were included in  Accounts receivable  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 Accrued customer rebates of $64.3 million and $63.6 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were included in  Accrued liabilities  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

13. Income Taxes 
 The Company's tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items.  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded income tax expense of $17.1 million and $34.9 million on pre-tax income of $53.8 million and $101.1 million, for an effective tax rate of 31.8% and 34.5%, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded income tax expense of $20.0 million and $42.6 million on pre-tax income of $47.7 million and $94.1 million, for an effective tax rate of  42.0% and 45.3%, respectively.  
   
 The Company s U.S. statutory rate is 35.0%. The most significant factor impacting the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was the discrete tax impact of the payment of a dividend from a foreign subsidiary. The most significant factors impacting the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were the discrete tax impacts of the impairment charges and the establishment of a valuation allowance on a capital loss asset for financial reporting purposes related to selling a non-strategic business in the third quarter. 
   
 14. Legal Matters 
   
 The Company has been named as a defendant in two lawsuits alleging that the Company sent unsolicited fax advertisements to the named plaintiffs, as well as other persons and entities, in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, as amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005 ("TCPA"). One lawsuit was initially filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on May 1, 2015 and has been dismissed without prejudice and refiled in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The other lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on January 14, 2016.  In both lawsuits the plaintiffs filed a motion asking the Court to certify a class of plaintiffs comprised of persons and entities who allegedly received fax advertisements from the Company.  Under the TCPA, recipients of unsolicited fax advertisements can seek damages of $500 per fax for inadvertent violations and up to $1,500 per fax for knowing and willful violations.   Other reported TCPA lawsuits have resulted in a broad range of outcomes, with each case being dependent on its own unique set of facts and circumstances.  In each lawsuit, the Company is vigorously contesting class certification and denies that any violations occurred.  Litigation of this kind, however, is likely to lead to settlement negotiations, including negotiations prompted by pre-trial civil court procedures.  Regardless of whether the lawsuits are resolved at trial or through settlement, the Company believes that a loss associated with resolution of pending claims is probable.  However, the amount of any such loss, which could be material, cannot be reasonably estimated because the Company is continuing to evaluate its defenses based on its internal review and investigation of prior events, new information and future circumstances.    
 The Company is also involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of or incidental to its business. The Company has established reserves, which are not material, for potential losses that are probable and reasonably estimable that may result from those proceedings. In many cases, however, it is difficult to determine whether a loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount or range of potential loss, particularly where proceedings may be in relatively early stages or where plaintiffs are seeking substantial or indeterminate damages. Matters frequently need to be more developed before a loss or range of loss can reasonably be estimated. The Company believes that such ordinary course legal proceedings will be resolved with no material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations.

Key Trends and Recent Results  
 The following is a summary of selected trends, events or uncertainties that the Company believes may have a significant impact on its future performance.  
   
  Third Quarter Results   

Third quarter net sales increased 1.1%, from the prior-year quarter to $1.4 billion.      

Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were $138.5 million or 9.8% of net sales, compared with $172.2 million or 12.4% of net sales in the prior-year quarter, including impacts of the Company s Actions impacting comparability of results (collectively, the  Actions ) discussed below. Adjusted operating expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were $158.6 million or 11.3% of net sales compared to $158.6 million or 11.4% of net sales in the prior-year quarter. Refer to the Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow table (the  Non-GAAP table ) included later in this section for more detail.          

Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 increased to $0.99 from $0.74 in the prior year quarter, including the impacts of the Actions discussed below. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.57 compared with $1.00 in the prior-year period.     

o   
 
  Inventory decreased $73.7 million compared to a decrease of $54.4 million in the prior year.      

o   
 
  Accounts payable increased $8.9 million compared to an increase of $50.4 million in the prior year.     

o   
 
  Dealer rebate prepayments increased $34.5 million compared to an increase of $10.8 million in the prior year.     

Cash flow provided by investing activities improved $63.5 million compared to the prior year due to proceeds of $31.0 million from the 2016 sale of our City of Industry facility. In addition, there were no acquisitions in 2016 compared to acquisitions totaling $40.5 million in the prior year.     

Actions impacting comparability of results (the  Actions )  

In the third quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a two-year operating lease agreement in connection with the disposition of its City of Industry facility. The sale of the facility resulted in a $20.5 million gain. Refer to Note 3 for further details of this transaction.      

In the third quarter of 2016, the Company incurred charges of $1.2 million related to severance costs for two members of the Company s operating leadership team.      

A voluntary lump-sum pension offering was completed in the second quarter of 2016 and resulted in a significant reduction of interest rate, mortality and investment risk of the Essendant Pension Plan. Due to this offer, a settlement and remeasurement of the Essendant Pension Plan was required as of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, resulting in a defined benefit plan settlement loss of $0.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Refer to Note 10  Pension and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans , for further information on the remeasurement and voluntary lump sum program.      

Restructuring actions were taken in 2015 to improve our operational utilization, labor spend, inventory performance and functional alignment of the organization. This included workforce reductions and facility consolidations with an unfavorable impact of $0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015 and an unfavorable $6.5 million in the first nine months of 2015. In the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the impact of these actions totaled a favorable $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, due to the release of severance accruals.      

On June 1, 2015, we officially rebranded the Company to Essendant Inc. to communicate the Company s strategy in a consistent manner. When we announced in the first quarter of 2015 our decision to rebrand the company, the ORS Nasco trademark and certain OKI brands were determined to be impaired. Pre-tax, non-cash, impairment charges and accelerated amortization totaling $11.5 million were recorded in the first nine months of 2015.      

In the third quarter of 2015, seller notes receivable of $10.7 million related to the 2014 sale of the Company s software service provider were impaired.      

In 2015 we exited non-strategic channels to further align our product categories and channels with our strategies, including the sale of Azerty de Mexico, our operations in Mexico. The total charges in the first nine months of 2015 related to the disposition of this subsidiary were $17.0 million. In the first nine months of 2015, this subsidiary had net sales of $50.1 million and operating loss of $0.8 million, excluding the charges previously mentioned.     

17 

Guidance  
 The Company revised its guidance regarding 2016, and currently expects the following: 

Adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. A quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP guidance to the corresponding GAAP information is not available because the non-GAAP guidance excludes certain GAAP information that is uncertain and difficult to predict.  
 The adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance excludes income in the first nine months of 2016 of $0.22 per share related to a settlement charge for the defined benefit plan, gain on sale of City of Industry facility, severance costs for operating leadership, restructuring charges, and non-GAAP tax provision. Actual amounts for these measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 appear in the Non-GAAP table included later in this section. For the remainder of the year, the factors that will be excluded are currently unknown due to the level of unpredictability and uncertainty associated with these items, but may include actions such as gain or loss on future sales of assets or businesses, future restructuring charges, non-GAAP tax adjustments, cash flow impacts of acquisitions, and other actions.  
 For a further discussion of selected trends, events or uncertainties the Company believes may have a significant impact on its future performance, readers should refer to  Key Trends and Recent Results  under Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the 2015 Form 10-K.  
   
 Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates  
 In the third quarter of 2016, there were no significant changes to the Company s critical accounting policies, judgments or estimates from those disclosed in the 2015 Form 10-K. 

18 

Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnin  gs Per Share, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow (the  Non-GAAP table )  
 The Non-GAAP table below presents Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except per share data). These non-GAAP measures exclude certain non-recurring items and exclude other items that do not reflect the Company s ongoing operations and are included to provide investors with useful information about the financial performance of our business. The presented non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and these non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.  
 In order to calculate the non-GAAP measures, management excludes the following items to facilitate the comparison of current and prior year results and ongoing operations, as management believes these items do not reflect the underlying cost structure of our business. These items can vary significantly in amount and frequency. 

Restructuring charges.   Workforce reduction and facility closure charges such as employee termination costs, facility closure and consolidation costs, and other costs directly associated with shifting business strategies or business conditions that are part of a restructuring program.       

 The Company commenced two such restructuring programs during 2015 (refer to Note 5). 

Gain or loss on sale of assets or businesses.    Sales of assets, such as buildings or equipment, and businesses can cause gains or losses. These transactions occur as the Company is repositioning its business and reviewing its cost structure.       

 The Company recognized a gain on the sale of its City of Industry facility in the third quarter of 2016 (refer to Note 3), a loss on the sale and related impairment of intangible assets of the operations in Mexico in 2015, and a loss on the sale and related impairment of intangible assets of its software subsidiary in 2014, recording an impairment of the seller notes in the third quarter of 2015. 
 Due to the sale of the City of Industry facility, the Company was able to utilize its capital loss carryforwards. This utilization resulted in the release of the valuation allowance previously established against the deferred tax asset. The $5.0 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance reduced the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, by 9.2% and 4.9%, respectively.   

Severance costs for operating leadership.    Employee termination costs related to members of the Company s operating leadership team are excluded as they are based upon individual agreements.       

 Two operating leaders were severed from the Company in the third quarter of 2016, which were not part of a restructuring program. 

Asset impairments.    Changes in strategy or macroeconomic events may cause asset impairments.       

 The Company recorded impairment and accelerated amortization of its trademarks upon the announcement of its rebranding effort in 2015. 

Other actions  .  Actions, which may be non-recurring events, that result from the changing strategies and needs of the Company and do not reflect the underlying expense of the on-going business. These charges include items such as settlement charges related to the defined benefit plan settlement in 2016 (refer to Note 10) and the tax impact of the dividend from a foreign subsidiary (refer to Note 13).     

 Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income . Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income provide management and our investors with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of items described above that do not reflect the ordinary expenses and earnings of our operations. Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income are used to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance as they are more comparable measures of our continuing business. These measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business.  
 Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share.  Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share provide a more comparable view of our Company s underlying performance and trends than the comparable GAAP measures. Net income and diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the effect of items described above that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations.   
 19 

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)  . Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in e  valuating our operating performance and is used by management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. Net income is adjusted for the effect of interest, taxes, depreciation and amor  tization and stock-based compensation expense. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA is also commonly used by investors to evaluate operating performance between competitors because it helps reduce variability caused by differences in capital structures  , income taxes, stock-based compensation accounting policies, and depreciation and amortization policies.    
 Free cash flow.  Free cash flow is useful to management and our investors as it is a measure of the Company s liquidity. It provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows than the comparable GAAP measure. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and net cash provided by (used in) investing activities are aggregated and adjusted to exclude the non-cash impact of acquisitions and divestitures.

Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015        
 Net Sales.  Net sales for the third quarter of 2016 were $1.4 billion. The following table summarizes net sales by product category for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):   

(1)   
 
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Such changes include reclassification of specific products to different product categories and did not impact the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. All percentage presentations described below are based on the reclassified amounts.     

 Net sales in the janitorial and breakroom supplies (JanSan) product category decreased 1.3% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. This category accounted for 26.5% of the Company s second quarter 2016 consolidated net sales. Sales in this category declined due to lower volumes in independent distributor channels. 
 Net sales in the technology products category (primarily ink and toner) increased 0.7% from the third quarter of 2015. This category accounted for 24.6% of net sales for the third quarter of 2016. Excluding our Mexican subsidiary, which was sold in the third quarter of 2015, net sales in this category increased 3.2% compared to the prior year quarter, which was driven by sales to new customers. 
 Net sales of traditional office products increased in the third quarter of 2016 by 1.6% versus the third quarter of 2015. Traditional office supplies represented 17.0% of the Company s consolidated net sales for the third quarter of 2016. The sales increase was driven by an increase in sales in independent dealer channels as we have increased our share in this channel with new key customer acquisitions.  
 Industrial supplies net sales in the third quarter of 2016 decreased by 4.7% compared to the same prior-year period. Net sales of industrial supplies accounted for 9.9% of the Company s net sales for the third quarter of 2016. Growth in retail channel sales partially offset the decline in industrial supplies net sales driven by challenges in the oilfield and welding sector and macro-economic environment.  
 Net sales in the cut sheet paper category increased in the third quarter of 2016 by 27.6% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Cut sheet paper net sales accounted for 7.6% of the Company s net sales for the third quarter of 2016. The increase in this category was driven by increased sales in the independent dealer channels. 
 Automotive net sales in the third quarter of 2016 increased 3.9% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Automotive net sales represented 5.6% of the Company s third quarter of 2016 net sales. This increase was due to the acquisition of Nestor which contributed an additional $3.8 million in net sales in the third quarter of 2016.  
 Office furniture net sales in the third quarter of 2016 decreased 6.3% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Office furniture accounted for 5.8% of the Company s third quarter of 2016 consolidated net sales. This decline was due to declines in sales in national accounts and independent dealer channels. 
 The remainder of the Company s third quarter 2016 net sales were composed of freight and other revenues.  
   
 23 

Gross Profit and Gross Margin Rate.   Gross profit for the third quarter of 2016 was $19  8.9 million, compared to $225.1 million in the third quarter of 2015. The gross margin rate of 14.1% was down 210 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter gross margin rate of 16.2%. Our gross margin declined primarily due to reduced supplier allowan  ces related to inventory reductions and customer and product mix. We also experienced higher freight cost due to new sales and growth of larger customers, and inventory expense increase due to the 2015 favorability related to a LIFO conversion.   Our sales t  o larger resellers are generally at lower margins than sales to our smaller resellers. Sales to new customers tend to be lower margin but mature over time. Lower margin categories of sales include cut-sheet paper and technology, while JanSan office product  s, furniture and industrial are higher margin categories.  
 Operating Expenses.  Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2016 were $138.5 million or 9.8% of net sales, compared to $172.2 million or 12.4% of net sales in the prior year. The $33.7 million decline was driven by the gain on sale of the City of Industry facility (refer to Note 3) as well as the impairment of seller notes in 2015. Adjusted operating expenses were $158.6 million or 11.3% of net sales compared with $158.6 million or 11.4% of net sales in the same period last year, reflecting the recognition of previously capitalized costs related to inventory reduction and incremental variable labor costs, offset by actions to reduce salary expense, discretionary spend and lower incentive compensation. We expect to realize future savings through continued rationalization of our distribution center network, realization of process improvements in our distribution centers and our infrastructure, and optimization of our fleet and delivery structure to match the changing business that we are supporting.   
 Interest Expense, net.  Interest expense, net for the third quarter of 2016 was $6.5 million compared to $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2015. This was driven by higher debt outstanding related to our acquisitions in the past year. Interest expense is expected to be higher in 2016 than in the prior year.  
 Income Taxes.  Income tax expense was $17.1 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared with $20.0 million for the same period in 2015. The Company s effective tax rate was 31.8% for the current-year quarter and 42.0% for the same period in 2015.  
 Net Income.   Net income for the third quarter of 2016 increased to $36.7 million or $0.99 per diluted share, compared to $27.7 million or $0.74 per diluted share in the prior year. Adjusted net income was $20.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared with adjusted net income of $37.7 million or $1.00 per diluted share for the same three-month period in 2015.  
 Results of Operations  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015     
 Net Sales.  Net sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 were $4.1 billion. The following table summarizes net sales by product category for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):   

(1)   
 
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Such changes include reclassification of specific products to different product categories and did not impact the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. All percentage presentations described below are based on the reclassified amounts.     

 Sales in the janitorial and breakroom supplies product category in the first nine months of 2016 were comparable to the first nine months of 2015. This category accounted for 26.8% of the Company s first nine months of 2016 consolidated net sales. Sales in this category declined due to lower volumes in independent distributor channels. 
 Sales in the technology products category (primarily ink and toner) decreased in the first nine months of 2016 by 0.7% versus the first nine months of 2015. This category accounted for 25.2% of net sales for the first nine months of 2016. Excluding our Mexican subsidiary, which was sold in the third quarter of 2015, net sales in this category increased 4.3% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by sales to new e-tailers and technology customers. 
 24 

Sales of traditional office products increased in the first nine months of 2016 by 2.2% versus the first nine months of 2015. Traditional office suppl  ies represented 16.3% of the Company s consolidated net sales for the first nine months of 2016. The improvement in this category was primarily driven by increased sales in independent dealer channels as we have increased our share in this channel with new   key customer acquisitions.  
 Industrial supplies sales in the first nine months of 2016 decreased by 5.0% compared to the same prior-year period and accounted for 10.3% of the Company s net sales for the first nine months of 2016. Industrial supplies sales declined due to impacts of our general industrial and energy channels. We expect this impact to continue throughout the year. 
 Net sales in the cut sheet paper category increased in the first nine months of 2016 by 15.9% compared to the first nine months of 2015. Cut sheet paper net sales accounted for 7.2% of the Company s net sales for the first nine months of 2016. The increase in this category was driven by increased sales in the independent dealer channels. 
 Automotive net sales in the first nine months of 2016 increased 19.4% compared to the same prior-year period. Automotive net sales represented 5.8% of the Company s net sales for the first nine months of 2016. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Nestor which contributed an additional $38.9 million in net sales.  
 Office furniture sales in the first nine months of 2016 decreased 5.6% compared to the first nine months of 2015. Office furniture accounted for 5.6% of the Company s first nine months of 2016 consolidated net sales. The decline in this category was primarily driven by national account and independent dealer channels sales decreases. 
 The remainder of the Company s first nine months of 2016 net sales was composed of freight and other revenues.  
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin Rate.  Gross profit for the first nine months of 2016 was $594.8 million, compared to $635.7 million in the first nine months of 2015. The gross margin rate of 14.5% was down 110 bps from the prior-year period gross margin rate of 15.6%. This decrease was primarily due to product margin, driven by customer and product mix, and higher freight expenses.  
 Operating Expenses.  Operating expenses for the first nine months of 2016 were $475.6 million or 11.6% of sales, compared with $526.7 million or 13.0% of sales in the same period last year. The improvement was due to the gain on sale of City of Industry facility (see Note 3) as well as the impairment of seller notes in 2015. Adjusted operating expenses were $483.7 million or 11.8% of net sales and $480.9 million or 11.8% of net sales in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
 Interest Expense, net.  Interest expense, net for the first nine months of 2016 was $18.1 million compared to $14.9 million in the first nine months of 2015. This was driven by higher debt outstanding related to our acquisitions in the past year. Interest expense is expected to be higher in 2016 than in the prior year.  
 Income Taxes.  Income tax expense was $34.9 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared with $42.6 million for the same period in 2015. The Company s effective tax rate was 34.5% for the current-year period and 45.3% for the same period in 2015.   
 Net Income.  Net income for the first nine months of 2016 totaled $66.2 million or $1.79 per diluted share, including $8.3 million after-tax, or $0.22 per diluted share, of income related to the Actions. For the same period in the prior year, net income was $51.5 million or $1.35 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the first nine months of 2016 was $57.9 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, compared with adjusted net income of $86.3 million or $2.26 per diluted share for the same nine-month period in 2015.   
 Pension Settlement  
   Defined benefit plan settlement loss of $0.4 million and $12.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, resulted from the voluntary lump sum program announced in February 2016. Refer to Note 10  Pension and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans , for further information on the remeasurement and voluntary lump sum program.

Cash Flows   
 The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  
 Operating Activities  
   
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 totaled $106.0 million, compared with $183.7 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. A decrease in inventory of $73.7 million compared to a decrease of $54.4 million in the prior year, an increase in accounts payable of $8.9 million compared to an increase of $50.4 million in the prior year, and an increase in dealer prepayments of $34.5 million compared to an increase of $10.8 million in the prior year were the primary drivers of the $77.7 million decrease. 
 Investing Activities  
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the first nine months of 2016 was $5.7 million, compared with $57.8 million used in investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. The $63.5 million change was primarily driven by $31.0 million proceeds from the sale of our City of Industry facility in 2016 compared with $40.5 million cash used in our acquisition activity in 2015.  
 Financing Activities  
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 totaled $119.3 million, compared with $118.1 million in the same prior-year period. Net cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2016 was impacted by $96.6 million in net repayments under our revolving credit facility compared to $45.3 million in the prior year, and $6.8 million in share repurchases, compared to $55.7 million in the prior year.  
 On July 14, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.14 which was paid on October 14, 2016 to shareholders of record as of September 15, 2016. On September 28, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved payment of a $0.14 per share dividend to shareholders of record as of December 15, 2016 to be paid on January 13, 2017. 
 The 2013 Credit Agreement and the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement (each as defined in Note 11  Debt  in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Form 10-K) limit the Company s ability to repurchase its stock when the Company s Leverage Ratio, as defined in the 2013 Credit Agreement and the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement and as reported to its lenders, exceeds 3.00 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s Leverage Ratio was 2.77 to 1.00.

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 Essendant s growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing. We believe that our cash from operations and collections of receivables, coupled with our sources of borrowings and available cash on hand, are sufficient to fund currently anticipated requirements. These requirements include payments of interest and dividends, scheduled debt repayments, capital expenditures, working capital needs, restructuring activities, the funding of pension plans, and funding for additional share repurchases and acquisitions, if any. Due to our credit profile over the years, external funds have been available at an acceptable cost. We believe that current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of our balance sheet affords us the financial flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions.  
 Financing available from debt and the sale of accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016, is summarized below (in millions):  
 Availability

 The Receivables Securitization Program provides for maximum funding available of the lesser of $200.0 million or the total amount of eligible receivables less excess concentrations and applicable reserves.

 Contractual Obligations 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, contractual obligations increased by $73.8 million from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by new facility leases, facility lease renewals and new multi-year technology contracts.

          QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.      

 The Company is subject to market risk associated principally with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.     

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act is made known to management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

   RISK FACTORS.     

 For information regarding risk factors, see  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of Part I of the 2015 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in such Form 10-K, except for the following two revised risk factors. 
 Price transparency, customer consolidation, and changes in product sales mix may result in lower margins. 
 The Company faces price and margin pressure due to a number of factors, including: 

Increased price transparency, driven by online resellers     

Customer consolidation resulting in some customers increasing their buying power and seeking economic      

 concessions from the Company 

Shift in customer mix from higher to lower margin channels and vertical markets     

Secular decline in office products categories leading to unfavorable product mix     

Vendor consolidation.     

If Essendant is unable to reduce expenses, grow sales to existing and new customers, and increase sales of higher margin products as a percentage of total sales, the Company s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.  
 For example, during the second and third quarters of 2016, despite the Company s success at converting customers, profitability was adversely affected by margin pressure resulting from a shift in customer mix to lower margin customers and in product category mix to lower margin products. The transparency of pricing online also caused margin pressure. 
 Essendant s reliance on supplier allowances and promotional incentives could impact profitability. 
 Supplier allowances and promotional incentives that are often based on the volume of Company product purchases contribute significantly to Essendant s profitability. If Essendant does not comply with suppliers  terms and conditions, or does not make requisite purchases to achieve certain volume hurdles, Essendant may not earn certain allowances and promotional incentives. Additionally, suppliers may reduce the allowances they pay Essendant if they conclude the value Essendant creates does not justify the allowances. If Essendant s suppliers reduce or otherwise alter their allowances or promotional incentives, Essendant s profit margin for the sale of the products it purchases from those suppliers may decline. The loss or diminution of supplier allowances and promotional support could have an adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. 
 For example, in the second quarter of 2016, lower supplier allowances and promotional incentives contributed to the unfavorable margin impact of the product category mix shift, and as the Company executed its strategy to improve cash flow in part through lower inventory balances in the third quarter of 2016, a reduction in purchases from suppliers resulted in lower supplier allowances, which  contributed to  the unfavorable gross margin changes.

3.

The Participant s right to receive payment under this Cash Incentive Award will vest on December 31, 2018 (the  Scheduled Vesting Date ), provided that the Participant s Date of Termination has not occurred before the Scheduled Vesting Date, and provided further that the Company s cumulative Earnings Per Share (as defined in Section 6) for the four (4) calendar quarters ending June 30, 2017 exceeds fifty cents ($0.50) per share.   If the Participant s Date of Termination occurs for any reason before the Scheduled Vesting Date all of the rights to receive payment under this Agreement will be forfeited, subject to the following exceptions:     

(a)   
 
  If (i) the Company meets the Earnings Per Share goal of fifty cents ($0.50) per share stated above, and (ii) prior to the Participant s Date of Termination substantially all of the assets or equity of the ORS Nasco business is sold to an unrelated third party (as determined by the Committee), Participant will receive a payment equal to the percentage specified in Section 4 below (the  Applicable Vesting Percentage ) times Target.

For the avoidance of doubt, only the occurrence of the first Vesting Event will be considered a Vesting Event for purposes of this Agreement.    

  Otherwise, except with respect to a Vesting Event described in Section 3(b)(ii) (for which no such certification shall be required), if  the Committee has certified in writing the Company s cumulative Earnings Per Share (as defined in Section 6) for the four (4) calendar quarters ending June 30, 2017 exceeds fifty cents ($0.50) per share (which certification shall occur no later than December 15, 2017), and  if a Vesting Event has occurred prior to the Scheduled Vesting Date, the Participant s Applicable Vesting Percentage shall be determined according to the date the Vesting Event occurs as follows: 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4, (a) if either (I) a Vesting Event occurs prior to January 1, 2017, or (II) except with respect to a Vesting Event described in Section 3(b)(ii), the Committee does not certify in writing that the cumulative Earnings Per Share (as defined in Section 6) for the four (4) calendar quarters ending June 30, 2017 has exceeded fifty cents ($0.50) per share  (which certification shall occur no later than December 15, 2017),  then in either case the Applicable Vesting Percentage shall be zero percent (0%), and (b) if the Participant becomes entitled to payment hereunder pursuant to Section 3(b), the Applicable Vesting Percentage shall be determined pursuant to this Section 4 irrespective of whether the Committee s certification has occurred. 

5.   
 
  Amount and Time of Payment .

Otherwise, the amount of the Participant s payment will equal the Applicable Vesting Percentage times Target.    

     If the Participant s Date of Termination does not occur prior to the Scheduled Vesting Date, payment shall be made in the first calendar quarter following the Scheduled Vesting Date. If the   
 2 

Participant s Date of Termination d  oes occur prior to the Scheduled Vesting Date, payment shall be made on the first business day following a period of six (6) months after the Date of Termination, or if later, the first business day following the Committee s certification in writing that t  he cumulative Earnings Per Share (as defined in Section 6) for the four (4) calendar quarters ending June 30, 2017 has exceeded fifty cents ($0.50) per share   (which certification shall occur no later than December 15, 2017);   provided   that any payment that   becomes due pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof shall not be subject to delay pending such certification  .  

6.

7.   
 
  Payment in the Event of   the   Participant s Death  .

8.   
 
    Restrictive Covenants; Recovery of Payments  . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, the Company may recover the Award granted or paid under this Agreement to the extent required by the terms of any clawback or compensation recovery policy adopted by the Company. Furthermore, and in consideration of the grant of the Award under the terms of this Agreement and in recognition of the fact that Participant has received and will receive Confidential Information (as defined in paragraph 8(e)(iv)) during Participant s Service (as defined in paragraph 8(e)(v)), Participant agrees to be bound by the restrictive covenants set forth in paragraphs 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and 8(d), below (the  Restrictive Covenants ). In addition, but subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, Participant agrees that if Participant violates any provision of such Restrictive Covenants, then any payment received under this Agreement at any time during the three (3) year period immediately preceding the date on which such violation occurred shall immediately be repaid back to the Company (the  Forfeited Payment ). Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, Participant hereby agrees that upon demand from the Company at any time after discovery of the violation of a Restrictive Covenant or imposition of a claw back, Participant shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the payment (before tax withholdings) made by Company to Participant under this Agreement. Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph and any applicable limitations of Code Section 409A, by accepting this Agreement, Participant consents to a deduction from any amounts the Company owes Participant from time to time (including amounts owed to Participant as wages or other compensation, fringe benefits, or vacation pay, as well as any other amounts owed to Participant by the Company), to the extent of the amounts Participant owes the Company under this Section 8. Whether or not the Company elects to make any set-off in whole or in part, if the Company does not recover by means of set-off the full amount Participant owes

pursuant to this Section 8, Participant hereby agrees to pay immediately the unpaid balance to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and to the extent that a violation of a Restrictive Covenant is cu  rable at the time of discovery by the Company, Participant will not be deemed to have violated such Restrictive Covenant unless and until the Company gives Participant written notice of such violation and Participant fails to cure such violation within thi  rty (30) calendar days after receipt of such written notice.

(b)   
 
  Competitive Activities . During Participant s Service and for two (2) years after the termination of Participant s Service for any reason whatsoever (including Retirement), Participant shall not engage in any Competitive Activity (as defined in paragraph 8(e)(iii)). Participant s obligations under this paragraph 8(b) shall apply in any geographic territory in which the Company conducts its business during the term of the Participant s Service. In the event that any portion of this paragraph 8(b) shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it is unreasonably restrictive in any respect, it shall be interpreted to extend over the maximum period of time for which it reasonably may be enforced and to the maximum extent for which it reasonably may be enforced in all other respects, and enforced as so interpreted, all as determined by such court in such action. Participant acknowledges the uncertainty of the law in this respect and expressly stipulates that this Agreement is to be given the construction that renders its provisions valid and enforceable to the maximum extent (not exceeding its express terms) possible under applicable law.

 4 

business relationship between any such current or potential customer, vendor, supplier, licensee, licensor, or other business relation and the Company;      

(v)

 3 

or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Incumbent Board (a    Proxy Contest   ), or (ii) by reason of an agreement intended to avoid or settle any actual or threatened Elec  tion Contest or Proxy Contest;

 (ii) the individuals who were members of the Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution of the initial agreement providing for such Business Combination constitute more than 50% of the members of the board of directors (or comparable governing body of a noncorporate entity) of the Surviving Company; and  
 (iii) no Person (other than Holding, any of its Subsidiaries or any employee benefit plan (or any trust forming a part thereof) maintained by Holding, the Surviving Company or any Person who immediately prior to such Business Combination had Beneficial Ownership of 30% or more of the then Voting Securities) has Beneficial Ownership of 30% or more of the then combined voting power of the Surviving Company s then outstanding voting securities; provided, that notwithstanding this clause (iii), a Change of Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because any Person acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than 30% of Voting Securities as a result of the issuance of Voting Securities by Holding in exchange for assets (including equity interests) or funds with a fair value equal to the fair value of the Voting Securities so issued; provided, however that a Business Combination with a Person in which the Executive has a substantial equity interest shall not constitute a Change of Control with respect to such Person.  
   (d) The closing of any assignment, sale, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Holding to any Person (other than a Person in which the Executive has a substantial equity interest (in which case there shall not be a Change of Control with respect to such Person) and other than a Subsidiary of Holding or other entity, the Persons with Beneficial Ownership of which are the same Persons with Beneficial Ownership of Holding and such  
 4 

Beneficial Ownership is in substantially the same proportions), or the occurrence of the same.  
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of  Section 409A of the Code, the events that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control hereunder shall not constitute a Change of Control unless and until such events also constitute a  change in control event  (as described in Treas.

   Code   shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

For purposes of this Agreement, a Change of Control, alone, does not constitute Good Reason.  Furthermore, notwithstanding the above, the occurrence of any of the events described above will not constitute Good Reason unless (x) the Executive gives the Companies written notice within thirty (30) days after the initial occurrence of any of such events that the Executive believes that such event constitutes Good Reason, and (y) the Companies thereafter fail to cure any such event within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice. 
     Person   shall mean any natural person, firm, corporation, limited liability company, trust, partnership, limited or limited liability partnership, business association, joint venture or other entity and, for purposes of the definition of Change of Control herein, shall comprise any  person , within the meaning of Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, including a  group  as therein defined.

      (vi) the Executive shall receive a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the amount the Companies would otherwise expe nd for 24 months of coverage for its share of the premiums for life and disability insurance plans or programs as

   (viii) if the Executive s outstanding equity-based incentive awards have not by then fully vested pursuant to the terms of the Companies  applicable e quity-based incentive plan(s) and applicable award agreement(s), then to the extent permitted in those plan(s) and as provided in the applicable award agreement(s), the Executive shall continue to vest in the Executive s unvested equity-based incentive awards following the Termination Date;

Any cash payment due under Section 5(c)(iii), (iv) and (vi)  or under Section 5(d)(ii), (iii), (iv), (vi), and (vii) is intended to constitute a short-term deferral under Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(4) and, accordingly, notwithstanding any longer time period specified in Section 5(c) or (d), such payment shall be made no later than two and one-half (2-1/2) months after the end of the calendar year in which the right to the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of the regulations under Section 409A of the Code, with payment in all cases being conditioned on satisfaction of the requirements of Section 5(h).   
      (f)    If the Employment Period is terminated as a result of the Executive s death, Disability or Retirement (as defined below), then the Executive shall be entitled to (i) the Executive s Accrued Benefits in accordance with Section 5(a), (ii) any benefits that may be payable to the Executive under any applicable Board-approved disab  ility, life insurance or retirement plan or policy in accordance with the terms of such plan or policy, and (iii) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to: 
         (A)    in the event the Employment Period is terminated as a result of Executive s death or Disability, an amount equal to the pro-rata target Annual Bonus award for the calendar year during which the Termination Date occurs by reason of the Executive s death or   Disability  . Such lump sum payment shall be determined by multiplying the target Annual Bonus award amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year of the Termination Date elapsed prior to the Termination Date and the denominator of which is three hundred and sixty-five (365);  or   
       (B) in the event the Employment Period is terminated as a result of Executive s Retirement, an amount equal to the pro-rata actual Annual Bonus award for the calendar year during which the T   ermination Date occurs by reason of the Executive s Retirement. Such lump sum payment shall be determined by multiplying the actual Annual Bonus award amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year of the Termination Date elapsed  
 12 

prior to the Termination Date and the denominator of which is three hundred and sixty-five (365).  
         In the event the Employment Period is terminated as a result of Executive s death, such lump sum payment shall be made within 30 days following the Termination Date; in the event the Employment Period is terminated as a result of Executive s Disability or Retirement, such lump sum payment shall be made on  the date that Annual Bonus payments are made to other participants in the Bonus Plan, but in no case later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Termination Date occurs      .   As used in this Agreement,   Retirement   shall mean the Executive s separation from service (as defined in the regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Code) occurring after the Executive reaches age sixty (60) and having completed at least five (5) years of service with the Companies. 
  (g) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, if the Executive terminates his employment for any reason other  than Disability or Retirement and without Good Reason, or the Companies terminate the Executive s employment for Cause, all of the Executive s rights to payment from the Companies (including pursuant to any plan or policy of the Companies) shall terminate immediately, except the right to payment for Accrued Benefits in respect of periods prior to such termination.  
   (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5, the Executive shall be required to execute the Companies  then current  standard release agreement as a condition to receiving any of the payments and benefits provided for in Sections 5(c) and (d), excluding the Accrued Benefits in accordance with Section 5(a), and no payments and benefits provided for in Sections 5(c) and (d) other than the Accrued Benefits in accordance with Section 5(a) shall be payable to Executive unless all applicable consideration and rescission periods for the release agreement have expired, Executive has not rescinded the release agreement and Executive is in compliance with each of the terms and conditions of such release agreement and this Agreement as of the date of such payments and benefits.  It is acknowledged and agreed that the then current standard release agreement shall not diminish or terminate the Executive s rights under this Agreement or the Indemnification Agreement (identified in Section 16 below). 
   (i) In the event of a termination of the Executive s employment entitling the Executive to benefits under Section 5(c) or 5(d) above, subje ct to the Executive s affirmative obligations pursuant to Section 6, the Executive shall be under no obligation to seek other employment or otherwise mitigate the obligations of the Companies under this Agreement. 
                       (j)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the cash payments due and the other benefits to which Executive shall become entitled under Section 5, either alone or together with other payments in the nature of compensation to Executive which are contingent on a change in the ownership or effective control of the Companies or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Companies or otherwise, would constitute a  parachute payment  (as defined in Section 280G of the Code or any successor provision thereto), such payments or benefits shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the largest aggregate amount as will result in no portion thereof being  
 13 

subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or   being non-deductible to the Companies for Federal Income Tax purposes pursuant to Section 280G of the Code (or any successor provision thereto),   provided, however, that the foregoing reduction will be made only if and to the extent that such reduction wou  ld result in an increase in the aggregate payment and benefits to be provided to Executive, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax impos  ed by any comparable provision of state law, and any applicable federal, state and local income taxes). Executive agrees to take such action as Employer reasonably requests to mitigate or challenge the application of such tax, provided that Employer shall   supply such counsel and expert advice, including legal counsel and accounting advice, as may reasonably be required, and shall be responsible for the payment of such experts  fees.      If requested by Executive or the Companies, the determination of whether a  ny reduction in payments or benefits to be provided under this Section 5 or otherwise is required pursuant to this Section 5(j) will be made by a national accounting firm selected and reimbursed by the Companies from among the ten (10) largest accounting f  irms in the United States as determined by gross revenues, not then-engaged as the Companies  independent public auditor (the    Accounting Firm   ), subject to Executive s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and the determination of such Accounting Firm   will be final and binding on all parties. In making its determination, the Accounting Firm will allocate a reasonable portion of such payments and benefits to the value of any personal services rendered following the Change of Control and the value of any   non-competition agreement or similar agreements to the extent that such items reduce the amount of the parachute payment.     In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided under this Section 5 or otherwise is required to be reduced pursuant   to this Section 5(j), the Companies     shall make such reduction first by reducing amounts payable under Section 5(d)(i) and thereafter by reducing amounts payable under the following Sections of this Agreement in the following order, as necessary to achieve     the reduction: 5(d)(iii), 5(d)(iv), 5(d)(vi), 5(d)(vii), and 5(d)(ii).  Amounts payable as reimbursements under Sections 5(d)(v) and 5(d)(x), if any, shall not be subject to reduction.    No modification of, or successor provision to, Section 280G or Sectio  n 4999 subsequent to the date of this Agreement shall, however, reduce the benefits to which the Executive would be entitled under this Agreement in the absence of this Section 5(j) to a greater extent than they would have been reduced if Section 280G and     Section 4999 had not been modified or superseded subsequent to the date of this Agreement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the first sentence of this Section 5(j).

ATTACHMENT A  
 INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT 
 This INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of the ____ day of __________, 20__ (the "Agreement"), by and between Essendant Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), the director or executive officer of the Company whose name appears on the signature page of this Agreement ("Indemnitee"), and for purposes of Section 9 only, Essendant Co., an Illinois corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( ECO ). 
 WHEREAS, highly competent persons are becoming more reluctant to serve publicly-held corporations as directors or executive officers or in other capacities unless they are provided with reasonable protection through insurance or indemnification against risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporations. 
 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that the Company should act to assure its directors and executive officers that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future. 
 WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified. 
 WHEREAS, Indemnitee is willing to serve, to continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that Indemnitee be so indemnified. 
 WHEREAS, in consideration of the benefits received and to be received by the Company in connection with actions taken and to be taken by the Board and by the officers of the Company, the Company has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company for the reasons set forth above to be a party to this Agreement and to provide indemnification to the directors and executive officers of the Company in connection with their service to and activities on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 WHEREAS, the Company acknowledges that for purposes of this Agreement the directors and executive officers of the Company who enter into this Agreement are serving in such capacities at the request of the Company. 
 WHEREAS, the Company further acknowledges that such directors and executive officers are willing to serve, to continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company, thereby benefiting the Company and its subsidiaries, on the condition that the Company enter into, and provide indemnification pursuant to, this Agreement. 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows: 
 1.   Definitions . 
  (a)For purposes of this Agreement:  
              (i)"A ffiliate" shall mean any corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise in respect of which Indemnitee is or was or will be serving directly or indirectly at the request of the Company. 

94491503\V-5   

(ii)  "Disinterested Director" shall   mean a director of the Company who is not or was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is being sought by Indemnitee.  
            (iii)"Expenses" shall include all reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, retainers, court costs,  transcripts, fees of experts, witness fees, travel expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges, postage, delivery service fees and all other disbursements or expenses incurred in connection with asserting or defending claims. 
             (iv)"Independent Counsel" shall mean a law firm or lawyer that neither is presently nor in the past calendar year has been retained to represent: (i) the Company or Indemnitee in any matter material to any such party or (ii) any other party  to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder in any matter material to such other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" shall not include any law firm or person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing any of the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee's right to indemnification under this Agreement. All Expenses of the Independent Counsel incurred in connection with acting pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne by the Company. 
             (v)"Losses" shall mean all liabilities, losses and claims (including judgments, fines, penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) incurred in connecti on with any Proceeding. 
            (vi)"Proceeding" shall include any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, mediation, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, administrative hearing or any other proceeding, whether c ivil, criminal, administrative or investigative. 
 2.   Service by Indemnitee . Indemnitee agrees to begin or continue to serve the Company or any Affiliate as a director or an executive officer. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, this Agreement shall not create a contract of employment between the Company and Indemnitee, and the termination of Indemnitee's relationship with the Company or an Affiliate by either party hereto shall not be restricted by this Agreement. 
 3.   Indemnification . The Company agrees to indemnify Indemnitee for, and hold Indemnitee harmless from and against, any Losses or Expenses at any time incurred by or assessed against Indemnitee arising out of or in connection with the service of Indemnitee as a director or an executive officer of the Company or in any capacity for an Affiliate at the request of the Company (collectively referred to as a "Director or an Officer of the Company") to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware in effect on the date hereof or as such laws may from time to time hereafter be amended to increase the scope of such permitted indemnification. Without diminishing the scope of the indemnification provided by this Section 3, the rights of indemnification of Indemnitee provided hereunder shall include but shall not be limited to those rights set forth hereinafter. 
   4.   Action or Proceeding Other Than an Action by or in the Right of the Company . Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided herein if Indemnitee is a person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any Proceeding, other than an action by or in the  

94491503\V-5   

right of the Company, as the case may be, by reason of (a) the fact th  at Indemnitee is or was a Director or an Officer of the Company or (b) anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity.  
 5.   Actions by or in the Right of the Company . Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided herein if Indemnitee is a person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of (a) the fact that Indemnitee is or was a Director or an Officer of the Company or (b) anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity. Pursuant to this Section, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against Losses or Expenses incurred or suffered by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection with the defense or settlement of any Proceeding if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Delaware law expressly prohibits such indemnification by reason of an adjudication of liability of Indemnitee to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such Losses and Expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. 
 6.   Indemnification for Losses and Expenses of Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been wholly successful on the merits or otherwise in any Proceeding referred to in Section 3, 4 or 5 hereof on any claim, issue or matter therein, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Losses and Expenses incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company agrees to indemnify Indemnitee to the maximum extent permitted by law against all Losses and Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter. In any review or Proceeding to determine the extent of indemnification, the Company shall bear the burden of proving any lack of success and which amounts sought in indemnity are allocable to claims, issues or matters which were not successfully resolved. For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any such claim, issue or matter by dismissal with or without prejudice shall be deemed to be a successful resolution as to such claim, issue or matter. 
 7.   Payment for Expenses of a Witness . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a Director or an Officer of the Company, a witness in any Proceeding, the Company agrees to pay to Indemnitee all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection therewith. 
   8.   Advancement of Expenses . All Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee (or reasonably expected by Indemnitee to be incurred by Indemnitee within three months) in connection with any Proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding within twenty days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting from time to time such advance or advances, whether or  

94491503\V-5   

not a determination to indemnify has been made under Section 10. Indemnitee's entitlement to such advancement of Expenses shall include those incurred in connection with any Proceeding by Indemnitee seeking an   adjudication or award in arbitration pursuant to this Agreement. The financial ability of Indemnitee to repay an advance shall not be a prerequisite to the making of such advance. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence such Expenses incurre  d (or reasonably expected to be incurred) by Indemnitee in connection therewith and shall include or be accompanied by a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not enti  tled to be indemnified therefor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  
 9.   Guarantee .  In the event that the Company fails or is unable to perform any of its payment obligations under the terms of this Agreement, ECO hereby unconditionally guarantees that it will perform the obligations of the Company and pay Indemnitee for any Losses or Expenses for which Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified or for Expenses to be advanced hereunder.  Such payment will be made promptly upon request and without the necessity of a demand. 
 10.   Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification . 
  (a)When seeking indemnification under this Agreement (which shall not include in any case the right of Indemnitee to receive payments pursuant to Section 7 and Secti on 8 hereof, which shall not be subject to this Section 10), Indemnitee shall submit a written request for indemnification to the Company. Determination of Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made promptly, but in no event later than 30 days after receipt by the Company of Indemnitee's written request for indemnification. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of Indemnitee's request for indemnification, advise the Board that Indemnitee has made such request for indemnification. 
  (b)The entitlement of Indemnitee to indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined in the specific case (1) by the Board by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (2) if there are no Disinter ested Directors, or if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel or (3) by the stockholders. 
  (c)In the event the determination of entitlement is to be made by Independent Counsel, such Independent Counsel shall be selected by the In demnitee, subject to the approval of the Board, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.  Upon failure of the Indemnitee to so select such Independent Counsel or upon failure of the Board to so approve, such Independent Counsel shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association of New York, New York or such other person as such Association shall designate to make such selection. 
  (d)If the determination made pursuant to Section 10(b) is that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification to th e full extent of Indemnitee's request, Indemnitee shall have the right to seek entitlement to indemnification in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 11 hereof. 
    (e)If the person or persons empowered pursuant to Section 10(b) to make a det ermination with respect to entitlement to indemnification shall have failed to make the requested determination within 30 days after receipt by the Company of such request, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be absolutely entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) misrepresentation by  

94491503\V-5   

Indemnitee of a material fact in the request for indemnification or (ii) a final judicial determination that all or any part of such indemnifi  cation is expressly prohibited by law.  
  (f)The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the rights of Indemnitee to  indemnification hereunder except as may be specifically provided herein, or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, as the case may be, or create a presumption that (with respect to any criminal action or proceeding) Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful. 
  (g)For purposes of any determination of good faith hereunder, Indemnite e shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if in taking such action Indemnitee relied on the records or books of account of the Company or an Affiliate, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Company or an Affiliate in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company or an Affiliate or on information or records given or reports made to the Company or an Affiliate by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care to the Company or an Affiliate. The Company shall have the burden of establishing the absence of good faith. The provisions of this Section 10(g) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement. 
  (h)The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director, officer, agent or employee of the Company  or an Affiliate shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement. 
 11.   Remedies in Cases of Determination Not to Indemnify or to Advance Expenses . 
  (a)In the event that (i) a determination  is made that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder, (ii) advances are not made pursuant to Section 8 hereof or (iii) payment has not been timely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification pursuant to Section 10 hereof, Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek a final adjudication either through an arbitration proceeding or in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction of Indemnitee's entitlement to such indemnification or advance. 
  (b)In the event a determination has been made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 10 hereof, in whole or in part, that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration referred to in Section  11(a) shall be de novo and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of any such prior determination that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, and the Company shall bear the burdens of proof specified in Sections 6 and 10 hereof in such proceeding. 
  (c)If a determination is made or deemed to have been made pursuant to the terms of Section 10 hereof or this Section 11 that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or  arbitration in the absence of (i) a misrepresentation of a material fact by Indemnitee or (ii) a final judicial determination that all or any part of such indemnification is expressly prohibited by law. 

94491503\V-5   

(d)  To the extent deemed appropriate by the court,   interest shall be paid by the Company to Indemnitee at a rate equal to the rate paid by the Company or its subsidiaries to the principal senior secured lender thereto for amounts which the Company indemnifies or is obliged to indemnify Indemnitee for the   period commencing with the date on which Indemnitee requested indemnification (or reimbursement or advancement of any Expenses) and ending with the date on which such payment is made to Indemnitee by the Company.  
 12.   Expenses Incurred by Indemnitee to Enforce this Agreement . All Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the preparation and submission of Indemnitee's request for indemnification hereunder shall be borne by the Company. In the event that Indemnitee is a party to or intervenes in any proceeding in which the validity or enforceability of this Agreement is at issue or seeks an adjudication to enforce Indemnitee's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, Indemnitee, if Indemnitee prevails in whole in such action, shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee. If it is determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for part (but not all) of the indemnification so requested, Expenses incurred in seeking enforcement of such partial indemnification shall be reasonably prorated among the claims, issues or matters for which Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification and for claims, issues or matters for which Indemnitee is not so entitled. 
 13.   Non-Exclusivity .  The rights of indemnification and to receive advances as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under any law, certificate of incorporation, by-law, other agreement, vote of stockholders or resolution of directors or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitee's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such directorship or office. To the extent Indemnitee would be prejudiced thereby, no amendment, alteration, rescission or replacement of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be effective as to Indemnitee with respect to any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in Indemnitee's position with the Company or an Affiliate or any other entity which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company prior to such amendment, alteration, rescission or replacement. 
 14.   Duration of Agreement . This Agreement shall apply to any claim asserted and any Losses and Expenses incurred in connection with any claim asserted on or after the effective date of this Agreement and shall continue until and terminate upon the later of: (a) ten years after Indemnitee has ceased to occupy any of the positions or have any of the relationships described in Section 3, 4 or 5 hereof; or (b) one year after the final termination of all pending or threatened Proceedings of the kind described herein with respect to Indemnitee. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and Indemnitee's spouse, assigns, heirs, devisee, executors, administrators or other legal representatives. 
 15.   Maintenance of D O Insurance . 
    (a)The Company hereby covenants and ag rees with Indemnitee that, so long as Indemnitee shall continue to serve as a Director or an Officer of the Company and thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible claim or threatened, pending or completed Proceeding, whether civil, criminal or investigative, by reason of the fact that Indemnitee was a Director or an Officer of the Company or any other entity which Indemnitee was serving at the request of the Company, the Company shall maintain in full force and effect (i) the directors' and  

94491503\V-5   

officers' liability insurance issued by the insurer and having the policy amount and deductible as currently in effect with respect to directors and officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (ii) any replacement or substitute policies i  ssued by one or more reputable insurers providing in all respects coverage at least comparable to and in the same amount as that currently provided under such existing policy (collectively, "D O Insurance").  
  (b)In all policies of D O Insurance, Indemnit ee shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits, subject to the same limitations, as are accorded to the Company's directors or officers most favorably insured by such policy. 
  (c)Notwithstanding any thing to the contrary set forth in (a) above, the Company shall have no obligation to maintain D O Insurance if the Company determines in good faith that such insurance is not reasonably available, the premium cost for such insurance is disproportionate to the amount of coverage provided or the coverage provided by such insurance is limited by exclusions so as to provide an insufficient benefit. 
  (d)If the Company ceases to maintain D O Insurance, the Company shall notify Indemnitee in writing of such ces sation within three (3) calendar days of the earlier of (i) the date the Company determines to cease D O Insurance or (ii) the date D O Insurance ceases. 
 16.   Severability . Should any part, term or condition hereof be declared illegal or unenforceable or in conflict with any other law, the validity of the remaining portions or provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and the illegal or unenforceable portions hereof shall be and hereby are redrafted to conform with applicable law, while leaving the remaining portions hereof intact.

 19.   Modification and Waiver . No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by each of the parties hereto. 
 20.   No Duplicative Payment . The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment (net of Expenses incurred in collecting such payment) under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.

   (d) The closing of any assignment, sale, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Holding to any Person (other than a Person in which the Executive has a substantial equity interest (in which case there shall not be a Change of Control with respect to such Person) and other than a Subsidiary of Holding or other entity, the Persons with Beneficial Ownership of which are the same Persons with Beneficial Ownership of Holding and such

Any cash payment due under Section 5(c)(iii), (iv) and (vi)  or under Section 5(d)(ii), (iii), (iv), (vi), and (vii) is intended to constitute a short-term deferral under Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(4) and, accordingly, notwithstanding any longer time period specified in Section 5(c) or (d), such payment shall be made no later than two and one-half (2-1/2) months after the end of the calendar year in which the right to the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of the regulations under Section 409A of the Code, with payment in all cases being conditioned on satisfaction of the requirements of Section 5(h).   
       (f)    If the Employment Period is terminated as a result of the Executive s death, Disability or Retirement (as defined below), then the Executive shall be entitled to (i) the Executive s Accrued Benefits in accordance with Section 5(a), (ii) any benefits that may be payable to the Executive under any applicable Board-approved disability, life insurance or retirement plan o  r policy in accordance with the terms of such plan or policy, and (iii) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to: 
         (A)   in the event the Employment Period is terminated as a result of Executive s death or Disability, an amount equal to the pro-rata  target A  nnual Bonus award for the calendar year during which the Termination Date occurs by reason of the Executive s death or Disability  . Such lump sum payment shall be determined by multiplying the target Annual Bonus award amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year of the Termination Date elapsed prior to the Termination Date and the denominator of which is three hundred and sixty-five (365);  or   
     (B) in the event the Employment Period is terminated as a result of Exe   cutive s Retirement, an amount equal to the pro-rata actual Annual Bonus award for the calendar year during which the Termination Date occurs by reason of the Executive s Retirement. Such lump sum payment shall be determined by multiplying the actual Annual Bonus award amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year of the Termination Date elapsed prior to the Termination Date and the denominator of which is three hundred and sixty-five (365). 
 12 

In the event the Employm  ent Period is terminated as a result of Executive s death, such lump sum payment shall be made within 30 days following the Termination Date; in the event the Employment Period is terminated as a result of Executive s Disability   or Retirement  , such lump su  m payment shall be made   on     th  e date that   Annual Bonus payments are made to other participants in the   Bonus Plan, but in no case later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Termination Date occurs      .    As used in this Agreement,    Retirement    shall mean the Executive s separation from service (as defined in the regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Code) occurring after the Executive reaches age sixty (60) and having completed at least five (5) years of service with the Companies.  
 (g) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, if the Executive terminates his employment for any reason other than Disability or Retirement and without Good Reason, or the Companies terminate the Executive s employment for Cause, all of the Executiv e s rights to payment from the Companies (including pursuant to any plan or policy of the Companies) shall terminate immediately, except the right to payment for Accrued Benefits in respect of periods prior to such termination.  
   (h) Notwithstanding anythin g to the contrary contained in this Section 5, the Executive shall be required to execute the Companies  then current standard release agreement as a condition to receiving any of the payments and benefits provided for in Sections 5(c) and (d), excluding the Accrued Benefits in accordance with Section 5(a), and no payments and benefits provided for in Sections 5(c) and (d) other than the Accrued Benefits in accordance with Section 5(a) shall be payable to Executive unless all applicable consideration and rescission periods for the release agreement have expired, Executive has not rescinded the release agreement and Executive is in compliance with each of the terms and conditions of such release agreement and this Agreement as of the date of such payments and benefits.  It is acknowledged and agreed that the then current standard release agreement shall not diminish or terminate the Executive s rights under this Agreement or the Indemnification Agreement (identified in Section 16 below). 
   (i) In the event of a  termination of the Executive s employment entitling the Executive to benefits under Section 5(c) or 5(d) above, subject to the Executive s affirmative obligations pursuant to Section 6, the Executive shall be under no obligation to seek other employment or otherwise mitigate the obligations of the Companies under this Agreement. 
                       (j)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the cash payments due and the other benefits to which Executive shall become entitled under Section 5, either alone or together with other payments in the nature of compensation to Executive which are contingent on a change in the ownership or effective control of the Companies or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Companies or otherwise, would constitute a  parachute payment  (as defined in Section 280G of the Code or any successor provision thereto), such payments or benefits shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the largest aggregate amount as will result in no portion thereof being subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or being non-deductible to the Companies for Federal Income Tax  
 13 

purposes pursuant to Section 280G of the Code (or any successor provision the  reto),   provided, however, that the foregoing reduction will be made only if and to the extent that such reduction would result in an increase in the aggregate payment and benefits to be provided to Executive, determined on an after-tax basis (taking into a  ccount the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law, and any applicable federal, state and local income taxes). Executive agrees to take such actio  n as Employer reasonably requests to mitigate or challenge the application of such tax, provided that Employer shall supply such counsel and expert advice, including legal counsel and accounting advice, as may reasonably be required, and shall be responsib  le for the payment of such experts  fees.      If requested by Executive or the Companies, the determination of whether any reduction in payments or benefits to be provided under this Section 5 or otherwise is required pursuant to this Section 5(j) will be mad  e by a national accounting firm selected and reimbursed by the Companies from among the ten (10) largest accounting firms in the United States as determined by gross revenues, not then-engaged as the Companies  independent public auditor (the    Accounting F  irm   ), subject to Executive s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and the determination of such Accounting Firm will be final and binding on all parties. In making its determination, the Accounting Firm will allocate a reasonable portion of such paym  ents and benefits to the value of any personal services rendered following the Change of Control and the value of any non-competition agreement or similar agreements to the extent that such items reduce the amount of the parachute payment.     In the event tha  t any payment or benefit intended to be provided under this Section 5 or otherwise is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 5(j), the Companies     shall make such reduction first by reducing amounts payable under Section 5(d)(i) and thereafter by re  ducing amounts payable under the following Sections of this Agreement in the following order, as necessary to achieve the reduction: 5(d)(iii), 5(d)(iv), 5(d)(vi), 5(d)(vii), and 5(d)(ii).  Amounts payable as reimbursements under Sections 5(d)(v) and 5(d)(    x), if any, shall not be subject to reduction.    No modification of, or successor provision to, Section 280G or Section 4999 subsequent to the date of this Agreement shall, however, reduce the benefits to which the Executive would be entitled under this Agr  eement in the absence of this Section 5(j) to a greater extent than they would have been reduced if Section 280G and Section 4999 had not been modified or superseded subsequent to the date of this Agreement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provide    d in the first sentence of this Section 5(j).

The Companies may assign their rights under this Agreement to any successor to all or substantially all the assets of the Companies, by merger or otherwise, and may assign or encumber this Agreement and its rights hereunder as security for indebtedness of the Companies.  Any such assignment by the Companies shall remain subject to the Executive s rights under Section 5 hereof.  The rights of the Executive under this Agreement may not be assigned or encumbered by the Executive, voluntarily or involuntarily, during the Executive s lifetime, and any such purported assignment shall be void   ab initio  .

Reg. Section 1.409A-1(h)) during a period in which Executive is a  specified employee  (as defined in Code Section 409A(2)(B)(i)), then: (i) the amount of such non-exempt deferred compensation that would otherwise be payable during the six-month period immediately following Executive s separation from service will be accumulated through and paid (without interest) or

 INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT 
   
 This INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of the ____ day of __________, 20__ (the "Agreement"), by and between Essendant Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), the director or executive officer of the Company whose name appears on the signature page of this Agreement ("Indemnitee"), and for purposes of Section 9 only, Essendant Co., an Illinois corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( ECO ). 
 WHEREAS, highly competent persons are becoming more reluctant to serve publicly-held corporations as directors or executive officers or in other capacities unless they are provided with reasonable protection through insurance or indemnification against risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporations. 
 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that the Company should act to assure its directors and executive officers that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future. 
 WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified. 
 WHEREAS, Indemnitee is willing to serve, to continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that Indemnitee be so indemnified. 
 WHEREAS, in consideration of the benefits received and to be received by the Company in connection with actions taken and to be taken by the Board and by the officers of the Company, the Company has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company for the reasons set forth above to be a party to this Agreement and to provide indemnification to the directors and executive officers of the Company in connection with their service to and activities on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 WHEREAS, the Company acknowledges that for purposes of this Agreement the directors and executive officers of the Company who enter into this Agreement are serving in such capacities at the request of the Company. 
 WHEREAS, the Company further acknowledges that such directors and executive officers are willing to serve, to continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company, thereby benefiting the Company and its subsidiaries, on the condition that the Company enter into, and provide indemnification pursuant to, this Agreement. 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows:

             (ii)"Disinterested Director" shall mean  a director of the Company who is not or was not a party to the Proceeding in respect of which indemnification is being sought by Indemnitee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Independent Counsel" shall not include any law firm or person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing any of the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee's right to indemnification under this Agreement. All Expenses of the Independent Counsel incurred in connection with acting pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne by the Company. 
             (v)"Losses" shall mean all liabilities, losses and claims (including judgments, fines, penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) incurred in connection w ith any Proceeding. 
            (vi)"Proceeding" shall include any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, arbitration, mediation, alternate dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, administrative hearing or any other proceeding, whether civil , criminal, administrative or investigative. 
 2.   Service by Indemnitee . Indemnitee agrees to begin or continue to serve the Company or any Affiliate as a director or an executive officer. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, this Agreement shall not create a contract of employment between the Company and Indemnitee, and the termination of Indemnitee's relationship with the Company or an Affiliate by either party hereto shall not be restricted by this Agreement. 
 3.   Indemnification . The Company agrees to indemnify Indemnitee for, and hold Indemnitee harmless from and against, any Losses or Expenses at any time incurred by or assessed against Indemnitee arising out of or in connection with the service of Indemnitee as a director or an executive officer of the Company or in any capacity for an Affiliate at the request of the Company (collectively referred to as a "Director or an Officer of the Company") to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware in effect on the date hereof or as such laws may from time to time hereafter be amended to increase the scope of such permitted indemnification. Without diminishing the scope of the indemnification provided by this Section 3, the rights of indemnification of Indemnitee provided hereunder shall include but shall not be limited to those rights set forth hereinafter. 
 25 

4.    Action or Proceeding Other Than an Action by or in the Right of the Company  . Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided herein if Indemnitee is a perso  n who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any Proceeding, other than an action by or in the right of the Company, as the case may be, by reason of (a) the fact that I  ndemnitee is or was a Director or an Officer of the Company or (b) anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity.  
 5.   Actions by or in the Right of the Company . Indemnitee shall be entitled to the indemnification rights provided herein if Indemnitee is a person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of (a) the fact that Indemnitee is or was a Director or an Officer of the Company or (b) anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity. Pursuant to this Section, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against Losses or Expenses incurred or suffered by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection with the defense or settlement of any Proceeding if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Delaware law expressly prohibits such indemnification by reason of an adjudication of liability of Indemnitee to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such Losses and Expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. 
 6.   Indemnification for Losses and Expenses of Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been wholly successful on the merits or otherwise in any Proceeding referred to in Section 3, 4 or 5 hereof on any claim, issue or matter therein, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Losses and Expenses incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company agrees to indemnify Indemnitee to the maximum extent permitted by law against all Losses and Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter. In any review or Proceeding to determine the extent of indemnification, the Company shall bear the burden of proving any lack of success and which amounts sought in indemnity are allocable to claims, issues or matters which were not successfully resolved. For purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any such claim, issue or matter by dismissal with or without prejudice shall be deemed to be a successful resolution as to such claim, issue or matter. 
 7.   Payment for Expenses of a Witness . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a Director or an Officer of the Company, a witness in any Proceeding, the Company agrees to pay to Indemnitee all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection therewith. 
 26 

8.    Advancement of Expenses  . All Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee (or reasonably expected by Indemnitee to be incurred by Indemnitee with  in three months) in connection with any Proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding within twenty days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting from time to   time such advance or advances, whether or not a determination to indemnify has been made under Section 10. Indemnitee's entitlement to such advancement of Expenses shall include those incurred in connection with any Proceeding by Indemnitee seeking an adju  dication or award in arbitration pursuant to this Agreement. The financial ability of Indemnitee to repay an advance shall not be a prerequisite to the making of such advance. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence such Expenses incurred (o  r reasonably expected to be incurred) by Indemnitee in connection therewith and shall include or be accompanied by a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled   to be indemnified therefor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  
 9.   Guarantee .  In the event that the Company fails or is unable to perform any of its payment obligations under the terms of this Agreement, ECO hereby unconditionally guarantees that it will perform the obligations of the Company and pay Indemnitee for any Losses or Expenses for which Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified or for Expenses to be advanced hereunder.  Such payment will be made promptly upon request and without the necessity of a demand. 
 10.   Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification . 
  (a)When seeking indemnification under this Agreement (which shall not include in any case the right of Indemnitee to receive payments pursuant to Section 7 and Section 8  hereof, which shall not be subject to this Section 10), Indemnitee shall submit a written request for indemnification to the Company. Determination of Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made promptly, but in no event later than 30 days after receipt by the Company of Indemnitee's written request for indemnification. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of Indemnitee's request for indemnification, advise the Board that Indemnitee has made such request for indemnification. 
  (b)The entitlement of Indemnitee to indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined in the specific case (1) by the Board by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (2) if there are no Disintereste d Directors, or if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel or (3) by the stockholders. 
  (c)In the event the determination of entitlement is to be made by Independent Counsel, such Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Indemn itee, subject to the approval of the Board, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.  Upon failure of the Indemnitee to so select such Independent Counsel or upon failure of the Board to so approve, such Independent Counsel shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association of New York, New York or such other person as such Association shall designate to make such selection. 
  (d)If the determination made pursuant to Section 10(b) is that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification to the fu ll extent of Indemnitee's request, Indemnitee shall have the right to seek entitlement to indemnification in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 11 hereof. 
 27 

(e)  If the person or persons empowered pursuant to Section 10(b) to make a determi  nation with respect to entitlement to indemnification shall have failed to make the requested determination within 30 days after receipt by the Company of such request, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have b  een made and Indemnitee shall be absolutely entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) misrepresentation by Indemnitee of a material fact in the request for indemnification or (ii) a final judicial determination that all or any part of such indemnificati  on is expressly prohibited by law.  
  (f)The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the rights of Indemnitee to indemnification  hereunder except as may be specifically provided herein, or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, as the case may be, or create a presumption that (with respect to any criminal action or proceeding) Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful. 
  (g)For purposes of any determination of good faith hereunder, Indemnitee shall be deem ed to have acted in good faith if in taking such action Indemnitee relied on the records or books of account of the Company or an Affiliate, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Company or an Affiliate in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Company or an Affiliate or on information or records given or reports made to the Company or an Affiliate by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care to the Company or an Affiliate. The Company shall have the burden of establishing the absence of good faith. The provisions of this Section 10(g) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement. 
  (h)The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director, officer, agent or employee of the Company or an Affiliat e shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement. 
 11.   Remedies in Cases of Determination Not to Indemnify or to Advance Expenses . 
  (a)In the event that (i) a determination is made that In demnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder, (ii) advances are not made pursuant to Section 8 hereof or (iii) payment has not been timely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification pursuant to Section 10 hereof, Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek a final adjudication either through an arbitration proceeding or in an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction of Indemnitee's entitlement to such indemnification or advance. 
  (b)In  the event a determination has been made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 10 hereof, in whole or in part, that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration referred to in Section 11(a) shall be de novo and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of any such prior determination that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, and the Company shall bear the burdens of proof specified in Sections 6 and 10 hereof in such proceeding. 
 28 

(c)  If   a determination is made or deemed to have been made pursuant to the terms of Section 10 hereof or this Section 11 that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration in   the absence of (i) a misrepresentation of a material fact by Indemnitee or (ii) a final judicial determination that all or any part of such indemnification is expressly prohibited by law.  
  (d)To the extent deemed appropriate by the court, interest shall  be paid by the Company to Indemnitee at a rate equal to the rate paid by the Company or its subsidiaries to the principal senior secured lender thereto for amounts which the Company indemnifies or is obliged to indemnify Indemnitee for the period commencing with the date on which Indemnitee requested indemnification (or reimbursement or advancement of any Expenses) and ending with the date on which such payment is made to Indemnitee by the Company. 
 12.   Expenses Incurred by Indemnitee to Enforce this Agreement . All Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the preparation and submission of Indemnitee's request for indemnification hereunder shall be borne by the Company. In the event that Indemnitee is a party to or intervenes in any proceeding in which the validity or enforceability of this Agreement is at issue or seeks an adjudication to enforce Indemnitee's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, Indemnitee, if Indemnitee prevails in whole in such action, shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee. If it is determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for part (but not all) of the indemnification so requested, Expenses incurred in seeking enforcement of such partial indemnification shall be reasonably prorated among the claims, issues or matters for which Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification and for claims, issues or matters for which Indemnitee is not so entitled. 
 13.   Non-Exclusivity .  The rights of indemnification and to receive advances as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under any law, certificate of incorporation, by-law, other agreement, vote of stockholders or resolution of directors or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitee's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such directorship or office. To the extent Indemnitee would be prejudiced thereby, no amendment, alteration, rescission or replacement of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be effective as to Indemnitee with respect to any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in Indemnitee's position with the Company or an Affiliate or any other entity which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company prior to such amendment, alteration, rescission or replacement. 
 14.   Duration of Agreement . This Agreement shall apply to any claim asserted and any Losses and Expenses incurred in connection with any claim asserted on or after the effective date of this Agreement and shall continue until and terminate upon the later of: (a) ten years after Indemnitee has ceased to occupy any of the positions or have any of the relationships described in Section 3, 4 or 5 hereof; or (b) one year after the final termination of all pending or threatened Proceedings of the kind described herein with respect to Indemnitee. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and Indemnitee's spouse, assigns, heirs, devisee, executors, administrators or other legal representatives. 
 15.   Maintenance of D O Insurance . 
 29 

(a)  The Company hereby covenants and agrees with Indem  nitee that, so long as Indemnitee shall continue to serve as a Director or an Officer of the Company and thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible claim or threatened, pending or completed Proceeding, whether civil, criminal or inve  stigative, by reason of the fact that Indemnitee was a Director or an Officer of the Company or any other entity which Indemnitee was serving at the request of the Company, the Company shall maintain in full force and effect (i) the directors' and officers  ' liability insurance issued by the insurer and having the policy amount and deductible as currently in effect with respect to directors and officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (ii) any replacement or substitute policies issued by one or   more reputable insurers providing in all respects coverage at least comparable to and in the same amount as that currently provided under such existing policy (collectively, "D O Insurance").  
  (b)In all policies of D O Insurance, Indemnitee shall be nam ed as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits, subject to the same limitations, as are accorded to the Company's directors or officers most favorably insured by such policy. 
  (c)Notwithstanding anything to the co ntrary set forth in (a) above, the Company shall have no obligation to maintain D O Insurance if the Company determines in good faith that such insurance is not reasonably available, the premium cost for such insurance is disproportionate to the amount of coverage provided or the coverage provided by such insurance is limited by exclusions so as to provide an insufficient benefit. 
  (d)If the Company ceases to maintain D O Insurance, the Company shall notify Indemnitee in writing of such cessation within t hree (3) calendar days of the earlier of (i) the date the Company determines to cease D O Insurance or (ii) the date D O Insurance ceases.

Exhibit 10.5 
 ESSENDANT INC.   2015 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN   2016 Restricted Stock Award Agreement with EPS Minimum 
   
 This Restricted Stock Award Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated as of  September 1, 2016  (the "Award Date"), is by and between  [[FIRSTNAME]] [[LASTNAME]]    (the "Participant"), and Essendant Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").  Any term capitalized but not defined in this Agreement will have the meaning set forth in the Company s 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). In the exercise of its discretion to deliver stock of the Company, the Committee has determined that the Participant should receive a restricted stock award, on the following terms and conditions: 

1.   
 
  Grant  .  The Company hereby grants to the Participant a Restricted Stock Award (the "Award") of   [[SHARESGRANTED]]     shares of Stock (the "Restricted Shares").  The Award will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement.  The Award constitutes the right, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, to distribution of the Restricted Shares.     

2.   
 
  Stock Certificates  .  The Company will deliver certificates for, or cause its transfer agent to maintain a book entry account reflecting the issuance of, the Restricted Shares in the Participant s name.  The Secretary of the Company, or the Company's transfer agent, will hold the certificates for the Restricted Shares, or cause such Restricted Shares to be maintained as restricted shares in a book entry account, until the Restricted Shares either vest or are forfeited.  Any certificates that are delivered for Restricted Shares will bear a legend, and any book entry accounts that are maintained therefor will have an appropriate notation, in accordance with Section 6 hereof.  The Participant's right to receive the Award hereunder is contingent upon the Participant's execution and delivery to the Secretary of the Company of all stock powers or other instruments of assignment (including a power of attorney), each endorsed in blank with a guarantee of signature if deemed necessary or appropriate by the Company, which would permit transfer to the Company of all or a portion of the Restricted Shares in the event such Restricted Shares are forfeited in whole or in part.  The Company, or its transfer agent, will distribute to the Participant (or, if applicable, the Participant's designated beneficiary or other appropriate recipient in accordance with Section 5 hereof) certificates evidencing ownership of vested Restricted Shares as and when provided in Sections 4 and 5 hereof.     

3.   
 
  Rights as Stockholder  .  On and after the Award Date, and except to the extent provided in this Section 3 and in Section 9 below, the Participant will be entitled to all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Shares, including the right to vote the Restricted Shares, the right to receive dividends and other distributions payable with respect to the Restricted Shares, and the right to participate in any capital adjustment applicable to all holders of Stock.  The Participant will not, however, have the right to receive any regular cash dividend with respect to Restricted Shares that are not yet vested as of the applicable dividend record date, and hereby waives his or her right to receive such dividends with respect to unvested Restricted Shares.      Any dividend or distribution other than a regular cash dividend that is payable or distributable with respect to Restricted Shares that are not yet vested as of the applicable payment date will be deposited with the Company and will be subject to the same restrictions, vesting conditions and other terms of this Agreement to which the underlying Restricted Shares are subject.  If the Participant forfeits any rights he or she may have under this Award in accordance with Section 4 hereof, the Participant shall, on the day following the event of forfeiture, no longer have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any and all Restricted Shares not then vested and so forfeited, or any interest therein, and the Participant shall no longer be entitled to receive dividends on or vote any such Restricted Shares as of any record date occurring thereafter.     

19109v4 

4.   
 
        Vesting; Effect of Date of Termination  .  The Partici  pant's Restricted Shares will vest in three annual increments of one-third of the Restricted Shares on each of September   1, 2017  ,   September  1, 2018  , and   September 1, 2019   (the  Scheduled Vesting Dates ), provided that the Participant s Date of Termination has not occurred before a Scheduled Vesting Date, and provided further that the Company s cumulative Earnings Per Share (as defined in paragraph 4(g)) for the four calend  ar quarters immediately preceding an applicable Scheduled Vesting Date exceeds $0.50 per share.  If the Participant s Date of Termination occurs for any reason before all of the Participant's Restricted Shares have become vested under this Agreement, the P  articipant's Restricted Shares that have not theretofore become vested will be forfeited on and after the Participant's Date of Termination, subject to the following:     

(a)   
 
  If, prior to a Change of Control, the Participant's Date of Termination occurs by reason of the Participant's death or Permanent and Total Disability (as defined in paragraph 4(e)), a portion of the Restricted Shares that have not otherwise vested under this Agreement will become vested as of the Participant's Date of Termination. That portion of the then unvested Restricted Shares shall be determined by multiplying (i) the number of Restricted Shares eligible to vest on the next Scheduled Vesting Date following the Date of Termination by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of whole months elapsed from the Scheduled Vesting Date immediately prior to the Date of Termination (or the Award Date if there was no Scheduled Vesting Date prior to the Date of Termination) to the Date of Termination, and the denominator of which shall be twelve.     

(b)   
 
  If the Participant s Date of Termination occurs by reason of the Participant s Retirement (as defined in paragraph 4(f)), then the unvested Restricted Shares at that time will continue to vest on the remaining Scheduled Vesting Dates to the extent that the Restricted Shares have been earned based on the Company s achievement of the Earnings Per Share goal specified in Section 4 for the four calendar quarters immediately preceding any such Scheduled Vesting Date, but only if the following conditions have been satisfied: (i) the Participant has provided the Company with written notice of his or her intent to retire at least 3 months prior to the Participant s Date of Termination (but such advance notice shall not be required if Retirement occurs as a result of Participant s involuntary termination of employment without Cause, Participant s death or Permanent and Total Disability, or Participant s termination of employment for Good Reason); and (ii) the Participant executes a release of claims and an agreement not to compete in such forms as the Company may reasonably prescribe, and such release and agreement have become fully effective within 60 days following the Participant s Date of Termination.  If these conditions described in the preceding sentence are not satisfied, any unvested Restricted Shares shall be forfeited.     

(c)   
 
    If a Change of Control occurs either (i) after the Award Date and prior to the Participant's Date of Termination, or (ii) after the Participant s Retirement but prior to full vesting hereunder, and if following the Change of Control the surviving company assumes and continues in full force and effect the Company s rights and obligations under this Agreement or substitutes for this Agreement a substantially similar award for the surviving company s stock, then (A) 50% of the Restricted Shares that have not otherwise vested under this Agreement will become fully vested as of the date of such event; and (B) the portion of the Restricted Shares that does not vest in accordance with the preceding clause (A) shall be subject to the vesting provisions of this Agreement without regard to the acceleration of vesting under clause (A).  If following the applicable Change of Control the surviving company does not assume and continue in full force and effect the Company s rights and obligations under this Agreement or substitute for this Agreement a substantially similar award for the surviving company s stock, then 100% of the Restricted Shares that have not otherwise vested under this Agreement will become fully vested as of the date of such event.  For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of

(d)   
 
 If a Change of Control occurs after the Award Date and prior to the Participant's Date of Termination, and if following the Change of Control the surviving company assumes and continues in full force and effect the Company s rights and obligations under this Agreement or substitutes for this Agreement a substantially similar award for the surviving company s stock, and if, during the two-year period following the date of such Change of Control the Participant's Date of Termination occurs by reason of termination of the Participant s employment by the Company or its Subsidiaries without Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason, then the Restricted Shares that have not otherwise vested under this Agreement will be fully vested as of the Participant's Date of Termination.    

(e)   
 
  For purposes of this Agreement, the term  Permanent and Total Disability  means the Participant's inability, due to illness, accident, injury, physical or mental incapacity or other disability, effectively to carry out his or her duties and obligations as an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to participate effectively and actively as an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries for 90 consecutive days or shorter periods aggregating at least 180 days (whether or not consecutive) during any twelve-month period.     

(f)   
 
 For purposes of this Agreement,  Retirement  means the Participant s termination of employment (as described in the definition of  Date of Termination  in the Plan) occurring after the Participant has reached age 60 and, as of such Date of Termination, has completed at least five years of continuous Service with the Company and its Subsidiaries

Except as otherwise specifically provided, the Company will not have any further obligations to the Participant under this Agreement if the Participant s Restricted Shares are forfeited as provided herein.  

5.   
 
    Terms and Conditions of Distribution  .  The Company, or its transfer agent, will distribute to the Participant certificates for any portion of the Restricted Shares which becomes vested in accordance with this Agreement within 30 days after the vesting thereof (except that, to the extent the Participant in eligible for Retirement, such distribution will occur no later than the first March 15 occurring after the applicable Scheduled Vesting Date).

 2016 Long-Term Incentive Grant-EPS Minimum 
 Page 3 of 10 
 
 94014627\V-4   

Company will dist  ribute certificates for that vested portion of the Restricted Shares and, to the extent provided under Section 4 hereof, the remaining balance of the Restricted Shares which become vested upon the Participant s death to the beneficiary designated by the Pa  rticipant, or if no such beneficiary has been designated, to the Participant s estate.     

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may require the Participant, or the alternate recipient identified in the preceding paragraph, to satisfy any potential federal, state, local or other tax withholding liability.  Such liability must be satisfied at the time such Restricted Shares become "substantially vested" (as defined in the regulations issued under Section 83 of the Code).  At the election of the Participant, and subject to such rules and limitations as may be established by the Committee from time to time, such withholding obligations may be satisfied: (a) through a cash payment by the Participant, (b) through the surrender of shares of Stock that the Participant already owns (provided, however, to the extent shares described in this clause (b) are used to satisfy more than the minimum statutory withholding obligation, as described below, then payments made with shares of Stock in accordance with this clause (b) shall be limited to shares held by the Participant for not less than six months prior to the payment date), (c) through the surrender of shares of Stock to which the Participant is otherwise entitled in respect of the Award under this Agreement; provided, however, that such shares under this clause (c) may be used to satisfy not more than the minimum statutory withholding obligation of the Company or applicable Subsidiary (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state and local tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income), or (d) any combination of (a), (b) and (c);  provided ,  however , that the Committee shall have sole discretion to disapprove of an election pursuant to any of clauses (b)-(d) and that the Committee may require that the method of satisfying such an obligation be in compliance with Section 16 of the Exchange Act (if the Participant is subject thereto) and any other applicable laws and the respective rules and regulations thereunder.  Any fraction of a share of Stock which would be required to satisfy such an obligation will be disregarded and the remaining amount due will be paid in cash by the Participant. 
   
 The Company will not be required to make any distribution of any portion of the Restricted Shares under this Section 5 (i) before the first date that such portion of the Restricted Shares may be distributed to the Participant without penalty or forfeiture under federal or state laws or regulations governing short swing trading of securities, or (ii) at any other time when the Company or the Committee reasonably determines that such distribution or any subsequent sale of the Restricted Shares would not be in compliance with other applicable securities or other laws or regulations.  In determining whether a distribution would result in any such penalty, forfeiture or noncompliance, the Company and the Committee may rely upon information reasonably available to them or upon representations of the Participant or the Participant s legal or personal representative. 

6.   
 
  Legend on Stock Certificates  .  If one or more certificates for all or any portion of the Restricted Shares are delivered in the Participant's name under this Agreement before such Restricted Shares become vested, the certificates shall bear the following legend, or any alternate legend that counsel to the Company believes is necessary or desirable, to facilitate compliance with applicable securities or other laws:     

The securities represented by this Certificate are subject to certain restrictions on transfer specified in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement dated as of the Award Date between the issuer (the "Company") and the holder named on this Certificate, and the Company reserves the right to refuse the transfer of such securities, whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, until such conditions have been fulfilled with respect to such transfer.  A copy of such conditions shall be furnished by the Company to the holder hereof upon written request and without charge." 
   
 2016 Long-Term Incentive Grant-EPS Minimum 
 Page 4 of 10 
 
 94014627\V-4   

If any such Restricted Shares are not represented by certificate(s) prior to their vesting, but are instead maintained by the Company s transfer agent in uncertificated form in a book entry account, the account shall bear an appropriate   notation to the effect that the Restricted Shares included therein are subject to the restrictions of this Agreement.  Whether maintained in certificated or uncertificated book entry form, the Company may instruct its transfer agent to impose stop transfe  r instructions with respect to any such unvested Restricted Shares.  
   
 The foregoing legend or notation and stop transfer instructions will be removed from the certificates evidencing or account maintained for all or any portion of the Restricted Shares after the conditions set forth in Sections 4 and 5 hereof have been satisfied as to such Restricted Shares. 

7.   
 
  Delivery of Certificates  .  Despite the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 hereof, the Company is not required to deliver any certificates for Restricted Shares if at any time the Company determines that the listing, registration or qualification of such Restricted Shares upon any securities exchange or under any law, the consent or approval of any governmental body or the taking of any other action is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the delivery of the Restricted Shares hereunder in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent, approval or other action has been effected or obtained, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company.     

8.   
 
    Restrictive Covenants and Trade Secrets; Recovery of Payments  . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, the Company may recover the Award granted or paid under this Agreement to the extent required by the terms of any clawback or compensation recovery policy adopted by the Company. Furthermore, and in consideration of the grant of the Award under the terms of this Agreement and in recognition of the fact that Participant has received and will receive Confidential Information (as defined in paragraph 8(e)(iv)) and trade secrets (as defined under applicable law) during Participant s Service (as defined in paragraph 8(e)(v)), Participant agrees to be bound by the restrictive covenants set forth in paragraphs 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and 8(d), below (the  Restrictive Covenants ).  In addition, but subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, Participant agrees that if Participant violates any provision of such Restrictive Covenants or applicable trade secret law with respect to trade secrets of the Company, then (i) all unvested Restricted Shares shall immediately be forfeited back to the Company, and (ii) any Restricted Shares that have vested at any time during the three-year period immediately preceding the date on which such violation occurred shall immediately be forfeited back to the Company (collectively, the  Forfeited Shares ).  Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, Participant hereby agrees that upon demand from the Company at any time after discovery of the violation of a Restrictive Covenant or applicable trade secret law with respect to trade secrets of the Company or imposition of a claw back, (A) Participant shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the proceeds Participant has received from any sales or distributions of Forfeited Shares, and (B) if Participant still holds all or any part of the Forfeited Shares at the time the Company makes such demand, Participant shall either (1) deliver to the Company all such unsold Forfeited Shares or (2) pay to the Company the aggregate fair market value of such Forfeited Shares as of the date of the Participant s receipt of the Company s demand.  Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph and any applicable limitations of Code Section 409A, by accepting this Agreement, Participant consents to a deduction from any amounts the Company owes Participant from time to time (including amounts owed to Participant as wages or other compensation, fringe benefits, or vacation pay, as well as any other amounts owed to Participant by the Company), to the extent of the amounts Participant owes the Company under this Section 8. Whether or not the Company elects to make any set-off in whole or in part, if the Company does not recover by means of set-off the full amount Participant owes pursuant to this Section 8, Participant hereby agrees to pay immediately the unpaid balance to the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and to the extent that a violation of a Restrictive Covenant or applicable trade secret law with respect to trade secrets of the Company is curable at the time of discovery by the Company, Participant will not be deemed to have violated such Restrictive Covenant or trade secrets law unless and until      

 2016 Long-Term Incentive Grant-EPS Minimum 
 Page 5 of 10 
 
 94014627\V-4   

the Company gives Participant written notice of such violation and Participant fails to cure such violation within 30 calendar days after receip  t of such written notice.     

(a)   
 
  Confidential Information and Trade Secrets . Participant acknowledges that during the course of his or her Service, he or she has received and will receive Confidential Information and trade secrets. Participant further acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of the Company s Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Policy.

The foregoing restriction shall apply at all times during Participant s Service with the Company and for a period of five years following termination thereof for any reason, unless such Confidential Information qualifies as a trade secret or is a third-party s confidential information in which case the foregoing restriction shall continue for so long as the Company trade secrets remain secret and the Company remains obligated to protect the third-party confidential information.     

(b)   
 
  Competitive Activities .  During Participant s Service and for two years after the termination of Participant s Service for any reason whatsoever (including Retirement), Participant shall not engage in any Competitive Activity (as defined in paragraph 8(e)(iii)).  Participant s obligations under this paragraph 8(b) shall apply in any geographic territory in which the Company conducts its business during the term of the Participant s Service. To the extent Participant worked in a sales capacity for the Company, Participant s obligations under this Section 8(b) shall apply in any geographic territory in which Participant sold products and/or services on behalf of the Company during the last two years of Participant s employment with the Company.  In the event that any portion of this paragraph 8(b) shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it is unreasonably restrictive in any respect, it shall be interpreted to extend over the maximum period of time for which it reasonably may be enforced and to the maximum extent for which it reasonably may be enforced in all other respects, and enforced as so interpreted, all as determined by such court in such action.  Participant acknowledges the uncertainty of the law in this respect and expressly stipulates that this Agreement is to be given the construction that renders its provisions valid and enforceable to the maximum extent (not exceeding its express terms) possible under applicable law.      

(c)

(ii)

(v)

(vi)   
 
 assist, solicit, or encourage any other person, directly or indirectly, in carrying out any activity set forth above that would be prohibited by any of the provisions of this Agreement if such activity were carried out by Participant. In particular, Participant will not, directly or indirectly, induce any Service Provider of the Company to carry out any such activity.    

(d)   
 
  Other Restricted Activities .  During Participant s Service and for two years after the termination of Participant s Service for any reason whatsoever, Participant shall not engage in any other activity that is inimical, contrary or harmful to the interests of the Company including, but not limited to, (i) conduct related to Participant s Service for which either criminal or civil penalties against Participant may be sought, (ii) violation of Company policies, including, without limitation, the Company's insider trading policy, or (iii) participating in a hostile takeover attempt.

(iii)   
 
   The term  Competitive Activity  shall mean directly or indirectly investing in, owning, operating, financing, controlling, or providing services to a Competing Business if the nature of such services are the same as or similar in position scope and geographic scope to any position held by Participant during the last two years of his or her employment with the Company, such that Participant s engaging in such services on behalf of a Competing Business does or may pose competitive harm to the Company,  provided  that passive investments of less than

 The term  Confidential Information  has the meaning set forth in the Company s Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Policy.  Confidential Information includes not only information contained in written or digitized Company documents but also all such information that Participant may commit to memory during the course of his or her Service.

In the event of a violation of any provision of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this Section 8, the period for which those provisions would remain in effect shall be extended for a period of time equal to that period beginning when such violation commenced and ending when the activities constituting such violation have been finally terminated.  Participant is aware that there may be defenses to the enforceability of the Restrictive Covenants set forth in this Section 8, based on time, activity or territory considerations, and Participant knowingly, consciously, intentionally, entirely voluntarily, and irrevocably waives any and all such defenses and agrees that he or she will not assert the same in any action or other proceeding brought by the Company for the purpose of enforcing the Restrictive Covenants.     

(g)

Exhibit 10.6 
 ESSENDANT INC.  
 2015 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN  
 Performance Based Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement  
 This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (this  Agreement ), dated  March 15, 2016  (the  Award Date ), is by and between  [[FIRSTNAME]] [[LASTNAME]]  (the  Participant ), and Essendant Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ). Any term capitalized but not defined in this Agreement will have the meaning set forth in the Company s 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  Plan ).  
 In the exercise of its discretion to grant awards under the Plan, the Committee has determined that the Participant should receive an award of restricted stock units ( Units ) under the Plan, on the following terms and conditions:  

1.   
 
  Grant . The Company hereby grants to the Participant a Restricted Stock Unit Award (the  Award ) consisting of  [[SHARESGRANTED]]  Units (the  Target Number of Units ), subject to possible increase to as many as two times the Target Number of Units (the  Maximum Number of Units ), or decrease to as low as zero, depending on the degree to which the Company has satisfied the performance goals specified in  Appendix A  to this Agreement. Each Unit that vests represents the right to receive one share of the Company s common stock as provided in Section 5 of this Agreement. The Award will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement.    

2.   
 
  No Rights as a Stockholder . The Units granted pursuant to this Award do not entitle the Participant to any rights of a stockholder of the Company unless and until the Units vest as set forth in Section 3 and the Company has caused the Stock to be delivered as set forth in Section 5. The Participant s rights with respect to the Units shall remain forfeitable at all times until satisfaction of the vesting conditions set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement.    

3.   
 
  Vesting; Effect of Date of Termination . For purposes of this Agreement,  Vesting Date  means the earlier of  March 1, 2019 , or such other date upon which a vesting event occurs pursuant to this Section 3.    

(a)   
 
 Units will vest on the Vesting Date (i) if the Participant s Date of Termination has not occurred before the Vesting Date, and (ii) only to the extent the Units have been earned as provided in Section 4 during the period (the  Performance Period ) from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018 (the  Determination Date ).  The period from the Award Date through the Vesting Date is referred to as the  Vesting Period.  Except as provided in paragraphs 3(b) through 3(f), if the Participant s Date of Termination occurs for any reason during the Vesting Period, the Participant s Units that have not yet vested will be forfeited as of the Participant s Date of Termination.    

(b)   
 
 If the Participant s Date of Termination occurs during the Vesting Period, but prior to a Change of Control, by reason of the Participant s death or Permanent and Total Disability (as defined in paragraph 3(f)), a portion of the then unvested Units subject to this Award will become vested as of the Participant s Date of Termination. That portion shall be equal to a number of Units determined by multiplying the Target Number of Units by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of whole months elapsed from the Award Date through the Date of Termination, and the denominator of which shall be 36. Any remaining Units subject to this Award that do not vest as provided in this paragraph shall be forfeited as of the Participant s Date of Termination.    

(c)   
 
   If the Participant s Date of Termination occurs during the Vesting Period, but prior to a Change of Control, by reason of the Participant s Retirement (as defined in paragraph 3(h)), then except as provided in paragraph 3(d), the Units will remain outstanding until the Vesting Date, at which point a prorated portion of the unvested Units will vest to the extent that the Units have been earned as provided in Section 4 during the Performance Period, but only if the following conditions have been satisfied: (i) the Participant has provided the Company with written notice of his or her intent     

 A-1 

Exhibit 10.6 

to retire at least 3 months prior to the Participant s Date of Termination (but such advance notice shall not be required if Retirement occurs as a result of the Participant s involuntary Separation fr  om Service without Cause or the Participant s Separation from Service for Good Reason); and (ii) the Participant executes a release of claims and an agreement not to compete in such forms as the Company may prescribe, and such release and agreement have be  come fully effective, within 60 days following the Participant s Date of Termination.  If the conditions described in the preceding sentence are not satisfied, any unvested Units as of the Date of Termination shall be forfeited.  The proration described in   this paragraph 3(c) shall be accomplished as follows:  (i) following the Determination Date, the Committee shall determine the number of Units that the Participant would have earned pursuant to Section 4 if he or she had remained employed through the Vest  ing Date, then (ii) that number of Units shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months occurring between the Award Date and the Participant s Date of Termination, and the denominator of which is 36.     

(d)   
 
 If (i) a Change of Control occurs during the Vesting Period and prior to the Participant s Date of Termination, or (ii) a Change of Control occurs after the Participant s Retirement, but prior to the Determination Date, then in either case the Target Number of Units will become fully vested as of the date of such Change of Control.  For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph 3(d) will apply after the Participant s Retirement only if the conditions set forth in paragraph 3(c) have been satisfied in connection with such Retirement.    

(e)   
 
 If (i) the Participant s Date of Termination occurs during the Vesting Period, but prior to a Change of Control, as a result of the Participant s involuntary Separation from Service without Cause or the Participant s Separation from Service for Good Reason (but excluding the Participant s Retirement if the conditions in paragraph 3(c) are satisfied in connection with such Retirement), (ii) a Change of Control then occurs within six months following the Participant s Date of Termination, and (iii) the Committee determines that there is clear evidence that the Participant s termination of employment was made in contemplation of the Change of Control, then a number of shares of Stock (subject to paragraph 5.2(f) of the Plan) be equal to the Target Number of Units shall be delivered to the Participant on a fully vested basis promptly, but in no event later than two and one-half months after the end of the calendar year in which the Change of Control occurs.    

(f)   
 
 For purposes of this Agreement, the term  Permanent and Total Disability  means the Participant s inability, due to illness, accident, injury, physical or mental incapacity or other disability, effectively to carry out his duties and obligations as an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to participate effectively and actively as an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries for 90 consecutive days or shorter periods aggregating at least 180 days (whether or not consecutive) during any twelve-month period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to cause the Award to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the  Code ),  Permanent and Total Disability  shall mean a  disability  as described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(4).    

(g)   
 
 For purposes of this Agreement, a Date of Termination shall be deemed to have occurred only if on such date the Participant has also experienced a  separation from service  as defined in the regulations promulgated under Code Section 409A (a  Separation from Service ).    

(h)   
 
 For purposes of this Agreement,  Retirement  means the Participant s Separation from Service occurring after the Participant has reached age 60 and, as of the applicable Date of Termination, has completed at least five years of continuous service with the Company and its Subsidiaries.    

(i)   
 
 For purposes of this Agreement, a Change of Control shall be deemed to have occurred only if such event would also be deemed to constitute a  change in control event  (as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i)) with respect to the Company.    

 A-2 

Exhibit 10.6 
    Except as otherwise specifically provided, the Company will not have any further obligations to the Participant under this Agreement if the Participant s Units are forfeited as provided   herein.   

4.   
 
  Earned Units . Except as specifically provided in Section 3, the number of Units subject to this Award that the Participant will be deemed to have earned ( Earned Units ) and that are eligible for vesting as of the Vesting Date will be determined by the extent to which the Company has satisfied the performance goals for the Performance Period ending on the Determination Date as set forth in  Appendix A  to this Agreement. The portion of the Units subject to this Award that will be deemed Earned Units as of the Vesting Date during the Vesting Period will be determined according to the formula specified in  Appendix A , but in no event will the cumulative number of Units that are deemed Earned Units exceed the Maximum Number of Units.  Any Units that are not earned and do not vest as of the Vesting Date will be forfeited.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce the number of Earned Units that would otherwise be deemed vested as of the Vesting Date in recognition of such performance or other factors that the Committee deems relevant.    

5.   
 
  Settlement of Units . After any Units vest pursuant to Section 3, the Company will promptly, but in no event later than two and one-half months after the applicable Vesting Date, cause to be delivered to the Participant, or to the Participant s beneficiary or legal representative in the event of Participant s death, one share of Stock in payment and settlement of each Earned Unit. Such issuance shall be evidenced by a stock certificate or appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, shall be subject to the tax withholding provisions of Section 6, and shall be in complete satisfaction of the Units subject to this Award. If the Units that vest include a fractional Unit, the Company will round the number of vested Units down to the nearest whole Unit prior to issuance of the shares as provided herein.  To the greatest extent possible, it is intended that this Award and any payments made in connection herewith shall be exempt from, or comply with, Code Section 409A, and this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with that intent.  Notwithstanding the payment timing provisions otherwise set forth in this Section 5, if any amount shall be payable with respect to this Award as a result of the Participant s Separation from Service at such time as the Participant is a  specified employee  (as those terms are defined in regulations promulgated under Code Section 409A) and such amount is subject to the provisions of Code Section 409A, then no payment shall be made, except as permitted under Code Section 409A, prior to the first day of the seventh calendar month beginning after the Participant s Separation from Service (or the date of Participant s earlier death), or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.    

6.   
 
  Tax Matters . The Committee may require the Participant, or the alternate recipient identified in Section 5, to satisfy any potential federal, state, local or other tax withholding liability. Such liability must be satisfied at the time such Units are settled in shares of Stock. At the election of the Participant, and subject to such rules and limitations as may be established by the Committee from time to time, such withholding obligations may be satisfied: (i) through a cash payment by the Participant, (ii) through the surrender of shares of Stock that the Participant already owns, (iii) through the surrender of shares of Stock to which the Participant is otherwise entitled in respect of the Award under this Agreement; provided, however, that such shares under this clause (iii) may be used to satisfy not more than the minimum statutory withholding obligation of the Company or applicable Subsidiary (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state and local tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income), or (iv) any combination of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii);  provided ,  however , that the Committee shall have sole discretion to disapprove of an election pursuant to any of clauses (ii)-(iv) and that the Committee may require that the method of satisfying such an obligation be in compliance with Section 16 of the Exchange Act (if the Participant is subject thereto) and any other applicable laws and the respective rules and regulations thereunder. Any fraction of a share of Stock which would be required to satisfy such an obligation will be disregarded and the remaining amount due will be paid in cash by the Participant.    

 A-3 

Exhibit 10.6 

7.   
 
        Compliance with Laws  . Despite the provisions of Section 5 hereof, the Company is not required to deliver any certificates for shares of Stock if at any time the Company determines that the listing, registration or qua  lification of such shares upon any securities exchange or under any law, the consent or approval of any governmental body or the taking of any other action is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the issuance or delivery of the   shares hereunder in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent, approval or other action has been effected or obtained, free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company.     

8.   
 
  Restrictive Covenants; Recovery of Payments . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, the Company may recover the Award granted or paid under this Agreement to the extent required by the terms of any clawback or compensation recovery policy adopted by the Company. Furthermore, and in consideration of the grant of the Award under the terms of this Agreement and in recognition of the fact that Participant has received and will receive Confidential Information (as defined in paragraph 8(e)(iv)) during Participant s Service (as defined in paragraph 8(e)(v)), Participant agrees to be bound by the restrictive covenants set forth in paragraphs 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and 8(d), below (the  Restrictive Covenants ).  In addition, but subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, Participant agrees that if Participant violates any provision of such Restrictive Covenants, then (i) all unvested Units shall immediately become null and void, and (ii) any shares of Stock delivered upon vesting of any Units at any time during the three-year period immediately preceding the date on which such violation occurred shall immediately become null and void (collectively, the  Forfeited Shares ). Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, Participant hereby agrees that upon demand from the Company at any time after discovery of the violation of a Restrictive Covenant or other imposition of a claw back, (A) Participant shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the proceeds Participant has received from any sales or distributions of Forfeited Shares, and (B) if Participant still holds all or any part of the Forfeited Shares at the time the Company makes such demand, Participant shall either (1) deliver to the Company all such unsold Forfeited Shares or (2) pay to the Company the aggregate fair market value of such Forfeited Shares as of the date of the Participant s receipt of the Company s demand.  Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph and any applicable limitations of Code Section 409A, by accepting this Agreement, Participant consents to a deduction from any amounts the Company owes Participant from time to time (including amounts owed to Participant as wages or other compensation, fringe benefits, or vacation pay, as well as any other amounts owed to Participant by the Company), to the extent of the amounts Participant owes the Company under this Section 8. Whether or not the Company elects to make any set-off in whole or in part, if the Company does not recover by means of set-off the full amount Participant owes pursuant to this Section 8, Participant hereby agrees to pay immediately the unpaid balance to the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and to the extent that a violation of a Restrictive Covenant is curable at the time of discovery by the Company, Participant will not be deemed to have violated such Restrictive Covenant unless and until the Company gives Participant written notice of such violation and Participant fails to cure such violation within 30 calendar days after receipt of such written notice.    

(a)   
 
  Confidential Information . Participant acknowledges that during the course of his or her Service, he or she has received and will receive Confidential Information.  Participant further acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of the Company s Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Policy.  Participant acknowledges and agrees that it is his or her responsibility to protect the integrity and confidential nature of the Confidential Information, both during and after his or her Service, and Participant shall not directly or indirectly use, disclose, disseminate, or otherwise make available any such Confidential Information, either during or after the term of his or her Service, except as necessary for the performance of his or her duties to the Company or as expressly permitted in writing by the Company.    

(b)   
 
    Competitive Activities .  During Participant s Service and for two years after the termination of Participant s Service for any reason whatsoever (including Retirement), Participant shall not engage in any Competitive Activity (as defined in paragraph 8(e)(iii)).  Participant s obligations under this paragraph 8(b) shall apply in any geographic territory in which the Company conducts     

 A-4 

Exhibit 10.6 

its business during the term of the Participant s Service.  In the event that any por  tion of this paragraph 8(b) shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it is unreasonably restrictive in any respect, it shall be interpreted to extend over the maximum period of time for which it reasonably may   be enforced and to the maximum extent for which it reasonably may be enforced in all other respects, and enforced as so interpreted, all as determined by such court in such action.  Participant acknowledges the uncertainty of the law in this respect and ex  pressly stipulates that this Agreement is to be given the construction that renders its provisions valid and enforceable to the maximum extent (not exceeding its express terms) possible under applicable law.       

(c)   
 
  Non-Solicitation . During Participant s Service and for two years after the  termination of Participant s Service for any reason whatsoever, Participant shall not:    

(i)   
 
 solicit, induce or attempt to solicit or induce any employee, consultant, or independent contractor of the Company (each, a  Service Provider ) to leave or otherwise terminate such Service Provider s relationship with the Company, or in any way interfere adversely with the relationship between any such Service Provider and the Company;    

(ii)   
 
 solicit, induce or attempt to solicit or induce any Service Provider to work for, render services to, provide advice to, or supply Confidential Information or trade secrets of the Company to any third person, firm, or entity;    

(iii)   
 
 employ, or otherwise pay for services rendered by, any Service Provider in any business enterprise with which Participant may be associated, connected or affiliated;    

(iv)   
 
 call upon, induce or attempt to induce any current or potential customer, vendor, supplier, licensee, licensor or other business relation of the Company for the purpose of soliciting or selling products or services in direct competition with the Company or to induce any such person to cease or refrain from doing business with the Company, or in any way interfere with the then-existing or potential business relationship between any such current or potential customer, vendor, supplier, licensee, licensor or other business relation and the Company;     

(v)   
 
 call upon any entity that is a prospective acquisition candidate that Participant knows or has reason to know was called upon by the Company or for which the Company made an acquisition analysis for the purpose of acquiring such entity; or    

(vi)   
 
 assist, solicit, or encourage any other person, directly or indirectly, in carrying out any activity set forth above that would be prohibited by any of the provisions of this Agreement if such activity were carried out by Participant. In particular, Participant will not, directly or indirectly, induce any Service Provider of the Company to carry out any such activity.    

(d)   
 
  Other Restricted Activities .  During Participant s Service and for two years after the later of (i) termination of Participant s Service for any reason whatsoever or (ii) the Vesting Date, Participant shall not engage in any other activity that is inimical, contrary or harmful to the interests of the Company including, but not limited to, (i) conduct related to Participant s Service for which either criminal or civil penalties against Participant may be sought, (ii) violation of Company policies, including, without limitation, the Company's insider trading policy, or (iii) participating in a hostile takeover attempt.     

(e)   
 
  Definitions . For purposes of this Section 8, the following terms shall have the following definitions:    

(i)   
 
 The term  Company  shall include any Subsidiary of the Company that may exist at a given time.    

 A-5 

Exhibit 10.6 

(ii)   
 
        The term  Competing Business  shall mean any business activities that are directly or indirectly competitive with the business conducted by the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the date of the termination of Participant s Se  rvice, all as described in the Company s periodic reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act (e.g., the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K) or other comparable publicly disseminated information.      

(iii)   
 
 The term  Competitive Activity  shall mean directly or indirectly investing in, owning, operating, financing, controlling, or providing services that are the same as or similar to a Competing Business if the nature of such services are similar in position scope and geographic scope to any position held by Participant during the last two years of his or her employment with the Company, such that Participant s engaging in such services on behalf of a Competing Business does or may pose competitive harm to the Company,  provided  that passive investments of less than 2% ownership interest in any entity that is a Competing Business will not be considered to be a  Competitive Activity.     

(iv)   
 
 The term  Confidential Information  has the meaning set forth in the Company s Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Policy.  Confidential Information includes not only information contained in written or digitized Company documents but also all such information that Participant may commit to memory during the course of his or her Service.  Confidential Information  does not include information that is available in reasonably similar form to the general public through no fault of Participant, or that was received by Participant outside of the Company, without an obligation of confidentiality.    

(v)   
 
 Participant will be deemed to be in  Service  to the Company so long as he or she renders continuous servic es on a periodic basis to the Company in the capacity of an employee, director, consultant, independent contractor, or other advisor (but, in the case of Participant s continued Service as a consultant, independent contractor, or other advisor, only as determined by the Committee or the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, following Participant s initial Service as an employee or director).       

(f)   
 
  Equitable Relief; Enforceability .  By accepting this Agreement and the Units granted hereby, Participant agrees that the Restrictive Covenants set forth in this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company. In the event a violation of any of the restrictions contained in this Section 8 is established, the Company shall be entitled to seek enforcement of the provisions of this Section 8 through proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction, including preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.  In the event of a violation of any provision of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this Section 8, the period for which those provisions would remain in effect shall be extended for a period of time equal to that period beginning when such violation commenced and ending when the activities constituting such violation have been finally terminated in good faith.  Participant is aware that there may be defenses to the enforceability of the Restrictive Covenants set forth in this Section 8, based on time or territory considerations, and Participant knowingly, consciously, intentionally, entirely voluntarily, and irrevocably waives any and all such defenses and agrees that he or she will not assert the same in any action or other proceeding brought by the Company for the purpose of enforcing the Restrictive Covenants.      

9.   
 
  No Right to Employment . Nothing herein confers upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary.    

10.   
 
    Nontransferability . Except as otherwise provided by the Committee or as provided in Section 5, and except with respect to shares of Stock delivered in settlement of vested Units, the Participant s interests and rights in and under this Agreement may not be assigned, transferred, exchanged, pledged or otherwise encumbered other than as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

 A-6 

Exhibit 10.6 

the designated beneficiary or other appropriate recipient in accordance with Section 5 hereof. The Committe  e may require personal receipts or endorsements of a Participant s personal representative, designated beneficiary or alternate recipient provided for herein, and the Committee shall extend to those individuals the rights otherwise exercisable by the Parti  cipant with regard to any withholding tax election in accordance with Section 6 hereof. Any effort to otherwise assign or transfer any Units or any rights or interests therein or thereto under this Agreement will be wholly ineffective, and will be grounds   for termination by the Committee of all rights and interests of the Participant and his or her beneficiary in and under this Agreement.     

11.   
 
  Administration and Interpretation . The Committee has the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan and to make all interpretations and determinations necessary or appropriate for the administration of the Plan and this Agreement, including the enforcement of any recovery of payments pursuant to Section 8 or otherwise. Any interpretations of the Plan or this Agreement by the Committee and any decisions made by it under the Plan or this Agreement are final and binding on the Participant and all other persons. Any inconsistency between this Agreement and the Plan shall be resolved in favor of the Plan except to the extent such resolution would result in a violation of Code Section 409A.    

12.   
 
  Governing Law . This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of law of Delaware or any other jurisdiction.

In addition, this Agreement and the Participant s rights hereunder shall be subject to all interpretations, determinations, guidelines, rules and regulations adopted or made by the Committee from time to time pursuant to the Plan. This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties to it with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior oral and written discussions, commitments, undertakings, representations or agreements (including, without limitation, any terms of any employment offers, discussions or agreements between the parties).    

14.   
 
  Binding Effect . This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Company and the Participant and, as and to the extent provided herein and under the Plan, their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns.    

15.   
 
  Amendment and Waiver . This Agreement may be amended in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, and may otherwise be amended by written agreement between the Company and the Participant without the consent of any other person.

Exhibit 10.6 
    APPENDIX A  
 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement  
 Earned Units and Performance Goals  
   
 Vesting Period: March 15, 2016 through March 1, 2019 
 The determination of the number of Units that will be earned and vested as of the Vesting Date as provided in Section 3 of the Agreement will be determined as follows:  

1.   
 
 The Company s Cumulative Adjusted Net Income (as defined below), Working Capital Efficiency (as defined below) and TSR Percentile Rank (as defined below) for the Performance Period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on the Determination Date will be calculated.    

2.   
 
 Based on that actual Cumulative Net Income, Working Capital Efficiency and TSR Percentile Rank, the Performance Factors for the Performance Period will be determined from the following table by determining where each of the Company s actual Cumulative Adjusted Net Income, Working Capital Efficiency and TSR Percentile Rank falls relative to the performance goals specified in the applicable column of the table below, and then selecting the corresponding Performance Factor. If the Company s actual results for the Performance Period are between two amounts shown in the applicable column of the table, the corresponding Performance Factor will be determined by linear interpolation between the two relevant Performance Factors shown in the table. If actual results for the Performance Period are less than or equal to the Minimum amount specified, the corresponding Performance Factor is zero, and if actual results for the Performance Period are greater than the Maximum amount specified, the corresponding Performance Factor will be equal to the percentage specified for the Maximum amount.    

 Company s Cumulative Adjusted Net Income, Working Capital Efficiency, and TSR Percentile Rank Performance Goals and Corresponding Performance Factors during the Performance Period 

3.   
 
 The number of Earned Units during the Performance Period that will vest as of the Vesting Date will be calculated using the following formula:    

 (Performance Factor for Cumulative Adjusted Net Income x Target Number of Units x 0.60) + 
 (Performance Factor for Working Capital Efficiency x Target Number of Units x 0.25) + 
 (Performance Factor for TSR Percentile Rank x Target Number of Units x 0.15) where: 

Performance Factor for Cumulative Adjusted Net Income ,  Performance Factor for Working Capital Efficiency  and  Performance Factor for TSR Percentile Rank  are the percentages determined as provided in item 2 above; and     

A-9 

Exhibit 10.6 

Target Number of Units  is the number associated with that term in Section 1 of the Agreement.     

4.   
 
  For purposes of this Appendix A, the Company s  Working Capital Efficiency  for the Performance Period shall mean the monthly average of total current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) less total current liabilities (excluding short term debt), divided by net sales, and the Company s  Cumulative Adjusted Net Income  for the Performance Period shall mean the sum of the adjusted net income for each of the three years in such period, all as reported in the Company s 2016 through 2018 quarterly earnings releases in the table titled Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Adjusted Operating Income, Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share and re-calculated based on accounting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or similar accounting standards body in place as of December 31, 2015, and adjusted to eliminate the effects of any and all of the following (net of any tax effects) to the extent not already included in the aforementioned table: (i) write-offs of previously capitalized financing costs; (ii) subsidiary charitable contributions to the Essendant Charitable Foundation; (iii) projected impacts on financial results of any acquisition or disposition (including liquidation of at least 90% of the assets) of any business during the Performance Period as reflected in the final financial valuation of the transaction presented to the Board prior to the Board s approval of the transaction; (iv) impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets (as defined by ASC 350); (v) curtailment, settlement or termination of any of the Company s pension plans (as defined in ASC 715); (vi) litigation or claim judgments and settlements; and (vii) restructuring costs (as defined by ASC 420).  The Company s   TSR Percentile Rank  shall mean the percentile ranking of the Company s TSR among the TSRs for the Comparative Group members for the Performance Period.  TSR Percentile Rank is determined by ordering the Comparative Group members (plus the Company if the Company is not one of the Comparative Group members) from highest to lowest based on TSR for the Performance Period and counting down from the company with the highest TSR (ranked first) to the Company s position on the list. If two companies are ranked equally, the ranking of the next company shall account for the tie, so that if one company is ranked first, and two companies are tied for second, the next company is ranked fourth. In determining the Company s TSR Percentile Rank for the Performance Period, in the event that the Company s TSR for the Performance Period is equal to the TSR(s) of one or more other Comparative Group members for that same period, the Company s TSR Percentile Rank ranking will be determined by ranking the Company s TSR for that period as being greater than such other Comparative Group members. After this ranking, the TSR Percentile Rank will be calculated using the following formula, rounded to the nearest whole percentile by application of regular rounding:    

N  represents the number of Comparative Group members for the Performance Period (plus the Company if the Company is not one of the Comparative Group). 
   
  R  represents the Company s ranking among the Comparative Group members (plus the Company if the Company is not one of the Comparative Group members). 

A-10 

Exhibit 10.6 
    For purpose  s of this Appendix A, the following terms shall have the following definitions tied to TSR Percentile Rank:  
  Beginning Price  means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparative Group member, the ending stock price on the first day of trading in 2016. For the purpose of determining Beginning Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the ex-dividend date. 
  Ending Price  means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparative Group member, the ending stock price on the last trading date in 2018. For the purpose of determining Ending Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the ex-dividend date.  
   Comparative Group  means the Company and each company included on Annex A attached hereto, provided that, except as provided below, the common stock (or similar equity security) of such company is continually listed or traded on a national securities exchange from the first day of the Performance Period through the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event a member of the Comparative Group files for bankruptcy or liquidates due to an insolvency or is delisted due to failure to meet the national securities exchange s minimum market capitalization requirement, such company shall continue to be treated as a Comparative Group member, and such company s Ending Price will be treated as $0 if the common stock (or similar equity security) of such company is no longer listed or traded on a national securities exchange on the last trading day of the Performance Period (and if multiple members of the Comparative Group file for bankruptcy or liquidate due to an insolvency or are delisted, such members shall be ranked in order of when such bankruptcy or liquidation occurs, with earlier bankruptcies/liquidations/delistings ranking lower than later bankruptcies/liquidations/delistings). In the event of a formation of a new parent company by a Comparative Group member, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of which consist immediately after the transaction of the equity interests in the original Comparative Group member or the assets and liabilities of such Comparative Group member immediately prior to the transaction, such new parent company shall be substituted for the Comparative Group member to the extent (and for such period of time) as its common stock (or similar equity securities) are listed or traded on a national securities exchange but the common stock (or similar equity securities) of the original Comparative Group member are not. In the event of a merger or other business combination of two Comparative Group members (including, without limitation, the acquisition of one Comparative Group member, or all or substantially all of its assets, by another Comparative Group member), the surviving, resulting or successor entity, as the case may be, shall continue to be treated as a member of the Comparative Group, provided that the common stock (or similar equity security) of such entity is listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. With respect to the preceding two sentences, the applicable stock prices shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted to the extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of the transaction. 
  Total Shareholder Return  or    TSR    shall be determined with respect to the Company and any other Comparative Group member by dividing: (a) the sum of (i) the difference obtained by subtracting the applicable Beginning Price from the applicable Ending Price plus (ii) all dividends and other distributions on the respective shares with an ex-dividend date that falls during the Performance Period by (b) the applicable Beginning Price. Any non-cash distributions shall be valued at fair market value. For the purpose of determining TSR, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.

Exhibit 10.6 

Assume the following facts: (i) the Target Number of Units is 15,000; (ii) the Company s actual Cumulative Adjusted Net Income for the Performance Period was half-way between the Minimum amount and the Target amount, resulting in a Performance Factor for Cumulative Adjusted Net Income of 50%; (iii) the Company s actual Working Capital Efficiency for the Performance Period was half-way between the Minimum percentage and the Target percentage, resulting in a Performance Factor for Working Capital Efficiency of 50%; and (iv) the Company s actual TSR Percentile Rank for the Performance Period was half-way between the Minimum percentile and the Target percentile, resulting in a Performance Factor for TSR Percentile Rank of 50%.  Under these facts, the number of Earned Units that would vest as of the Vesting Date would be:     

 (0.50 x 15,000 x 0.60) + (0.50 x 15,000 x 0.25) + (0.50 x 15,000 x 0.15) = 4,500 + 1,875 + 1,125 = 7,500 

Assume the following facts: (i) the Target Number of Units is 10,000; (ii) the Company s actual Cumulative Net Income for the Performance Period was half-way between the Target amount and the Maximum amount, resulting in a Performance Factor for Cumulative Adjusted Net Income of 150%; (iii) the Company s actual Working Capital Efficiency for the Performance Period was half-way between the Target percentage and the Maximum percentage, resulting in a Performance Factor for Working Capital Efficiency of 150%; and (iv) the Company s actual TSR Percentile Rank for the Performance Period was half-way between the Target percentile and the Maximum percentile, resulting in a Performance Factor for TSR Percentile Rank of 150%.  Under these facts, the number of Earned Units that would vest as of the Vesting Date would be:     

 (1.50 x 10,000 x 0.60) + (1.50 x 10,000 x 0.25) + (1.50 x 10,000 x 0.15) = 9,000 + 3,750 + 2,250 = 15,000
