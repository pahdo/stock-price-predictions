Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

1.    Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Ferro Corporation ( Ferro,   we,   us  or  the Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q, and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. These statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

The Company owned     51%   of an operatin  g affiliate in Venezuela that was   a consolidated subsidiary of Ferro.    During the fourth quarter of 2015, we sold our interest in the operating affiliate in Venezuela for a cash purchase price of   $0.5   million.    

During the secon  d quarter of 2014,   all of the assets and liabiliti  es of the     Europe-based   Polym  er Additives business   were classified as held-for-sale.  As further discussed in   Note 3, in the third quarter of 2016,     w  e   completed the disposition of the Europe-based Polymer Additives business and   have classified the related operating results, net of income tax, as discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. 

Operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results expected in subsequent quarters or for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  .   

2.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  

In November 2015, the   Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )   issued   Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-17,   Income Taxes: Topic 740: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  .  ASU 2015-17 requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.  During the second quarter of 2016, we elected to prospectively adopt ASU 2015-17, thus reclassifying current deferred tax assets to noncurrent on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The prior reporting period was not retrospectively adjusted.  Other than this reclassification, the adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have an impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

New     Accounting Standards   

In August 2016, the FASB   issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flow: Topic 230: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    ASU 2016-15 is intended to address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.    The Company is in the process of assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB   issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation: Topic 718: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    ASU 2016-09 is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  This pronouncement is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted.    The Company is in the process of assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents    

In February 2016, the FASB   issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases: Topic 842.    ASU 2016-02 requires companies to recognize a lease liability and asset on the balance sheet for operating leases with a term greater than one year.  This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.    The Company is in the process of assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606  . This ASU replaces nearly all existing U.S. GAAP guidance on revenue recognition. The standard prescribes a five-step model for recognizing revenue, the application of which will require significant judgment. This standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is in the process of assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

No other new accounting pronouncements issued or with effective dates during fiscal 2016 had or are expected to have a material impact of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

3.    Discontinued Operations 

During the second quarter of 2014, we commenced a process to market for sale all of the assets within our   Europe-based Polymer Additives business,   including the Antwerp, Belgium dibenzoates manufacturing assets, and related Polymer Additives European headquarters and lab facilities.  We determined that the criteria to classify these assets as held-for-sale under ASC Topic 360, Property, Pl  ant and Equipment, were   met.  On August 22  , 2016, the Company completed the disposition of the Europe-based Polymer Additives business to Plahoma Two AG, an affiliate of the LIVIA Group.    The Company made a capital contribution     of    12   million (approximately   $13.6   million) to its subsidiaries that owned the assets prior to the close of the sale.    In August 2016, prior to the sale, an   impairment charge   of   $26.8   million     was recorded under ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant and Equipment  .    The   charge   was   calculated as the difference of the executed transaction price and the carrying value of the assets. The impairment charge included   $1.1   million associated with the reclassification of foreign currency translation   loss   from Accumulated other comprehensive loss (Note 17).        T  he Europe-based Polymer Additives     operating results, net of income tax,   are classified   as discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented   and the   assets and liabilities   are classified   as held-for-sale in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets   at December 31, 2015   as the criteria to do so under ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment were met as the respective periods  .   

The table below summarizes results for the Europe-based Polymer Additives assets, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , which are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations.  Interest expense has been allocated to the discontinued operations based on the ratio of net assets of each business to consolidated net assets excluding debt.

The acquired business contributed net sales of   $6.2   million and   $18.2   million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and net income attributable to Ferro Corporation of   $0.6   million and   $2.8   million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

The information included herein has been prepared based on the preliminary allocation of the purchase price using estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which were determined with the assistance of third parties who performed independent valuations using discounted cash flow and comparative market approaches and estimates made by management. As of September 30, 2016, the purchase price allocation is subject to further adjustment until all information is fully evaluated by the Company.

Nubiola 

On July 7, 2015, the Company acquired the entire share capital of Corporaci n Qu mica Vhem, S.L., Dibon USA, LLC and Ivory Corporation, S.A. (together with their direct and indirect subsidiaries,  Nubiola ) on a cash-free and debt-free basis for    167   million (approximately   $184.2   million).  The acquisition was funded with excess cash and borrowings under the Company s existing revolving credit facility.  See Note 8 for additional detail on the revolving credit facility. During the second qu  arter of 2016, the Company finalized     a    p  urchase price adjustment for   the settlement of an escrow that reduced the fair value of net assets acquired to $168.1 million.  As a result of the purchase price adjustment, the carrying amount of goodwill decreased by   $11.7   million,   amortizable intangible assets   decreased   $6.4   million and the related deferred tax liability decreased   $1.9   million. The impact of the change on the condensed consolidated statements of operations was not material.   

The information included herein has been prepared based on the allocation of the purchase price using estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which were determined with the assistance of third parties who performed independent valuations using discounted cash flow and comparative market approaches and estimates made by management.  

The following table summarizes the purchase price allocations: 

(1) 

Net working capital is defined as current assets, less cash, less current liabilities.     

The acquired business contributed net sales of   $33.0   million and   $97.2   million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   and net income attributable to Ferro Corporation of   $7.2   million and   $21.4   million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

The   fair value of the receivables acquired is   $24.5   million, with a gross contractual amount of   $25.2   million.  The Company recorded acquired intangible assets subject to amortization of   $21.1   million, which is comprised of   $5.4   million of customer relationships and   $15.7   million of technology/know-how, which will be amortized over   20   years and   15   years, respectively.  The Company recorded acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets of   $5.6   million related to trade names and trademarks.  Goodwill is

Table of Contents    

calculated as the excess of the p  urchase price over the   fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the acquisition and is a result of anticipated synergies.    Goodwill is not   deductible for tax purposes.   

The following unaudited pro for  ma information represents the consolidated results of the Company as if the Nubiola acquisitio  n occurred as of January 1, 2015  :   

The unaudited pro forma information has been adjusted with the respect to certain aspects of the acquisition to reflect the following:  

Additional depreciation and amortization expenses that would have been recognized assuming fair value adjustments to the existing Nubiola assets acquired, including intangible assets and fixed assets.     

Elimination of revenue and cost of goods sold for sales from Nubiola to the Company, which would be eliminated as intercompany transactions for Nubiola and the Company on a consolidated basis.     

Increased interest expense due to additional borrowings to fund the acquisition.     

Acquisition-related costs, which were included in the Company s results.     

Adjustments for the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments related to the acquisition.     

Thermark 

In February 2015, the Company acquired TherMark Holdings, Inc., a leader in laser marking technology, for a cash purchase price of   $5.5   million.  The Company recorded   $4.6   million of amortizable intangible assets,   $2.5   million of goodwill,   $1.7   million of a deferred tax liability related to the amortizable intangible assets, and   $0.1   million of net working capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

In the production of some of our products, we use precious metals, some of which we obtain from financial institutions under consignment agreements with terms of   one   year or less. The financial institutions retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amou  nts we consign. These fees were   $0.2   million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and were   $0.6   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We had on-  hand precious metals owned by participants in our precious metals consignment program of   $26.8     million at   September 30, 2016  , and   $20.5   million at   December 31, 2015  , measured at fair value based on market prices for identical assets and net of credits.  

6.    Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and equipment is reported net of accumulated depreciation of   $447.0   million at   September 30, 2016  , and   $421.3   million at   December 31, 2015  . Unpaid capital expenditure liabilities, which are non-cash investing activities, were   $2.4   million at   September 30, 2016  , and   $3.4   million at   September 30, 2015  .   

As discussed in Note 3 - Discontinued Operations, our Europe-based Polymer Additives assets have been classified as held-for-sale under ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment until the ultimate sale of the business in August 2016. As such, at each historical reporting date, these assets were tested for impairment comparing the fair value of the assets less costs to sell to the carrying value.  The fair value was determined using both the m  arket approach and income approach, utilizing Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy, which indicated the fair value less costs to sell was less than the carrying value during the first quarter of 2016, resulting in an impairment charge of   $24.1   million, representing the remaining carrying value of long-lived assets   at that reporting date  .  During the third quarter of 2016, prior to the sale, an impairment charge   of   $26.8   million  , representing net working capital,   was recorded under ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant and Equipment. The impairment charges of   $26.8 million and   $50.9   million   are included in Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.       

During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $11.8 million, which represented additional capital expenditures related to the construction of the facility.  The impairment charge of $11.8 million is included in Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The following table presents information about the Company's impairment charges on assets that were measured on a fair value basis for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  The table also indicates the   level within the   fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques used by the Company to determine the fair value:       

The inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are classified into the following categories: 

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

Credit Facility 

On July 31, 2014, the Company entered into   a credit facility (the    Credit Facility ) with a group of lenders to refinance the majority of its   then outstanding debt.  The Credit Facility consisted   of a   $200   million secured revolving line of credit with a term of   five   years and a   $300   million secured term loan facility with a term of   seven   years.   On January 25, 2016, the Company amended the Credit Facility by entering into the Incremental Assumption Agreement (the  Incremental Agreement ) to increase the revolving line of credit commitment amount from $200 million to   $300   million.  The Company then used a portion of the increase in the revolving line of credit to repay   $50   million of the term loan facility.   The Credit Facility was amended and a porti  on of the outstanding term loan was   repaid to increase the amount of total liquidity available under t  he Credit Facility and   reduce the total cost of borrowings.     On August 29, 2016, the Company amended the Credit Facility by entering into the Second Incremental Assumption Agreement (the  Second Incremental Agreement ) to increase the revolving line of credit commitment amount to   $400   million.   The increase in the revolving line of credit commitment will be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. 

Principal payments on the term loan facility of   $0.75   million quarterly  , are payable commencing   December 31, 2014  ,   with the remaining balance du  e on the maturity date.    At   September 30, 2016  ,    after   taking into account all prior quarterly payments and the $50 million prepayment that was made in January   2016,   the Company had borrowed   $244.0   million   under the term loan facility at an annual rate   of   4.0%  .

The   Credit Facility contains customary restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on use of loan proceeds, limitations on the Company s ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, limitations on acquisitions and dispositions and limitations on certain   types of investments.  The   Credit Facility also contains standard provisions relating to conditions of borrowing and customary events of default, including the non-payment of obligations by the Company and the bankruptcy of the Company. 

Specific to the revolving credit facility, the Company is subject to financial covenants regarding the Company s outstanding net indebtedness and interest coverage ratios. 

If an event of default occurs, all am  ounts outstanding under the   Credit Facility may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable.  At   September 30, 2016  , we were in complianc  e with the covenants of the   Credit Facility. 

Other Financing Arrangements 

We maintain other lines of credit to provide global flexibility for our short-term liquidity requirements. These facilities are uncommitted lines for our international operations and   totaled   $32.9   million and   $8.0   million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The unused portions of these lines provided additional liquidity of   $28.8   million at September 30, 2016, and   $7.3   million at December 31, 2015. 

9.    Financial Instruments 

The following financial instrument assets (liabilities) are presented at their respective carrying amount, fair value and classification within the fair value hierarchy: 

(1) The carrying value of the term loan facility is net of unamortized debt issuance costs.  

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents are based on the fair values of identical assets. The fair values of loans payable are based on the present value of expected future cash flows and approximate their carrying amounts due to the short periods to maturity.  The fair values of the term loan fac  ility, the revolving credit facility   and other long-term notes payable are based on the present value of expected future cash flows and interest rates that would be currently available to the Company for issuance of similar types of debt instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities adjusted for the Company's non-performance risk.

Foreign currency forward contracts.    We manage foreign currency risks principally by entering into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions. These forward contracts are not formally designated as hedges.   Gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are netted with gains and losses from currency fluctuations on transactions arising from international trade and reported as   Foreign currency losses, net in   the condensed consolidated statements of operations. We   recognized net foreign   currency losses   of   $0.9   million   and $  2.9    m  illion   in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and net foreign currency losses of   $1.2   million and   $5.8   million in the three and nine months ended Septe  mber 30, 2015, respectively, which is primarily comprised of the foreign exchange impact on transactions in countries where it is not economically feasible for us to enter into hedging arrangements and hedging inefficiencies, such as timing of transactions.   The net foreign currency loss of $5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, includes a loss on a foreign currency contract related to the Euro denominated purchase of Nubiola of   $2.7   million.   We     recognized net losses   of   $1.2   million and     $5.8   million     in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and net losses   of   $2.3   million and   $1.0   million   in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively,   arising from the change in fair value of our financial instruments, which offset the related net gains and losses on international trade transactions. The fair values of these contracts are based on market prices for comparable contracts.   The notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts was   $243.3   million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $338.4   million at   December 31, 2015  . 

The following table presents the effect on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three   and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, of our foreign currency forward contracts:

10.    Income Taxes 

Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $22.7 million, or   25.8%   of pre-tax income, compared with $11.9 million, or   22.6%   of pre-tax income in the prior-year same period.  The tax expense, as a percentage of pre-tax income, is lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of   35%   primarily as a result of foreign statutory rate differences.  Through the third quarter of 2015, tax expense was further lowered as a result of pre-tax losses in jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is recognized in proportion to the amount of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with no tax expense due to the utilization of fully valued tax

attributes.  Additionally, during the third quarter of 2015, the Company made a tax payment to a foreign tax jurisdiction for the ability to deduct specific intangible items in the future which resulted in the accounting for the net benefit in the period. 

11.    Contingent Liabilities 

We have recorded environmental liabilities of   $7.6    m  illion at   September 30, 2016  , and   $7.4   million at   December 31, 2015  , for costs associated with the remediation of certain of our properties that hav  e been contaminated. The liability   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , was primarily   related to a non-operating facility in Brazil, and for retained environmental obligations related to a site in the United States that was part of the sale of our North American and Asian metal powders product lines in 2013. The costs include legal and consulting fees, site studies, the design and implementation of remediation plans, post-remediation monitoring and related activities. The ultimate liability could be affected by numerous uncertainties, including the extent of contamination found, the required period of monitoring and the ultimate cost of required remediation.  

In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Supreme Court in Argentina ruled unfavorably related to certain export taxes associated with a divested operation.  As a result of this ruling, we have recorded a   liability of     $8.5     million   and   a    $7.8   million   at   September 30, 2016, and     December 31, 2015  , respectively  . 

There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. We do not currently expect the resolution of these lawsuits and claims to materially affect the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. 

12.    Retirement Benefits 

Net   periodic benefit (credit) cost   of our U.S. pension plans (including our unfunded nonqualified plans), non-U.S. pension plans, and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, follow:

Net periodic benefit credit   for our U.S. pension plans for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   de  creased   from   the prior year due to reduced plan assets as a result of executing our terminated-vested buyout program in the fourth quarter of 2015  . Net periodic benefit cost for our non-U.S. pension plans   and   our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans did not change significantly compared with the prior-year same period.

In 2015, the   Company initiated and executed on a buyout of terminated vested participants in our U.S defined benefit pension plan.  In October 2015, the buyout was funded and r  educed plan assets and liabilities   by approximately   $71 million  . 

13.    Stock-Based Compensation 

On May 22, 2013, our shareholders approved the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  Plan ), which was adopted by the Board of Directors on February 22, 2013, subject to shareholder approval. The Plan s purpose is to promote the Company s long-term financial interests and growth by attracting, retaining and motivating high quality key employees and directors, motivating such employees and directors to achieve the Company s short- and long-range p  erformance goals and objectives and thereby align    t  heir interests with those of the Company s   shareholders. The Plan reserves   4,400,000   shares of common stock to be issued for grants of several different types of long-term incentives including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restric  ted shares, performance shares,   other common stock based awards,   and dividend equivalent rights. 

In   the first nine months   of   2016  , our Board of Di  rec  tors granted   0.3   million stock options,   0.3   million performance share units and   0.3   million deferred stock units under the Plan.       

We estimate the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table details the weighted-average grant-date fair values and the assumptions used for estimating the fair values of stock option grants made during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

The weighted average grant date fair value of our performance share units   granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2016,   was   $10.02  .   We measure the fair value of performance share units based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the grant. These shares are evaluated each reporting period for likelihood of achieving the performance criteria. 

We measure the fair value of deferred stock units based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the grant  , which is when the   awards immediately vest. The weighted-average   grant date   fair value per unit for grants made during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was   $10.46  . 

We recognized stock-based compensation expense of   $5.3   million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   and   $7.4   million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , unearned compensation cost related to the unvested portion of all stock-based   compensation   awards was approximately   $9.3   million and is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of the respective grants  , through the first quarter of 2019.

14.    Restructuring and Cost Reduction Programs 

In 2013, we initiated a Global Cost Reduction Progra  m that was designed to address three   key areas of the company - (1) business realignment, (2) operational efficiency and (3) corporate and back office functions.  Business realignment was targeted at right-sizing our commercial management organizations globally.  The operational efficiency component of the program was designed to improve the efficiency of our plant operations and supply chain.  The corporate and back office initiative   relates to   work that we are doing with our strategic partners in the areas of finance and accounting  ,   information technology outsourcing, and procurement. The cumulative charges incurred   to date associated with this Program   are   $51.3   million. Total costs related to the Program expected to be incurred, as of September 30, 2016, are approximately   $51.3   million.   Total restructuring charges were   approximately     $0.0   million and   $1.7   million for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $3.8   million and   $5.3   million for the three and nine months ended September   30, 2015, respectively.  

The activities and accruals related to our restructuring   and cost reduction programs   are summarized below: 

We expect to make cash payments to settle the remaining liability for employee termination benefits and other costs   over the next twelve months  , except where legal or contractual restrictions prevent us from doing so.

15.    Earnings Per Share 

Details of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share are shown below: 

The number of anti-dilutive or unearned shares was   2.3   million   and   2.5   million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   respectively,   and   2.3   million for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  These shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive impact. 

16.    Share Repurchase Program    

On July 25, 2016, the   Company s Board of Directors approved a   new   share repurchase pro  gram, under which the Company is   authorized to repurchase up to   an additional     $25   million of the Company s outstanding shares of Common Stock on the open market, including through a Rule 10b5-1 plan, or in privately negotiated transactions.    This new program is in addition to the   $75   million of authorization previously approved and announced  . 

The timing and amount of shares to be repurchased will be determined by the Company, based on evaluation of market and business conditions, share price, and other factors.  The share repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of common shares, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company   repurchased   1,175,  437   shares of common stock at an average price of   $9.  72   per share for a total cost of $11.4   million.  Under the   share repurchase programs, the Company   has   repurchased   an aggregate of     4,458,345   shares of common stock, at an average price of   $11.  21   per share, for a total cost of   $50.0   million.  As of September 30, 2016,   $50.0   million may still be purchased under the programs.

On October 31, 2016, the Company   acquired   100%   of     the membership interests of Electro-Science Laboratories ( ESL ),   a leader in electronic packaging materials for   $75   million, excluding customary adjustments and fees.  ESL is headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.    The acquisition of ESL enhances the Company s position in the electronic packaging materials space with complementary products,   and offers a platform for growth in Ferro s Performance Colors and Glass segment.   ESL produces thick-film pastes and ceramic tape systems that enable important functionality in a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications. 

The operating results related to the ESL acquisition will be included in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements commencing October 31, 2016, the date of the acquisition.   

Due to the timing of the acquisition, the Company s initial purchase price accounting was incomplete at the time these financial statements were issued.  As such, the Company cannot disclose the allocation of the acquisition price to acquired assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at this time.

Item 2.      Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 

Net sales for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , increased by     $9.2   million, or   3.3  %, compared with the prior-year same peri  od.        The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the sales from   Al Salomi, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015, the increase in sales in surface technology products, and the sales from Pinturas, which was acquired in the second quarter of 2016, of $6.2   million  , $2.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively.  This increase was partially offset by $1.8 million due to the   sale of   our interest in an operating affiliate in   Venezuela   ( Venezuela )   in the fourth quarter   of 2015  .        During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , gross profit increased   $12.0   million, or   15.5%  , compared with the prior-year same period; and, as a percentage of net sales, it increased approximately   320   basis points to   30.8%  .    The increase     in gross profit   was   attributable to   an increase in   Pigments, Powders and Oxides, Performance Coatings, and Performance Colors and Glass of $10.0 million, $1.5 million and $0.6   million, respectively.       

For the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses increased $  7.2   million, or   14.8  %, compared with the prior-year same period.    The increase was   primarily driven   by higher expenses   in stock-based compensation of $2.0 million and incentive compensation of $1.2 million as a result of the Company s performance relative to targets for certain awards compared with the prior-year same period   and an   increase in pension and other postretirement benefits of $1.6 million which is a result of the     effect of a   lower expected return on plan assets in the current year as a result of executing our terminated-vested buyout program in the fourth quarter of 2015  . 

For the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , net loss was $  8.7   million, compared with net loss of $  3.6   million for the prior-year same period, and net loss attributable to common shareholders was   $8.9   million, compared with net loss attributable to common shareholders of   $4.1   million for the prior-year same period.   Income from   continuing operations was   $20.5   million for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with income from continuing operations of   $15.5   million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Our t  otal gross profit for the third   quarter of   2016   was   $89.0   million, compared with   $77.0   million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

2016 Transactional Activity 

Disposition of the Europe-based Polymer Additives business 

As discussed in Note 3  ,   in the third quarter of 2016,   the Company completed the disposition of the Europe-based Polymer Additives business to Plahoma Two AG, an affiliate of the LIVIA Group.   

Business Acquisitions 

Acquisition   of Delta Performance   Products:   As di  scussed in Note 4, in the third   quarter of   2016, the Company     acquired   certain   assets of Delta Performance Products, LLC  , for a cash purchase price of   $4.4   million. 

Acquisition of   Pinturas  :    As discussed in Note 4, in the second quarter of 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the equity of privately held Pinturas Benicarl , S.L. ( Pinturas   ) for  16.5   mill  ion in cash (approximately $18.4   million). 

Acquisition of   Ferer  :    As discussed in Note 4, in the first quarter of 2016, the Company completed the purchase of   100%   of the equity of privately held Istanbul-based Ferer Dis Ticaret Ve Kimyasallar Anonim Sirketi A.S. ( Ferer ) on a cash-free and debt-free basis for approximately   $9.  4   million in cash. 

Outlook 

The Company delivered strong performance in the third quarter   of 2016.  Sales increased 3.3% primarily due to acquisitions acquired within the last year.  In   addition, gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 30.8% from 27.6%.  Partially offsetting the higher gross profit were increased SG A c  osts, primarily driven by an   increase in stock-based compensation   expense, incentive compensation   expense and a reduction in p  ension and postretirement benefits income. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 25.8%, compared with 22.6% in the third quarter of 2015.  We continue to expect the full year 2016 tax rate to be in the range of 27% - 28%. 

25   

Table of Contents    

For the remainder of 2016, we anticipate benefitting from strategic actions taken to improve growth in our core businesses and will continue to benefit from recent acquisitions.  We expect Pigments, Powders and Oxides to provide growth   through the remainder of 2016  .      The net impact is expected to result in increased sales growth over the remainder of the year, before consideration of foreign currency impacts.       

We remain focused on the integration of our recent acquisitions and continue to work toward achieving the identified synergies.  We will continue to focus on opportunities to optimize our cost structure and make our business processes and systems more efficient, and to leverage tax planning opportunities.  We continue to expect cash flow from operating activities to be positive for the year, providing additional liquidity. 

Factors that could adversely affect our future performance include those described under the heading  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The increase     in gross profit   was   attributable to   an increase in   Pigments, Powders   and Oxides, Performance Coatings, and Performance Colors and Glass of $10.0 million, $1.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively.  The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher sales volumes and mix   of $7.7   million, lower raw material costs of $6.1 million and lower manufacturing costs of $3.8 million, partially offset by unfavorable product pricing of $3.8 million and unfavorable   foreign currency impacts of $1.6   million.       

Geographic Revenues 

The following table presents our sales on the basis of where sales originated. 

The   increase   in net sales   of   $9.2   million  , compared with the prior-year same period,   was driven by an increase in sales in Asia Pacific, Europe and the United States,   partially offset by   a sales decrease in   Latin America.     The increase in sal  es in Asia Pacific was   attributable to increased sales across all   segments. The increase in   sales in   Europe was primarily attributable to sales from acquisitions

acquired within the last year of $9.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in sales in Performance Coatings excluding   sales from   Al Salomi.    The increase in sales in the United States was attributable to higher sales in Pigments  ,   Powders and Oxides of $5.4 million, partially offset by lower sales in Performance Colors and Glass of $2.5 million. The decrease in sales in Latin America was primarily attributable to   the   sale of our interest in an operating affi  liate in Venezuela   in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

The following table includes significant components of SG A and their respective changes between 2016   and   2015  : 

SG A   expen  ses   were   $7.2   million   higher   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,    compared with the prior-year same period.    Included in SG A expenses were   $  1.1 million of expenses related to acquisitions acquired within the last year.  The increase in stock-based compensation expense of $2.0 million and incentive compensation expense of $1.2 million is a result of the Company s performance relative to targets for certain awards compared with the prior-year same period. The increase in pension and other postretirement benefits of   $1.6   million is a result of the     effect of a     lower expected return on plan assets in the current year as a result of executing our terminated-vested buyout program in the fourth quarter of 2015.    

The following table presents SG A expenses attributable to sales, research and development and operations costs as strategic services and other SG A costs as functional services.

Table of Contents    

SG A expenses were $7.2 million higher in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the prior-year same period.    The increase   in SG A expenses was driven by higher expenses   in strategic services from   acquisitions acquired within the last year   of $0.9 million and the increase in bad debt expense o  f $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   compared with the prior-year same period. In addition, the   functional services   expense increase   was driven by an increase in expense from acquis  itions acquired within the last year of $0.2 million and the increase in pension and other postretirement benefits of $1.6 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   compared with the prior-year same period  .    

Restructuring and Impairment   Charges 

Restructuring   and impairment charges     decreased   in   the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with the prior-year same period.     The decrease was primarily due to early termination costs of a contract associated with restructuring a corporate function of $2.8 million during the third quarter of 2015 and lower costs associated with employee severance for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the prior-year same period.  

Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased the third quarter of 2016   compared with the   prior-year same period  . The increase in interest expense   was due to an   increase in the average long-term debt balance during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the prior-year same period, as well as less interest capitalization associated with long-term capital projects. 

Income Tax Expense 

During the third quarter of 2016, income tax expense was $6.2 million, or 23.1% of pre-tax income.  In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded tax expense of $3.8 million, or 19.6% of pre-tax income.  The tax expense in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, as a percentage of pre-tax income, is lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of foreign statutory rate differences.  The third quarter 2015 tax expense was further lowered as a result of pre-tax losses in jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized in proportion to the amount of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with no tax expense due to the utilization of fully

valued tax attributes.  Additionally, during the third quarter of 2015, the Company made a tax payment to a foreign tax jurisdiction for the ability to deduct specific intangible items in the future which resulted in a net benefit in the period.

The following table presents SG A expenses attributable to sales, research and development and operations costs as strategic services and other SG A costs as functional services. 

SG A expenses were $15.5 million higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the prior-year same period.    The increase in   SG A expenses was driven by higher expenses in   strategic   services   from   acquisitions acquired within the last year of $6.1 million and an   in  crease in bad debt expense of $1.1   million   for the first nine months   of 2016  ,   compared with the prior-year same period  .    In addition, the   functional services   expenses     increase   was driven by the increase   in pension and other postretirement benefits of $5.1 million   the first nine months   of 2016  ,   compared with the prior-year same period  . 

Restructuring and Impairment Charges 

Restructuring and impairment charges   decreased by $3.8 million   in   the first nine months   of 2016 compared with the prior-year same period.

Table of Contents    

Interest expense increased in the first nine months of 2016   due to an   increase in the average long-term debt balance for the 2016 period, compared with the prior-year same period, as well as less interest capitalization associated with long-term capital projects which was driven by lower spend   for th  e Antwerp, Belgium facility, which was   substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2015  . 

Income Tax Expense 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income tax expense was $22.7 million, or 25.8% of pre-tax income, compared with $11.9 million, or 22.6% of pre-tax income in the prior-year same period.  The tax expense, as a percentage of pre-tax income, is lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily as a result of foreign statutory rate differences.  Through the third quarter of 2015, tax expense was further lowered as a result of pre-tax losses in jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is recognized in proportion to the amount of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with no tax expense due to the utilization of fully valued tax attributes.  Additionally, during the third quarter of 2015, the Company made a tax payment to a foreign tax jurisdiction for the ability to deduct specific intangible items in the future which resulted in the accounting for the net benefit in the period.

Cash flows from financing activities.     Cash flows provided by fin  ancing activities decreased $105.6 million in the first nine   months of 2016 compared with the prior-year same period  , driven by the   $50  .0   million prepayment   on the term loan facility   that was made in January   2016  , a net borrowing decrease on the revolving credit facility of $52.8 million, and the additional purchase of treasury stock of $4.4 million.   

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

Credit Facility 

On July 31, 2014, the Company entered into   a credit facility (the    Credit Facility ) with a group of lenders to refinance the majority of its   then outstanding debt.  The Credit Facility consisted   of a   $200   million secured revolving line of credit with a term of   five   years and a   $300   million secured term loan facility with a term of   seven   years.   On January 25, 2016, the Company amended the Credit Facility by entering into the Incremental Assumption Agreement (the  Incremental Agreement ) to increase the revolving line of credit commitment amount from $200 million to   $300   million.  The Company then used a portion of the increase in the revolving line of credit to repay   $50   million of the term loan facility.   The Credit Facility was amended and a porti  on of the outstanding term loan was   repaid to increase the amount of total liquidity available under t  he Credit Facility and   reduce the total cost of borrowings.     On August 29, 2016, the Company amended the Credit Facility by entering into the Second Incremental Assumption Agreement (the  Second Incremental Agreement ) to increase the revolving line of credit commitment amount to $400 million.   The increase in the revolving line of credit commitment will be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. 

Principal payments on the term loan facility of   $0.75   million quarterly  , are payable commencing   December 31, 2014  ,   with the remaining balance du  e on the maturity date.   At   September 30  , 2016  , the Company had   borrowed $244.0 million   under the term loan facility  ,    taking into account all prior quarterly payments and the $50 million prepayment that was made in January   2016,   at an annual rate   of   4.0%  .  There   are     no   additional borrowings available   under the term loan facility.

The   Credit Facility contains customary restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on use of loan proceeds, limitations on the Company s ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, limitations on acquisitions and dispositions and limitations on certain   types of investments.  The   Credit Facility also contains standard provisions relating to conditions of borrowing and customary events of default, including the non-payment of obligations by the Company and the bankruptcy of the Company. 

Specific to the revolving credit facility, the Company is subject to financial covenants regarding the Company s outstanding net indebtedness and interest coverage ratios. 

If an event of default occurs, all am  ounts outstanding under the   Credit Facility may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable.  At   September 30, 2016  , we were in complianc  e with the covenants of the   Credit Facility.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Consignment and Customer Arrangements for Precious Metals.    We use precious metals, primarily silver, in the production of some of our products. We obtain most precious metals from financial institutions under consignment agreements (generally referred to as our precious metals consignment program). The financial institutions retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amounts we consign and the period of consignment. These   fees were   $0.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and were $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   We had on hand precious metals owned by participants in our precious metals program of   $26.8   million at   September 30, 2016  , and   $20.5   million at   December 31, 2015  , measured at fair value based on market prices for identical assets and net of credits.  

The consignment agreements under our precious metals program involve short-term commitments that typically mature within 30 to 90 days of each transaction and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis. As a result, the Company relies on the continued willingness of financial institutions to participate in these arrangements to maintain this source of liquidity. On occasion, we have been required to deliver cash collateral. While no deposits were outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , or   December 31, 2015  ,    we may be required to furnish cash collateral in the future based on the quantity and market value of the precious metals under consignment and the amount of collateral-free lines provided by the financial institutions. The amount of cash collateral required is subject to review by the financial institutions and can be changed at any time at their discretion, based in part on their assessment of our creditworthiness. 

Bank Guarantees and Standby Letters of Credit.    

At   September 30,   2016, the Company and its subsidiaries had bank guarantees and standby letters of credit issued by financial institutions that totaled   $6.3   million. These agreements primarily relate to Ferro s insurance programs, foreign energy purchase contracts and foreign tax payments. 

Other Financing Arrangements 

We maintain other lines of credit to provide global flexibility for Ferro s short-term liquidity requirements. These facilities are uncommitted lines for our international operations and   totaled   $32.9   million and $8.0 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We had   $28.8   million and $7.3 million   of additional borrowings available under these lines at   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Liquidity Requirements 

Our primary sources of liquidity are available cash and cash equivalents, available lines of credit under the revolving credit facility, and cash flows from operating activities. As of September 30, 2016 we had $40.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. Substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash generated in the U.S. is generally used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.  If needed, we could repatriate the majority of cash held by foreign subsidiaries without the need to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes. We do not anticipate a liquidity need requiring such repatriation of these funds to the U.S.  

Our liquidity requirements primarily include debt service, purchase commitments, labor costs, working capital requirements, restructuring expenditures, capital investments, precious metals cash collateral requirements, and postretirement obligations. We expect to meet these requirements in the long term through cash provided by operating activities and availability under existing credit facilities or other financing arrangements. Cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by earnings before non-cash charges and changes in working capital needs. We had additional borrowing capacity of   $191.3   million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $32.9   million at   December 31, 2015  , available under our   various credit facilities, primarily our revolving credit facility.    

Our revolving credit facility subjects us to customary financial covenants, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. These covenants under our credit facility restrict the amount of our borrowings, reducing our flexibility to fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives. 

The most critical of these ratios is the leverage ratio for the revolving credit facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio covenant of 3.75x as our actual   ratio was 2.58x, providing $59.3   million of EBITDA cushion on the leverage ratio, as defined within the Credit Facility. To the extent that economic conditions in key markets deteriorate or we are unable to meet our business projections and EBITDA falls below approximately $130 million   for rolling four quarters, based on reasonably consistent debt levels with those as of   December 31, 2015  , we could become unable to maintain compliance with our  

40   

Table of Contents    

leverage ratio covenant. In such case, our lenders could demand immediate payment of outstanding amounts and we would need to seek alternate financing sources to pay off such debts and to fund our ongoing operations. Such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.       

Difficulties experienced in global capital markets could affect the ability or willingness of counterparties to perform under our various lines of credit, forward contracts, and precious metals program. These counterparties are major, reputable, multinational institutions, all having investment-grade credit ratings, except for one, which is not rated. Accordingly, we do not anticipate counterparty default. However, an interruption in access to external financing could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition. 

We assess on an ongoing basis our portfolio of businesses, as well as our financial and capital structure, to ensure that we have sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our strategic objectives. As part of this process, from time to time we evaluate the possible divestiture of businesses that are not critical to our core strategic objectives and, where appropriate, pursue the sale o  f such businesses and assets  . We also evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our strategic position. Generally, we publicly announce divestiture and acquisition transactions only when we have   closed on   those transactions.

Risk Factors 

Certain statements contained here and in future filings with the SEC reflect the Company s expectations with respect to future performance and constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are subject to a variety of uncertainties, unknown risks and other factors concerning the Company s operations and business environment, which are difficult to predict and are beyond the control of the Company.

Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to instruments that are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and costs of raw materials and energy. 

Our exposure to interest rate risk arises from our debt portfolio. We manage this risk by controlling the mix of fixed versus variable-rate debt after considering the interest rate environment and expected future cash flows. Our objective is to limit variability in earnings, cash flows and overall borrowing costs caused by changes in interest rates, while preserving operating flexibility. 

We operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions expose us to gains and losses arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled. We manage this risk by entering into forward currency contracts that substantially offset these gains and losses. 

The notional amounts, carrying amounts of assets (liabilities), and fair values associated with our exposure to these market risks and sensitivity analysis about potential gains (losses) resulting from hypothetical changes in market rates are presented below:

Item 4.      Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Ferro is committed to maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, Ferro has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The evaluation examined those disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  .

Dear Jeff:   

This letter agreement is intended to clarify the terms and conditions of your employment with Ferro Corporation (the    Company   ).  Effective as of September 1, 2016, you and the Company hereby agree to the following terms and conditions: 

1.      Employment  .  The Company shall continue to employ you, and you agree to continue your     employment with the Company until December 31, 2016 (the    Separation Date   ), pursuant to the terms of this letter agreement;   provided  ,    however  , that, effective September 1, 2016, you agree that you have resigned as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and from any other officer or director positions you held with the Company or any subsidiary as of September 1, 2016, and that you will provide services at a reduced level.  Until the Separation Date, you will be required to provide such services, as determined by the Company, for at least ten hours per week, at times and places to be mutually determined between you and the Company.  You agree that your employment with the Company will be terminated, and you will incur a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, on the Separation Date.  In addition, you agree to waive your change in duties and status resulting from the termination of your role as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and any other officer or director role as a  Good Reason  trigger under the Company s Executive Separation Policy, adopted June 23, 2010 (the    Separation Policy   ).  You also agree that if you become employed by a company or organization other than the Company prior to January 1, 2017, such event will be considered a voluntary termination of employment by you without good reason in violation of this letter agreement and (i) you will immediately cease to receive or have any rights to the payments and benefits described in this letter agreement, (ii) you will immediately cease to be eligible to execute and receive benefits under the Release Agreement (as such term is defined in Section 4 below) and (iii) you will not otherwise be eligible for benefits under the Separation Policy or the Change in Control Agreement between you and the Company, dated May 2, 2012 (the    Change in Control Agreement   ). 

2.      Compensation and Benefits  .  Through the Separation Date, the Company will continue to pay you your current base salary in installments, based on the Company s practices as may be in effect from time to time, at the rate of $488,900 per annum.  In addition, through the Separation Date, you will continue to be entitled to participate, on the same basis as other similarly situated employees of the Company, in those benefit programs (including insurance, vacation and other benefits), for which substantially all of the employees of the Company are from time to time generally eligible, as determined from time to time by the Company.  Further, any outstanding equity awards shall continue to be in effect in accordance with their terms, and you will continue to be entitled to an annual incentive award pursuant to the terms of the Separation Policy and the Release Agreement (as such term is defined in Section 4 below). 

3.      Duties  .  You agree that through the Separation Date, you will fully cooperate with the Company in effecting an orderly transition of your duties and in ensuring that the business of the Company is conducted in a professional, positive and competent manner.   

4.      Severance  .  If after the Separation Date, but prior to the 30  th   day following the Separation Date, you timely execute (and do not revoke) the separation and release agreement (the    Release Agreement   ), attached hereto as   Exhibit A  , which includes a release of all claims arising on or before the date of the Release Agreement, known or unknown, against the Company and its affiliates, then the Company will provide the benefits and payments described in such Release Agreement, which are the benefits to which you are entitled under the Separation Policy.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change in Control or Potential Change in Control (as such terms are defined in the Change in Control Agreement) occurring between the date of this letter agreement and the Separation Date, the terms of the Release Agreement may be revised to reflect the benefits provided under the Change in Control Agreement to the extent applicable, instead of the benefits provided under the Separation Policy. 

5.      Complete Agreement  .  This letter agreement embodies the complete agreement and understanding between the Company and you with respect to the subject matter hereof, and effective as of the date hereof, supersedes and preempts any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or between the Company and you, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.  This letter agreement will be binding immediately upon its execution. 

If you are in agreement with the terms of this letter agreement, please sign and date in the space provided below and return a signed copy to me.

A.      SEVERANCE PAYMENTS 

Ferro will pay Mr. Rutherford the following: 

(1)      A severance payment totaling Seven Hundred Thirty-Three Thousand Three Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($733,350), which is equivalent to eighteen (18) months of Mr. Rutherford s current base salary;  

(2)      A payment of Four Hundred Seventy-Six Thousand Six Hundred and Seventy-Eight Dollars ($476,678), which is equivalent to one and one-half (1.5) times the annual incentive that Mr. Rutherford would have earned under Ferro s annual incentive plan for 2016, assuming that performance had been attained at the  target  level as based on a percentage of Mr. Rutherford s current base salary; 

(3)      A payment equal to the annual incentive (if any) that Mr. Rutherford would have earned under Ferro s annual incentive plan for 2016 if he was employed by  

5   

Ferro as the Chief Financial Officer of Ferro on the last day of 2016, based on the actual level of performance attained for 2016.
