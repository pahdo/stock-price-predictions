INSULET CORPORATION 
  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 
   
  Note 1. Nature of the Business 
  Insulet Corporation, the "Company," is primarily engaged in the development, manufacturing and sale of its proprietary Omnipod Insulin Management System (the  Omnipod System ), an innovative, discreet and easy-to-use insulin infusion system for people with insulin-dependent diabetes.  The Omnipod System features a small, lightweight, self-adhesive disposable tubeless Omnipod device which is worn on the body for approximately three days at a time and its wireless companion, the handheld Personal Diabetes Manager ("PDM").  Conventional insulin pumps require people with insulin-dependent diabetes to learn to use, manage and wear a number of cumbersome components, including up to   42   inches of tubing.  In contrast, the Omnipod System features only two discreet, easy-to-use devices that eliminate the need for a bulky pump, tubing and separate blood glucose meter, provides for virtually pain-free automated cannula insertion, communicates wirelessly and integrates a blood glucose meter.  
  The Company acquired Neighborhood Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively,  Neighborhood Diabetes ) in   June 2011  .  Through Neighborhood Diabetes, the Company provided customers with blood glucose testing supplies, traditional insulin pumps, pump supplies and pharmaceuticals and had the ability to process claims as either durable medical equipment or through pharmacy benefits.  In February 2016, the Company sold Neighborhood Diabetes to Liberty Medical LLC ("Liberty Medical").  Additional information regarding the disposition and treatment of the Neighborhood Diabetes business as discontinued operations is provided in Note   3   to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
  Commercial sales of the Omnipod System began in the United States in   2005  .  The Company sells the Omnipod System and other diabetes management supplies in the United States through direct sales to customers or through its distribution partners.  The Omnipod System is currently available in multiple countries in Europe, Canada and Israel. 
  In addition to using the Pod for insulin delivery, the Company also partners with global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to tailor the Omnipod technology platform for the delivery of subcutaneous drugs across multiple therapeutic areas.     
  In July 2015, the Company executed an asset purchase agreement whereby it acquired the Canadian Omnipod distribution operations from GlaxoSmithKline ("GSK").  With the acquisition, the Company assumed all distribution, sales, marketing, training and support activities for the Omnipod system in Canada. 
   
  Note   2  . Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP  or "GAAP") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  , or for any other subsequent interim period. 
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and the Company's audited consolidated financial statements, as recast to reflect Neighborhood Diabetes as discontinued operations, contained in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 6, 2016. 
  Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain of its significant accounting policies that may materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.  The most significant estimates used in these financial statements include the valuation of stock-based compensation expense, acquired businesses, accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, deferred revenue, equity instruments, convertible debt, the lives of property and equipment and  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

intangible assets, as well as warranty and doubtful accounts allowance reserve calculations.  Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
  Foreign Currency Translation 
  For foreign operations, asset and liability accounts are translated at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date; income and expenses are translated using weighted average exchange rates for the reporting period.  Resulting translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses arising from transactions and translation of period-end balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, primarily the Canadian dollar, are included in other income, net, and were not material in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  For the purpose of the financial statement classification, the Company considers all highly-liquid investment instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents include money market mutual funds, corporate bonds, and certificates of deposit which are carried at their fair value.  Outstanding letters of credit, related to security deposits for lease obligations, totaled   $1.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  Investments 
  Investment securities consist of available-for-sale marketable securities and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses included as a component of other comprehensive loss in shareholders' equity.  Investments, exclusive of cash equivalents, with a stated maturity date of one year or less from the balance sheet date or that are expected to be used in current operations, are classified as short-term investments.  Short-term investments include U.S. government and agency bonds, corporate bonds, and certificates of deposit. 
  The Company reviews investments for other-than-temporary impairment when the fair value of an investment is less than its amortized cost. If an available-for-sale security is other than temporarily impaired, the loss is charged to either earnings or shareholders' equity depending on the Company's intent and ability to retain the security until the full cost basis can be recovered. 
  Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the respective assets.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over their useful life or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter.  Assets acquired under capital leases are amortized in accordance with the respective class of owned assets and the amortization is included with depreciation expense.  Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.  
  Property and equipment included   $38.3 million   and   $28.2 million   of accumulated depreciation as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   
  Goodwill 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired.  The Company follows the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 350-20,   Intangibles - Goodwill and Other   ( ASC 350-20 ).  The Company performs an assessment of its goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there might be impairment. The Company's annual impairment test date is October 1st. 
  As the Company operates in   one   segment, the Company has considered whether that segment contains multiple reporting units. The Company has concluded that there is a single reporting unit as the Company does not have segment managers and discrete financial information below consolidated results is not reviewed on a regular basis.  Based on this conclusion, goodwill is tested for impairment at the enterprise level. The Company has the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its sole reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. This qualitative analysis is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment analysis.  If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step goodwill impairment test will be performed.  The first step compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis.  If the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, the Company would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

exceeds its implied fair value.  There was   no   impairment of goodwill during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  Revenue Recognition 
  The Company generates most of its revenue from global sales of the Omnipod System.  Revenue also includes sales of devices based on the Omnipod technology platform to global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the delivery of subcutaneous drugs across multiple therapeutic areas. 
  Revenue recognition requires that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, delivery of goods occurs through transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  With respect to these criteria: 
             
    The evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a physician order form, a patient information form and, if applicable, third-party insurance approval for sales directly to patients or a purchase order for sales to a third-party distributor. 
                
    Transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership are passed to the patient or third-party distributor upon shipment of the products. 
                
    The selling prices for all sales are fixed and agreed with the patient or third-party distributor and, if applicable, the patient s third-party insurance provider(s) prior to shipment and are based on established list prices or, in the case of certain third-party insurers, contractually agreed upon prices.  Provisions for discounts, rebates and other adjustments to customers are established as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded. 
     The Company offers a   45  -day right of return for sales of its Omnipod System to patients in the United States, and a   90  -day right of return for sales of its Omnipod System to patients in Canada, and defers revenue to reflect estimated sales returns in the same period that the related product sales are recorded.  Returns are estimated through a comparison of the Company s historical return data to its related sales.  Historical rates of return are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace.  When doubt exists about reasonable assuredness of collectability from specific customers, the Company defers revenue from sales of products to those customers until payment is received. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had deferred revenue of   $1.8 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively, which included   $0.5 million   and   $0.2 million   classified in other long-term liabilities in each period as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Deferred revenue primarily relates to undelivered elements within certain of the Company's developmental arrangements and other instances where the Company has not yet met the revenue recognition criteria.  
  Shipping and Handling Costs 
  The Company does not typically charge its customers for shipping and handling costs associated with shipping its product to its customers.  These shipping and handling costs are included in general and administrative expenses and were   $1.1 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively and were   $2.8 million   and   $1.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and accounts receivable.  The Company maintains the majority of its cash and short term investments with   one   financial institution. 
  The Company purchases Omnipods from Flextronics International Ltd., its single source supplier.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , liabilities to this vendor represented approximately   29%   and   28%   of the combined balance of accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, respectively.  
  Revenue for customers comprising more than 10% of total revenue were as follows:

Reclassification of Prior Period Balance 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods amounts to conform to the current period financial statement presentation including adjusting footnotes within to reflect the presentation of discontinued operations.  These reclassifications have no effect on the previously reported net loss. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2014-09").  ASU 2014-09 requires that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  Under this guidance, a company makes additional estimates regarding performance conditions and the allocation of variable consideration.  The guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09.  The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.  
  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Accounting for Share-Based Payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period   ("ASU 2014-12").  ASU 2014-12 clarifies the period over which compensation cost would be recognized in awards with a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period.  Compensation cost would be recognized over the required service period, if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved.  The guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company has adopted ASU 2014-12 on January 1, 2016 and its adoption did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements- Going Concern ("ASU 2014-15").   ASU No. 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company has concluded that if this standard had been adopted as of   September 30, 2016  , substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern would not exist. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   ("ASU 2015-11").  ASU 2015-11 amends existing guidance and requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The guidance is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  Upon adoption, entities must disclose the nature of and reason for the accounting change.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-11. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations,     Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments   ("ASU 2015-16").  ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively.  Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The guidance is effective in 2016 for calendar year-end public entities.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has adopted ASU 2015-16 on January 1, 2016 and its adoption did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01 ("ASU 2016-01"),   Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . ASU 2016-01 changes the current GAAP model for the accounting of equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. All equity investments in unconsolidated entities (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) will generally be measured at fair value through earnings. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification (changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income (loss)) for equity securities with readily determinable fair values. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The classification and measurement guidance will be effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-01. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   ("ASU 2016-02").  ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities on their balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by most leases and continue to recognize expenses on their income statements over the lease term.  It will also require disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09").  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-09. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)   ("ASU 2016-15") .  ASU 2016-15 clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The guidance also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15.

  In February 2016, the Company sold Neighborhood Diabetes to Liberty Medical for approximately   $6.2 million   in cash, which included   $1.2 million   of closing adjustments finalized in June 2016 and paid by Liberty Medical.  The results of operations, assets, and liabilities of Neighborhood Diabetes, are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented, except for certain corporate overhead costs which remain in continuing operations.  
   In connection with the 2016 disposition, the Company entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which Insulet is providing various services to Liberty Medical on an interim transitional basis.  The services generally commenced on the closing date and terminated   six months   following the closing.  Services provided by Insulet included certain information technology and back office support.  The charges for such services were generally intended to allow the service provider to recover all out-of-pocket costs.  Billings by Insulet under the transition services agreement were recorded as a reduction of the costs to provide the respective service in the applicable expense category in the consolidated statements of operations.  This transitional support is to provide Liberty Medical the time required to establish its stand-alone processes for such activities that were previously provided by Insulet as described above and does not constitute significant continuing support of Liberty Medical's operations.  Total expenses incurred for such transition services, which were reimbursed in full, were   $0.1 million   and   $0.8 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Following the disposition, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with the Neighborhood Diabetes subsidiary of Liberty Medical to continue to act as a distributor for the Company's products.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , revenue from continued operations as presented in the consolidated statement of operations include   $0 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively. Omnipod sales transacted through Neighborhood Diabetes prior to the divestiture that were previously eliminated in consolidation were   $0.3 million   and   $2.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  These amounts were historically reported in the Neighborhood Diabetes revenue results and are being presented based on current market terms of products sold to the Neighborhood Diabetes subsidiary of Liberty Medical.  
  Post divestiture, Omnipod sales to the Neighborhood Diabetes subsidiary of Liberty Medical were   $0 million   and   $0.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
  The following is a summary of the operating results of Neighborhood Diabetes included in discontinued operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

  Note   4  . Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company adopted the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC 820 ) related to the fair value measurement of certain of its assets and liabilities.  ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions.  When estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, the Company may use one or all of the following approaches:  
             
    Market approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. 
                
    Cost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence. 
                
    Income approach, which is based on the present value of the future stream of net cash flows. 
     To measure fair value, the Company uses the following fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, as described in ASC 820, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable:  
  Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
  Level 2   observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
  Level 3   unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
  Certain of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.

    Long-term assets of discontinued operations relate to the asset group of the Neighborhood Diabetes business which consists of definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recognized an impairment charge on this asset group totaling   $9.1 million  , which represented the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying value. As a result of the impairment, the asset group was recorded at fair value as of December 31, 2015.  The fair value for the asset group was determined using the direct cash flows expected to be received from the disposition of the asset group, which was completed in February 2016 (level 3 input).     
     Debt 
  The estimated fair value of debt is based on the Level 2 quoted market prices for the same or similar issues and includes the impact of the conversion features.  
  The carrying amounts, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, and the estimated fair values of the Company's convertible debt as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are as follows (in thousands):

3.75% Convertible Senior Notes 
  In   June 2011  , the Company sold   $143.8 million   in principal amount of   3.75%   Convertible Senior Notes due   June 15, 2016   (the "3.75% Notes").  The interest rate on the notes was 3.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on   December 15   and   June 15   of each year.  The 3.75% Notes were convertible into the Company s common stock at an initial conversion rate of   38.1749   shares of common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of the 3.75% Notes, which was equivalent to a conversion price of approximately   $26.20   per share. 
  In connection with the issuance of the 3.75% Notes, the Company repurchased   $70 million   in principal amount of its   5.375%   Convertible Senior Notes due   June 15, 2013   (the "5.375% Notes") for   $85.1 million  , a   21.5%   premium on the principal amount.  The investors that held the   $70 million   in principal amount of repurchased 5.375% Notes purchased   $59.5 million   in principal amount of the 3.75% Notes and retained approximately   $13.5 million   in principal amount of the remaining 5.375% Notes.  These investors  combined   $73.0 million   in principal amount of convertible debt (  $13.5 million   of 5.375% Notes and   $59.5 million   of 3.75% Notes) was considered to be a modification of a portion of the 5.375% Notes and was accounted for separately from the issuance of the remainder of the 3.75% Notes.

     Table of Contents  

The Company recorded a total debt discount of   $25.8 million   related to the modified debt.  This discount consisted of   $10.5 million   related to the remaining debt discount on the   $70 million   in principal amount of 5.375% Notes repurchased,   $15.1 million   related to the premium payment in connection with the repurchase and   $0.2 million   related to the increase in the value of the conversion feature.  The total debt discount was being amortized as non-cash interest expense at the effective rate of   16.5%   over the   five   year term of the modified debt.  Additionally, the Company paid transaction fees of approximately   $2.0 million   related to the modification, which were recorded as interest and other expense at the time of the modification. 
  Of the   $143.8 million   in principal amount of 3.75% Notes issued in June 2011,   $84.3 million   in principal amount was considered to be an issuance of new debt.  The Company recorded a debt discount of   $26.6 million   related to the   $84.3 million   in principal amount of 3.75% Notes.  The debt discount was recorded as additional paid-in capital to reflect the value of its nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of   12.4%   per annum and was being amortized as non-cash interest expense over the   five   year term of the 3.75% Notes.  The Company incurred deferred financing costs related to this offering of approximately   $2.8 million  , of which   $0.9 million   has been reclassified as an offset to the value of the amount allocated to equity.  The remainder was recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and was being amortized as non-cash interest expense over the   five   year term of the 3.75% Notes. 
  In June 2014, in connection with the issuance of   $201.3 million   in principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes due   June 15, 2019   (the  2% Notes ), the Company repurchased approximately   $114.9 million   in principal amount of the 3.75% Notes for   $160.7 million  , a premium of   $45.8 million   over the principal amount.  Investors that held approximately   $80.0 million   of 3.75% Notes purchased approximately   $98.2 million   in principal amount of the 2% Notes.  The repurchase of the 3.75% Notes was treated as an extinguishment of debt since the fair value of the conversion feature changed by more than 10%.  The extinguishment of the 3.75% Notes was accounted for separately from the issuance of the 2% Notes.  The   $160.7 million   paid to extinguish the debt was allocated to debt and equity based on their respective fair values immediately prior to the transaction.  The Company allocated   $112.4 million   of the payment to the debt and   $48.3 million   to equity.  
  The 3.75% Notes were convertible at the option of the holder during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 since the last reported sales price per share of the Company's common stock was equal to or greater than   130%   of the conversion price for at least   20   of the   30   trading days ended on March 31, 2014.  The 3.75% Notes and any unpaid interest were convertible at the Company s option for cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock. 
  Beginning on   June 20, 2014  , the Company had the right to redeem the 3.75% Notes, at its option, in whole or in part, if the last reported sale price per share of the Company s common stock was at least   130%   of the conversion price then in effect for at least   20   trading days during a period of   30   consecutive trading days.  In June 2014, the Company met the redemption requirements and notified holders of its intent to redeem the outstanding   $28.8 million   in principal amount of 3.75% Notes in July 2014.  Prior to the redemption date, holders of   $28.5 million   in principal amount of 3.75% Notes exercised their right to convert their outstanding 3.75% Notes.  The Company settled this conversion of the 3.75% Notes in July 2014 by providing cash of   $28.5 million   for the principal amount of the outstanding 3.75% Notes converted and issuing   348,535   shares of common stock for the conversion premium totaling   $12.6 million  , for a total consideration paid of   $41.1 million  .  The Company settled the redemption of the remaining   $0.3 million   in principal amount in exchange for a cash payment of   $0.3 million   representing principal and accrued and unpaid interest.  The Company allocated   $27.9 million   of the total consideration paid to the debt and   $13.5 million   to equity.  
  The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $23.2 million   in connection with the repurchase and redemption of the 3.75% Notes during the year ended December 31, 2014, representing the excess of the   $140.3 million   allocated to the debt over its carrying value, net of deferred financing costs. 
  Certain features related to a portion of the 3.75% Notes, including the holders  ability to require the Company to repurchase their notes and the higher interest payments required in an event of default, were considered embedded derivatives and were required to be bifurcated and accounted for at fair value.  The Company assessed the value of these embedded derivatives at each balance sheet date. 
  As of December 31, 2014,   no   amounts remain outstanding related to the 3.75% Notes.  
  2% Convertible Senior Notes 
  In June 2014, the Company sold   $201.3 million   in principal amount of the   2%   Notes due   June 15, 2019  .  The interest rate on the notes is 2% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on   June 15   and   December 15   of each year.  The 2% Notes are convertible into the Company s common stock at an initial conversion rate of   21.5019   shares of common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of the 2% Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately   $46.51   per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.

     Table of Contents  

The Company recorded a debt discount of   $35.6 million   related to the 2% Notes.  The debt discount was recorded as additional paid-in capital to reflect the value of the Company s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of   6.2%   per annum.  This debt discount is being amortized as non-cash interest expense over the   five   year term of the 2% Notes.  The Company incurred deferred financing costs related to this offering of approximately   $6.7 million  , of which   $1.2 million   has been reclassified as an offset to the value of the amount allocated to equity.  The remainder is recorded as a reduction to debt in the consolidated balance sheet and is being amortized as non-cash interest expense over the   five   year term of the 2% Notes. 
  In September 2016, in connection with the issuance of   $345 million   in principal amount of   1.25%   Convertible Senior Notes due September 2021 (the "1.25% Notes"), the Company repurchased approximately   $134.2 million   in principal amount of the 2% Notes for   $153.6 million   (excluding accrued interest of   $0.7 million  ). The extinguishment of the 2% Notes was accounted for separately from the issuance of the 1.25% Notes as both transactions were viewed as arm's-length in nature and were not contingent upon one another. The   $153.6 million   paid to extinguish the debt was allocated to debt and equity based on their respective fair values immediately prior to the transaction. The fair value of the debt was estimated using a trinomial lattice model based on the following inputs: Company's stock price, expected volatility, term to maturity, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. The Company allocated   $121.4 million   of the payment to the debt and   $32.9 million   to equity.  
  The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $2.6 million   in connection with the repurchase and redemption of the 2% Notes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing the excess of the   $121.4 million   allocated to the debt over its carrying value, net of unamortized debt discount, deferred financing costs and accrued interest. 
  The 2% Notes contain provisions that allow for additional interest to the holders of the Notes upon the failure to timely file documents or reports that the Company is required to file with the SEC. The additional interest is at a rate of   0.25%   per annum of the principal amount of the notes outstanding for the first   180   days and   0.50%   per annum of the principal amount of the notes outstanding for a period up to   360   days.   
  If the Company is purchased by a company outside of the U.S., then additional taxes may be required to be paid by the Company under the terms of the 2% Notes. 
  The Company determined that the higher interest and tax payments required in certain circumstances are considered embedded derivatives and should be bifurcated and accounted for at fair value.  The Company assesses the value of the embedded derivatives at each balance sheet date.  The derivatives had de minimis value at the balance sheet date.  
  Cash interest expense related to the 2% Notes was $  0.9 million   and $  1.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  Cash interest expense related to the 2% Notes was $  2.9 million   and $  3.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
  Non-cash interest expense related to the 2% Notes was $  1.6 million   and   $1.9 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  Non-cash interest expense related to the 2% Notes was $  5.6 million   and $  5.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company included   $59.1 million   and   $171.7 million  , respectively, on its balance sheet in long-term debt related to the 2% Notes.  
  1.25% Convertible Senior Notes 
  In September 2016, the Company sold   $345.0 million   in principal amount of the   1.25%   Notes, which mature on September 15, 2021.      The interest rate on the notes is 1.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on March 15 and September 15 of each year. Interest began accruing on September 13, 2016; the first interest payment is due on March 15, 2017.  The 1.25% Notes are convertible into the Company s common stock at an initial conversion rate of   17.1332   shares of common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of the 1.25% Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately   $58.37   per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.  The 1.25% Notes will be convertible prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 15, 2021 only under certain circumstances and during certain periods, and will be convertible on or after June 15, 2021 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding September 15, 2021, regardless of those circumstances.  
  The Company recorded a debt discount of $  66.7 million   related to the 1.25% Notes which results from allocating a portion of the proceeds to the fair value of the conversion feature.  The fair value of the debt discount was estimated using a trinomial lattice model based on the following inputs: Company's stock price, expected volatility, term to maturity, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. The debt discount was recorded as additional paid-in capital and the remaining liability reflects the value of the Company s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of   5.8%   per annum. This debt discount is being amortized as non-cash interest expense over the   five   year term of the 1.25% Notes. The Company incurred debt

The remainder is presented as a reduction of debt in the consolidated balance sheet, is being amortized using the effective interest method, and is recorded as non-cash interest expense over the   five   year term of the 1.25% Notes. 
  The 1.25% Notes contain provisions that allow for additional interest to holders of the Notes upon failure to timely file documents or reports that the Company is required to file with the SEC. The additional interest is at a rate of   0.50%   per annum of the principal amounts of the notes outstanding for a period of 360 days.  
  If the Company merges or consolidates with a foreign entity, then additional taxes may be required to be paid by the Company under the terms of the 1.25% Notes.  
  The Company determined that the higher interest payments required and tax payments required in certain circumstances are considered embedded derivatives and should be bifurcated and accounted for at fair value.  The Company assesses the value of the embedded derivatives at each balance sheet date.  The derivatives had de minimis value at the balance sheet date.  
  Cash interest expense related to the 1.25% Notes was   $0.2 million   in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. Non-cash interest expense related to the 1.25% Notes was $  0.5 million   in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016.

Note 8. Net Loss Per Share 
  Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding unvested restricted common shares.  Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and, when dilutive, potential common share equivalents from options, restricted stock units and warrants (using the treasury-stock method), and potential common shares from convertible securities (using the if-converted method).  Because the Company reported a net loss for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , all potential dilutive common shares have been excluded from the computation of the diluted net loss per share for all periods presented, as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
  Potential dilutive common share equivalents consist of the following:   

Note   9  . Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
  Accounts receivable consist of amounts due from distributors, third-party payors, patients, and government agencies.  The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts at the time potential collection risk is identified.  The Company estimates its allowance based on historical experience, assessment of specific risk, discussions with individual customers or various assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  The Company believes the reserve is adequate to mitigate current collection risk. 
  Customers that represented greater than 10% of accounts receivable as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

Note   11  . Other Intangible Assets 
  The Company s finite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.  The Company assesses its intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.  The Company recognizes an impairment loss for intangibles and other finite-lived assets if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable based on its undiscounted future cash flows.  Any such impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.  The estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows requires the Company to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside its control.  Changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations.   
  The Company recorded   $32.9 million   of other intangible assets as a result of the acquisition of Neighborhood Diabetes in 2011.  In December 2015, the Company completed a long-lived asset impairment test for Neighborhood Diabetes and determined that the carrying value of the long-lived asset group, which included intangible assets, exceeded the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group.  The Company compared the fair value of the intangible assets and the related asset group, which was estimated based on the subsequent sales price of the asset group as of February 2016.  An impairment charge of   $9.0 million   was recorded within general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The impairment charge was allocated on a pro-rata basis based on the carrying value of the assets within the asset group.  As a result, impairment charges of approximately   $7.4 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively, were recorded on the customer relationship and tradename intangible assets.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the remaining balance of the other intangible assets associated with the acquisition of Neighborhood Diabetes were removed from the balance sheet as part of the divestiture and included in the calculated loss of disposal.  No further impairment was recorded upon the sale. 
  The Company recorded   $2.1 million   of other intangible assets in 2015 as a result of the July 2015 acquisition of its Canadian distribution business.  The Company determined that the estimated useful life of the contractual relationship asset is   5 years   and is amortizing the asset based on the expected cash flows of the assets.  
  The components of other intangible assets are as follows (in thousands): 

Amortization expense for intangible assets, excluding discontinued operations, was approximately $  0.1 million   and   $0.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Amortization expense for intangible assets, excluding discontinued operations, was approximately   $0.5 million   and   $0.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. Amortization expense is recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Amortization expense expected for the next five years and thereafter is as follows (in thousands):   

  As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average amortization period of the Company s intangible assets is approximately   4.25 years  .

  Product Warranty Costs 
  The Company provides a   four  -year warranty on its PDMs sold in the United States and a   five   year warranty on its PDMs sold in Canada and may replace any Omnipods that do not function in accordance with product specifications.  The Company estimates its warranty at the time the product is shipped based on historical experience and the estimated cost to service the claims. Warranty expense is recorded in cost of goods sold on the statement of operations.  As these estimates are based on historical experience, and the Company continues to introduce new products and versions, the Company also considers the anticipated performance of the product over its warranty period in estimating warranty reserves.

Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is in the process of responding to a revised audit report received in December 2015 on behalf of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the State of New York alleging overpayment of certain Medicaid claims to Neighborhood Diabetes.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had determined that it was probable that a loss had been incurred and recorded an aggregate liability of   $0.4 million   through general and administrative expense, which was reduced to   $0.3 million   during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The change in the liability was recorded in discontinued operations. 
  In May 2016, the Company reached a settlement agreement for   $0.5 million   with the Connecticut Department of Social Services Office of Quality Assurance relating to an audit alleging overpayment of certain Medicaid claims to Neighborhood Diabetes.  The settlement amount for this audit was consistent with the amount previously accrued. 
  In April 2016, the Company reached a settlement agreement for   $0.5 million   with the Massachusetts Department of Revenue for sales and use tax audits related to Insulet Corporation, which resulted in a   $0.2 million   reduction of the previously recorded liability and a credit to general and administrative expenses during the three months ending March 31, 2016.  
  Between   May 5, 2015   and   June 16, 2015  ,   three   class action lawsuits were filed by shareholders in the U.S. District Court, Massachusetts, against the Company and certain individual current and former executives of the Company.    Two   suits subsequently were voluntarily dismissed.    Arkansas Teacher Retirement System v. Insulet, et al.  , 1:15-cv-12345, which remains outstanding, alleges that the Company (and certain executives) committed violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making allegedly false and misleading statements about the Company s business, operations, and prospects.  The lawsuit seeks, among other things, compensatory damages in connection with the Company s allegedly inflated stock price between May 7, 2013 and April 30, 2015, as well as attorneys  fees and costs.  Due in part to the preliminary nature of this matter, the Company currently cannot reasonably estimate a possible loss, or range of loss, in connection with this matter. 
  The Company is, from time to time, involved in the normal course of business in various legal proceedings, including intellectual property, contract employment and product liability suits.  Although the Company is unable to quantify the exact financial impact of any of these matters, the Company believes that none of these currently pending matters will have an outcome material to its financial condition or business. 
   
  Note   14  . Equity 
  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC 718-10,   Compensation   Stock Compensation   ( ASC 718-10 ), which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock units, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.  Share-based payments that contain performance conditions are recognized when such conditions are probable of being achieved.  
  The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted-average fair value of options granted and determines the intrinsic value of restricted stock units based on the closing price of its common stock on the date of grant.  The Company recognizes the compensation expense of share-based awards on a straight-line basis for awards with only service conditions and on an accelerated method for awards with performance conditions.  Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards. 
  The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards utilizing the Black-Scholes model is affected by the stock price and the following assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life of the awards, the risk-free interest rate, and the dividend yield.  The expected volatility is computed over expected terms based upon the historical volatility of the Company's stock. The expected life of the awards is estimated based on the midpoint scenario, which  
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

combines historical exercise data with hypothetical exercise data for outstanding options. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the awards. The dividend yield assumption is based on Company history and an expectation of paying no dividends. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest. The Company evaluates the assumptions used to value the awards on a quarterly basis and if factors change and different assumptions are utilized, stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what has been recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, the Company may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock-based compensation expense. 
  Stock-based compensation expense related to share-based awards recognized in the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   $6.1 million   and   $4.2 million  , respectively, based upon when the awards are ultimately expected to vest. Stock-based compensation expense related to the share-based awards recognized in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   $16.9 million   and   $13.8 million  , respectively, and was also calculated based on when the awards are ultimately expected to vest.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $47.0 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options and restricted stock units. 
  Stock Options 
  In May 2007, in conjunction with the Company's initial public offering, the Company adopted its 2007 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan").  The 2007 Plan was amended and restated in November 2008, May 2012 and May 2015 to provide for the issuance of additional shares and to amend certain other provisions.  Under the 2007 Plan, awards may be granted to persons who are, at the time of grant, employees, officers, non-employee directors or key persons (including consultants and prospective employees) of the Company.  The 2007 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock awards, restricted stock, unrestricted stock, cash-based awards, performance share awards or dividend equivalent rights.  Options granted under the 2007 Plan generally vest over a period of   four   years and expire   ten   years from the date of grant.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   4,404,847   shares remain available for future issuance under the 2007 Plan.  
  The Company awarded   194,500   shares of incentive stock options in 2015 and an additional   55,000   shares of incentive stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that include vesting periods that may be accelerated. The stock options were granted under the 2007 Plan and vest over a   four   year period from the grant date with the potential of an accelerated vesting period pursuant to the achievement of certain performance conditions. Performance awards are amortized over the service period using an accelerated attribution method. 
  The following summarizes the activity under the Company s stock option plans in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  :   

(1)   
    The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated based on the positive difference between the pre-tax fair value of the Company s common stock as of the date of exercise and the exercise price of the underlying options.  
               (2)   
    The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated based on the positive pre-tax difference between the closing price of the Company s common stock as of   September 30, 2016  , and the exercise price of the underlying options. 
               (3)   
    Represents the number of vested options as of   September 30, 2016  , plus the number of unvested options expected to vest as of   September 30, 2016  , based on the unvested options outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , adjusted for the estimated forfeiture. 
     
   23 

     Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016   there were   3,541,936   options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of   $32.05   and a weighted average remaining contractual life of   8.3 years  .  At   September 30, 2016   there were   1,347,219   options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of   $31.63   and a weighted average remaining contractual life of   7.4   years. 
  Employee stock-based compensation expense related to stock options in the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   $2.6 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively, and was based on awards ultimately expected to vest.  Employee stock-based compensation expense related to stock options in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   $7.4 million   and   $7.0 million  , respectively, and was based on awards ultimately expected to vest.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $22.3 million   of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options that will be recognized over a weighted average vesting period of   2.6   years. 
  Restricted Stock Units 
  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company awarded   581,777   restricted stock units to certain employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors, which included   153,992   restricted stock units subject to the achievement of performance conditions (performance-based restricted stock units).  The number of performance-based restricted stock units granted during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   that are expected to vest may vary based on the Company's quarterly evaluation of the probability of the performance criteria being achieved.  The Company recognized stock compensation expense of   $0.9 million   and   $2.0 million   in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   for performance-based restricted stock units that are expected to vest based on its evaluation of the performance criteria at September 30, 2016. The Company recognized stock compensation expense of   $0.4 million   and   $0.4 million   in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   for performance-based restricted stock units. Performance awards are amortized over the service period using an accelerated attribution method.  The restricted stock units were granted under the 2007 Plan and vest over a   three   year period from the grant date.   
  The restricted stock units granted during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   have a weighted average fair value of   $29.69   per share based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant and were valued at approximately   $17.3 million   on their grant date.  The Company is recognizing the compensation expense over the vesting period.  Approximately   $2.6 million   and   $1.7 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   and   $7.3 million   and   $6.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   of stock-based compensation expense related to the vesting of non-performance based restricted stock units was recognized using the straight line method.  Approximately   $24.7 million   of the fair value of the restricted stock units, including performance-based restricted stock units remained unrecognized as of   September 30, 2016   and will be recognized over a weighted average period of   2   year.  Under the terms of the awards, the Company will issue shares of common stock on each of the vesting dates.  
  The following table summarizes the status of the Company s restricted stock units in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  :   

  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
    
  The Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ) authorizes the issuance of up to a total of   380,000   shares of common stock to participating employees.  The Company will make one or more offerings each year to eligible employees to purchase stock under the ESPP.  Between January 1, 2008 and June 30, 2016, offering periods began on the first business day occurring on or after each January 1 and July 1 and ended on the last business day occurring on or before the following June 30 and December 31, respectively.   Beginning as of July 1, 2016, an offering period will begin on the first business day occurring on or after each December 1 and June 1 and will end on the last business day occurring on or before the following May 31 and November 30, respectively.  In order to permit a transition to the new offering cycle, a one-time offering period began on July 1, 2016 and will end on November 30, 2016. 
  Each employee who is a participant in the Company s ESPP may purchase up to a maximum of   800   shares per offering period or   $25,000   per year by authorizing payroll deductions of up to   10%   of his or her base salary. Unless the  
  
   24 

     Table of Contents  

participating employee withdraws from the offering period, his or her accumulated payroll deductions will be used to purchase common stock. 
  For all offering periods ending on or before June 30, 2016, the purchase price for each share purchased was   85%   of the fair market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period. For all offering periods beginning on or after July 1, 2016, the purchase price for each share purchased will be   85%   of the lower of (i) the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or (ii) the fair market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   shares contingently issued under the ESPP.  The Company recorded approximately   $0.1 million   of stock-based compensation expense in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and approximately   $0.1 million   of stock-based compensation expense in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   related to the ESPP. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded no significant stock-based compensation charges related to the ESPP. 
   
  Note   15  . Income Taxes 
  The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  
  The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10,   Income Taxes   ( ASC 740-10 ) on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its financial statements.  ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  In addition, ASC 740-10 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  The Company recognizes estimated interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  
  The Company files federal, state and foreign tax returns.  These returns are generally open to examination by the relevant tax authorities from   three   to   four   years from the date they are filed.  The tax filings relating to the Company's federal and state tax returns are currently open to examination for tax years 2013 through 2015 and 2010 through 2015, respectively.  In addition, the Company has generated tax losses since its inception in 2000.  These years may be subject to examination if the losses are carried forward and utilized in future years.  
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of its net deferred tax asset because it is not more likely than not that the future tax benefit will be realized. 
  Income tax expense from continuing operations consists of the following (in thousands):    

Income tax expense from discontinued operations was not significant in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Income tax expense from discontinued operations was $  0.4 million   and $  0.1 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
  The Company has generated deferred tax liabilities related to its amortization of acquired goodwill for tax purposes because the goodwill is not amortized for financial reporting purposes.  The tax amortization gives rise to a temporary difference and a tax liability, which will only reverse at the time of ultimate disposition or impairment of the underlying goodwill. Due to the uncertain timing of this reversal, the temporary difference cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income for purposes of determining a valuation allowance; therefore, the tax liability cannot be used to offset deferred tax assets.

The Company had   no   unrecognized tax benefits at   September 30, 2016  . 

16  . Segment Reporting 
  Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision-maker ("CODM") in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance of the segment. The Company has concluded that their Chief Executive Officer is the CODM as he is the ultimate decision maker for key operating decisions, determining the allocation of resources and assessing the financial performance of the Company. These decisions, allocations and assessments are performed by the CODM using consolidated financial information. Consolidated financial information is utilized by the CODM as the Company s current product offering primarily consists of the Omnipod System and drug delivery. The Company s products are relatively consistent and manufacturing is centralized and consistent across product offerings. Based on these factors, key operating decisions and resource allocations are made by the CODM using consolidated financial data and as such the Company has concluded that they operate as   one   segment.

  Executive Level Overview 
  We are primarily engaged in the development, manufacturing and sale of our proprietary Omnipod System, an innovative, discreet and easy-to-use continuous insulin delivery system for people with insulin-dependent diabetes.  The Omnipod System features a small, lightweight, self-adhesive disposable tubeless Omnipod device which is worn on the body for approximately three days at a time and its wireless companion, the handheld PDM.  Conventional insulin pumps require people with insulin-dependent diabetes to learn to use, manage and wear a number of cumbersome components, including up to 42 inches of tubing.  In contrast, the Omnipod System features only two discreet, easy-to-use devices that eliminate the need for a bulky pump, tubing and separate blood glucose meter, provides for virtually pain-free automated cannula insertion, communicates wirelessly and integrates a blood glucose meter.  We believe that the Omnipod System s unique proprietary design and features allow people with insulin-dependent diabetes to manage their diabetes with unprecedented freedom, comfort, convenience, and ease. 
  We began commercial sale of the Omnipod System in the United States in 2005.  We sell the Omnipod System and other diabetes management supplies in the United States through direct sales to customers or through our distribution partners.  The Omnipod System is currently available in multiple countries in Europe, Canada and Israel.  In July 2015, we executed an asset purchase agreement with GSK whereby we acquired assets associated with the Canadian distribution of our products and we assumed the distribution, sales, marketing, training and support activities for the Omnipod system in Canada.  
  In addition to using the Pod for insulin delivery, we also partner with global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to tailor the Omnipod technology platform for the delivery of subcutaneous drugs across multiple therapeutic areas.

In June 2011, we acquired Neighborhood Diabetes.  Through Neighborhood Diabetes, we provided customers with blood glucose testing supplies, traditional insulin pumps, pump supplies and pharmaceuticals and had the ability to process claims as either durable medical equipment or through pharmacy benefits.  In February 2016, we sold Neighborhood Diabetes to Liberty Medical.  Additional information regarding the disposition and treatment of our Neighborhood Diabetes business as discontinued operations is provided in note   3   to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
  Third Quarter   2016 Revenue Results: 
               
    International Omnipod revenue of $  19.1 million    
                
    Drug Delivery revenue of $  16.1 million    
     Our long-term financial objective is to achieve and sustain profitable growth.  Our efforts in 2016 are focused primarily on the global expansion of our customer base and increasing our operating performance.  Achieving these objectives is requiring additional investments in certain personnel and initiatives, as well as enhancements to our manufacturing efficiency and effectiveness.  We may continue to incur net losses in the near term in order to achieve these objectives.  However, we believe the accomplishment of our near-term objectives will have a positive impact on our financial condition in the future. 
   
  Components of Financial Operations  
  Revenue.    We derive most of our revenue from global sales of the Omnipod System.  Our revenue also includes sales of devices based on the Omnipod technology platform to global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the delivery of subcutaneous drugs across multiple therapeutic areas.    
  Cost of revenue.      Cost of revenue consists primarily of raw material, labor, warranty, inventory reserve and overhead costs such as freight-in and depreciation and the cost of products we acquire from third party suppliers.   
  Research and development.      Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and outside services within our product development, regulatory and clinical functions and product development projects.  We generally expense research and development costs as incurred.   
  Sales and marketing.      Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our sales, marketing, reimbursement support, customer care and training functions, sales commissions paid to our sales representatives, costs associated with promotional activities and participation in industry trade shows.  
  General and administrative.      General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the executive, finance, legal, information technology and human resource functions, as well as legal fees, accounting fees, insurance costs, bad debt expenses, shipping, handling and facilities-related costs.

Results of Operations 
  This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for the   third quarter   and the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods of   2015  , and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying condensed notes included in this Form 10-Q.   

  Revenue 
  Our total revenue increased to $  94.9 million  , up $  23.5 million  , or   33%  , in the   third quarter   of 2016 compared to the   third quarter   of 2015, due to strong growth in our U.S. Omnipod revenue, International Omnipod revenue and our on-body injection device for drug delivery.  Our U.S. Omnipod revenue increased primarily due to growth in our installed base of Omnipod users which was driven by the expansion in 2015 of our sales force and customer support personnel and strategic initiatives introduced in mid-2015 to expand awareness of the Omnipod System. Our International Omnipod revenue increased primarily due to growth in distributor sales from continued adoption in existing markets and to a lesser extent from entry into new markets. Our drug delivery revenue increased due to strong growth in demand for our drug delivery device following regulatory approval in December 2014.  
  Total revenue increased to $  263.4 million  , up $  83.3 million  , or   46%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with the same period in 2015, primarily due to strong growth in our U.S. Omnipod revenue, International Omnipod revenue and our on-body injection device for drug delivery. Our U.S. Omnipod revenue increased primarily due to growth in our installed base of Omnipod users which was greatly driven by the expansion in 2015 of our sales force and customer support personnel and strategic initiatives introduced in mid-2015 to expand awareness of the Omnipod System. The results for the first nine months of 2015 also were partially impacted by unfavorable distributor ordering patterns in the first quarter of 2015 which stabilized thereafter.  Our International Omnipod revenue increased primarily due to growth in distributor sales from continued adoption in existing markets and to a lesser extent from entry into new markets. The results for the first nine months of 2015 included lower International Omnipod sales which partially resulted from unfavorable distributor ordering patterns in the first and second quarters of 2015 which stabilized thereafter. Our drug delivery revenue increased due to strong growth in demand for our drug delivery device following regulatory approval in December 2014. 
  For the year ending December 31, 2016, we expect strong revenue growth, compared to 2015, across all of our product lines as we continue our expansion in the U.S. and internationally.  We expect strong growth of approximately 20% in our worldwide Omnipod installed base.  We also expect that the revenue from our drug delivery devices will be a higher relative percentage of our overall growth in 2016, as compared to 2015, as we increase commercial sales.

Cost of Revenue 
  Cost of revenue decreased to $  39.2 million  , down $  0.6 million   in the   third quarter   of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, due to approximately $7.7 million of costs incurred during the third quarter of 2015, considered non-recurring in nature, associated with certain product which ultimately did not meet our quality expectations, along with manufacturing efficiency and effectiveness improvements made in 2016.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales volumes.  
  Total cost of revenue increased to $  113.3 million  , up $  24.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in sales volumes, partially offset by $10.2 million of costs incurred during the first nine months of 2015 that were considered non-recurring in nature, along with manufacturing efficiency and effectiveness improvements made in 2016.  
    
  Gross Margin 
  Gross margin was approximately   59%   in the   third quarter   of 2016, compared with   44%   in the third quarter of 2015. The margin improvement was mainly due to $7.7 million of costs in the third quarter of 2015 that were considered non-recurring in nature along with manufacturing efficiency and effectiveness improvements made in 2016. 
  Gross margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   57%   compared with   51%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The margin improvement was mainly due to $10.2 million of costs in the first nine months of 2015 that were considered non-recurring in nature along with manufacturing efficiency and effectiveness improvements made in 2016. 
  For the year ending December 31, 2016, we expect gross margin to increase compared to 2015 primarily due to $10.2 million of costs incurred in the first nine months of 2015 that were considered non-recurring in nature along with  improvements to our manufacturing efficiency and effectiveness as demonstrated in the first nine months of 2016.  
    
  Research and Development 
  Research and development expenses for the   three month period ended September 30, 2016   were $  13.7 million   compared with $  10.0 million   for the same period in 2015. The approximate $  3.7 million   increase was the result of expenses related to our development projects, including our artificial pancreas program, mobile application development including interaction with continuous glucose monitoring technology, development efforts with Eli Lilly and Company for the use of concentrated insulin for patients with higher insulin-resistance and other Omnipod product improvement initiatives.  
  Research and development expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were $  39.7 million   compared with $  30.3 million   for the same period in 2015. The approximate $  9.4 million   increase was the result of expenses related to our development projects, including our artificial pancreas program, mobile application development including interaction with continuous glucose monitoring technology, development efforts with Eli Lilly and Company for the use of concentrated insulin for patients with higher insulin-resistance and other Omnipod product improvement initiatives.  
  For the year ending December 31, 2016, we expect overall research and development spending to increase due to the development efforts on our on-going projects including our artificial pancreas program, mobile application development including interaction with continuous glucose monitoring technology, development efforts with Eli Lilly and Company for the use of concentrated insulin, and the continued investment to support the use our technology as a delivery platform for other pharmaceuticals. 
    
  Sales and Marketing 
  Sales and marketing expenses for the   three month period ended September 30, 2016   were $  22.1 million   compared with $  21.3 million   for the same period in 2015. The approximate $  0.8 million   increase was mainly the result of a $1.4 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including increased incentive compensation costs on growth in the business, as well as costs associated with the expansion in 2015 of our sales force and customer support personnel, partially offset by a reduction in expenses associated with outside service providers.

     Table of Contents  

Sales and marketing expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were $  69.1 million   compared to $  55.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . The approximate $  14.1 million   increase was mainly the result of a $14.5 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including increased incentive compensation costs resulting from growth in the business, as well as costs associated with the expansion in 2015 of our sales force and customer support personnel, partially offset by a reduction in expenses associated with outside service providers. Additionally, there was an increase in costs associated with marketing efforts, new market opportunities and other strategic initiatives introduced in mid-2015 as we continue to expand awareness of the Omnipod System and our on-body injection devices for delivery of other pharmaceuticals. 
  We expect sales and marketing expenses in the year ending December 31, 2016 to increase as we see the full-year impact of the 2015 commercial team expansion and invest in initiatives that will enhance awareness, customer satisfaction and drive increased adoption of the Omnipod System, as well as increased adoption of our technology as a delivery platform for other pharmaceuticals. 
    
  General and Administrative 
  General and administrative expenses for the   three month period ended September 30, 2016   were $  17.3 million   compared with $  15.0 million   for the same period in 2015. The approximate $  2.3 million   increase was primarily attributable to personnel-related costs on higher incentive compensation associated with growth in our business, as well as additional staff to support our growth expectations and fees paid for external consultants. 
  General and administrative expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were $  47.9 million   compared to $  42.1 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The approximate $  5.9 million   increase was mainly due to employee compensation costs and fees paid for external consultants. 
  For the year ending December 31, 2016, we expect overall general and administrative expenses to increase as compared to 2015 as we continue to grow the business and make investments in our operating structure to support this continued growth.  
    
  Interest Expense and Other Income, Net 
  Interest expense and other income, net for the   three month period ended September 30, 2016  , were $  5.4 million   compared with $  3.1 million   for the same period in 2015. The approximate $  2.2 million   increase was mainly due to a $2.6 million charge recorded for the extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of $134.2 million in principal of the 2% Notes. This was partially offset from a slight decrease in capital lease interest expense.  
  Interest and other expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were $  11.3 million   compared to $  9.5 million   in   2015  . The approximate $  1.8 million   increase was mainly due to a $2.6 million charge recorded for the extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of $134.2 million in principal of the 2% Notes. This was partially offset from a slight decrease in capital lease interest expense.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $215.4 million   in cash and cash equivalents and   $67.3 million   in short-term investments.  We believe that our current liquidity, together with the cash expected to be generated from sales, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
  Debt 
  In September 2016, we sold   $345.0 million   in principal amount of the   1.25%   Notes, which mature on September 15, 2021.      The interest rate on the notes is 1.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on March 15 and September 15 of each year. Interest began accruing on September 13, 2016; the first interest payment is due on March 15, 2017.  The 1.25% Notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of   17.1332   shares of common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of the 1.25% Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately   $58.37   per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.  The 1.25% Notes will be convertible prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 15, 2021 only under certain circumstances and during certain periods, and will be convertible on or after June 15, 2021 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding September 15, 2021, regardless of those circumstances.

Cash interest expense related to the 1.25% Notes was   $0.2 million   in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. Non-cash interest expense related to the 1.25% Notes was $  0.5 million   in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. 
  In   June 2014  , we sold   $201.3 million   in principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes due   June 15, 2019   (the "2% Notes"). The interest rate on the notes is 2% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on   June 15   and   December 15   of each year. The 2% Notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of   21.5019 shares   of common stock per   $1,000 principal   amount of the 2% Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately   $46.51 per share  , subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. 
  In September 2016, in connection with the issuance of   $345.0 million   in principal amount of   1.25%   Convertible Senior Notes due September 2021 discussed above, we repurchased approximately $134.2 million in principal amount of the 2% Notes for $153.6 million (excluding accrued interest of $0.7 million). The extinguishment of the 2% Notes was accounted for separately from the issuance of the 1.25% Notes as both transactions were viewed as arm's-length in nature and were not contingent upon one another. The $154.3 million paid to extinguish the debt was allocated to debt and equity based on their respective fair values immediately prior to the transaction. We allocated $121.4 million of the payment to the debt and $32.9 million to equity.  
  Cash interest expense related to the 2% Notes was $  0.9 million   and $  1.0 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. Cash interest expense related to the 2% Notes was $  2.9 million   and $  3.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
  Non-cash interest expense related to the 2% Notes was $  1.6 million   and   $1.9 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. Non-cash interest expense related to the 2% Notes was $  5.6 million   and $  5.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
  Additional information regarding our debt issuances is provided in Note   6   to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
  Capital Leases 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have approximately   $13.7 million   of manufacturing equipment acquired under capital leases.  As of   September 30, 2016  , one capital lease remains outstanding and is being repaid in equal monthly installments over a   24   month term and includes principal and interest payments with an effective interest rate of   13%  .  
  Additional information regarding our capital leases is provided in note   7   to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
  Summary of Cash Flows   

  Operating Activities 
  Our net cash used in operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $4.2 million   compared to   $6.0 million   provided by operating activities in the same period of 2015.  The increase was primarily due to additional inventory purchases in order to support customer demand and to allow for alternative shipping methods which in turn is expected to lower our distribution costs, partially offset by a lower net loss recorded for the period. 
  Investing Activities 
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

Our net cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $80.8 million   compared to   $11.8 million   in 2015. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we invested   $76.2 million   into short-term investments.  There were no such investments in 2015. In addition, the increase in investing activities relates to higher capital purchases for the nine months ended 2016 compared to 2015, primarily associated with investments in supply chain operations including $9.8 million for equipment in process of construction to support our U.S. manufacturing initiatives. 
  Financing Activities 
  We had net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $177.6 million   compared to   $0.3 million   in 2015.  The increase was primarily attributable to net proceeds of $333.9 million in September 2016 from the issuance of the 1.25% Notes, offset by repayments of $153.6 million for extinguishment of approximately 67% of our outstanding 2% Notes.  
  Commitments and Contingencies 
  We lease our facilities in Massachusetts, California, Canada and Singapore.  Our leases are accounted for as operating leases.  The leases generally provide for a base rent plus real estate taxes and certain operating expenses related to the leases.  
  Certain of our operating lease agreements contain scheduled rent increases.  Rent expense is recorded using the straight-line method and deferred rent is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
          The following table summarizes our principal obligations as of September 30, 2016 (in thousands):   

  __________________ 
  (1) Debt obligations include principal and interest. Our senior convertible notes pay interest of 2% and 1.25% per annum.  
  (2) The effective interest rate on our capital lease obligations is 13%. Future interest payments are included in the amount of capital lease obligations presented. 
  (3) Our purchase obligations include commitments with certain of our suppliers, primarily for the purchase of Omnipod System components and manufacturing equipment along with other commitments to purchase goods or services in the normal course of business. We make such commitments through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information.  
    
  Legal Proceedings 
  The significant estimates and judgments related with establishing litigation reserves are discussed under "Legal Proceedings" in Note   13   to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying condensed notes.  Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty.  Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment.

Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements.  We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  We have made no material changes to the critical accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts.  Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, debt and long-term obligations.  We consider investments that, when purchased, have a remaining maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.  The primary objectives of our investment strategy are to preserve principal, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields.  To minimize our exposure to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest mainly in cash equivalents.  We do not believe that a 10% change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our interest income. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding debt recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of   $412.1 million  , gross of deferred financing costs and unamortized debt discount, related to our 2% and 1.25% Notes; and   $1.1 million   related to capital lease obligations.  As the interest rates are fixed, changes in interest rates do not affect the value of our debt or capital lease obligations. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk.    Our business is subject to risks, including, but not limited to: unique economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.  We are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our subsidiary operation in Canada.  The majority of our sales outside of the U.S. are transacted in U.S. dollars and are not subject to material foreign currency fluctuations.  
  Fluctuations in foreign currency rates could affect our sales, cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses.  In addition, currency devaluations can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency.  A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in foreign currencies that we transact in would not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer.  In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we and our management recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.  Based upon that evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  Information regarding our legal proceedings is provided in Note   13   to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.  These risks are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 except for the following: 
    
  We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness represented by our 2% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2019 and our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due September 15, 2021. We may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or we may experience a financial failure. 
  In 2014, we sold $201.3 million in principal amount of 2% Convertible Senior Notes, due in 2019. In September 2016, we sold $345 million in principal amount of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes, due in 2021. In connection with the issuance of $345 million in 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes, we repurchased $134.2 million of our outstanding 2% Convertible Senior Notes. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance the 2% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes or other debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the 2% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our future debt agreements. In the absence of sufficient operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain sufficient proceeds from those dispositions to meet our debt service and other obligations when due.

  QUALITY AGREEMENT:  
  Attached as   Exhibit D 
  ________________________________________________________________________ 
    
  THIS MATERIALS SUPPLIER AGREEMENT (this    Agreement   ) is made and entered into as of the Effective Date indicated above, (the    Effective Date   ) by and between Insulet Corporation, a Delaware corporation, on behalf of itself and its worldwide affiliates, having a principal place of business at 600 Technology Park Drive, Suite 200, Billerica, MA 01821 (   Insulet   ), and Flextronics Medical Sales and Marketing, Ltd, a Mauritius, on behalf of itself and its worldwide affiliates, having a principal place of business at Level 3, Alexander House 35, Cybercity, Ebene, Mauritius (the    Supplier   ).  Insulet and Supplier are referred to herein individually as a  Party  and collectively as the  Parties . 
    
  For and in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows: 
    
           1. 
    General  .  This Agreement, together with all schedules and exhibits attached hereto along with all documents and/or prior agreements expressly incorporated by reference is the entire agreement and will be the controlling document in business dealings between the Parties with respect to the Products (as defined in Section 3 below) supplied hereunder.  It supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements (including without limitation that certain Manufacturing Services Agreement by and between the Parties dated as of January 3, 2007, as amended to date), purchase orders and acknowledgments between the Parties relating to such Products, except as expressly stated below.  Purchase commitments will be made only by means of Purchase Orders as defined in Section 6(a)(ii) below.  Insulet and Supplier preprinted terms and conditions on any future purchase order, invoice, acknowledgment or other standard form shall not apply unless expressly agreed to in the particular case by both Parties in writing. 
     Any subsidiary or affiliate of Insulet shall have the right to purchase products under this Agreement by providing written notice to Supplier of such subsidiary or affiliate s intention to purchase Products hereunder in advance of issuing any Purchase Orders.  Supplier agrees, and each such subsidiary or affiliate who places orders under this Agreement agrees (by the act of placing such orders), that all

EXHIBIT 10.1 

terms and conditions of the Agreement shall apply to such orders and resulting purchases as if the name of the subsidiary or affiliate was substituted for the term  Insulet  wherever it appears in this Agreement.  Supplier will bill each Insulet subsidiary and affiliate separately for all products provided to such subsidiary or affiliate and Supplier agrees to collect from Affiliates first, if however the Affiliate fails to pay any undisputed amounts within [*] days after notice by Supplier, Supplier may then invoice any outstanding undisputed amounts to Insulet.  Each subsidiary or affiliate will only be liable for those obligations expressly applicable to such subsidiary or affiliate whether set forth in this Agreement or the   Exhibit   to which it is a party. 
  Also, at Insulet s option and written direction, Supplier will allow Insulet s designated    Higher Level Supplier(s)    to purchase Products (as defined below), under the terms of this Agreement, solely for the purpose of incorporating those Products into products that the Higher Level Supplier produces for Insulet.  In such event, Supplier shall sell the Products to such Higher Level Supplier(s), subject to Supplier s reasonable credit approval of the Higher Level Supplier(s) and subject to such Higher Level Suppliers(s) written agreement to be bound by Supplier s reasonable terms of sale; provided that such terms of sale are consistent with the terms contained herein.  The pricing for such sales shall be the pricing provided herein.  The Higher Level Supplier(s) shall be solely responsible for payment for Products, and for other payments provided herein based on the Delivery Schedule, the Flexibility Schedule and the Supply Chain Profiles, all as detailed below, on the same basis that Insulet would be responsible if Insulet were providing the Delivery Schedule.  However, all matters with respect to Products sold to the Higher Level Suppliers shall be handled directly between Supplier and Insulet under the terms of this Agreement.  
           2. 
    Term of Agreement  .  The initial term of this Agreement shall commence upon the Effective Date and shall be for the period identified above as    Initial Contract Term   , unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 16 herein.  Upon the expiration of the Initial Contract Term, the term of this Agreement shall automatically extend until the earlier of:  (a) termination of this Agreement by (i) Insulet upon at least [*] ([*]) [*] prior written notice to Supplier or (ii) Supplier upon at least [*] ([*]) [*] prior written notice to Insulet; or (b) replacement of this Agreement by another written agreement of the Parties.  The Initial Contract Term together with any extensions as provided by this Section 2 is referred to in this Agreement as the    Term   . 
              3. 
    Products; Supply Commitment  .   
              a. 
    Products  .  This Agreement covers purchases of products listed on   Exhibit A   attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference or added to   Exhibit A   as provided below (collectively,    Products   ).  Each Product is defined by reference to a Insulet drawing (each, a    Drawing   ).  Drawings are referenced by part number and revision level and may include and/or reference:  specifications, test instructions, quality instructions, manufacturing instructions, assembly instructions and a bill of materials (including approved vendors).  Each Drawing and all documents referenced therein, as well as all revisions to Drawings made in accordance with this Section 3, are referred to in this Agreement as the    Specifications    for the Products covered by the Drawing.  For each business day Supplier shall provide to Insulet a daily report, in an electronic format, detailing all the applicable information relating to the manufacture of Products in a form mutually agreed to by the Parties.  Supplier agrees to provide such reports in a form and to include such information and metrics that Insulet may request from time to time.

EXHIBIT 10.1 

b. 
    Additional Products  .  From time to time, the Parties may mutually agree to add Products to this Agreement by executing an amended   Exhibit A  .  However, in the absence of an amended   Exhibit A  , if Supplier issues a written price quotation to Insulet (whether in response to a Drawing submitted by Insulet, as part of a pricing event contemplated by this Section 3 or Sections 4, or as part of a new product proposal by Supplier), and Insulet places order(s) for such product, then such product shall automatically be deemed added to   Exhibit A   at the price quoted and shall be deemed a Product under this Agreement. 
              c. 
    Changes to Specifications  .  Drawings may be revised from time to time as mutually agreed in writing between the Parties (either by execution of an amended   Exhibit A   that references the new revision level or other writings of the Parties).  Supplier shall not unreasonably withhold approval to Drawings or Specifications changes proposed in writing by Insulet (each change an    Engineering Change    or    EC   ).  Supplier will use commercially reasonable efforts to evaluate the feasibility of the EC requested by Insulet within [*] ([*]) business days of receipt and respond to Insulet in writing with the potential impact of the EC on current on-hand or on-order component inventory, work-in-progress Products (   WIP   ), finished goods Products, and/or the Delivery Schedule.  In addition to the written response provided above, Supplier will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to Insulet within [*] ([*]) business days with a written evaluation of the EC including:  (i) engineering time to implement the EC, (ii) the cost to modify Tools or test fixtures or similar non-recurring expenses, (iii) the quantity of Obsolete Items (as defined in Section 8(a) below) Supplier has on hand and/or on order with its suppliers related to the EC, (iv) the cost to rework WIP (if applicable) and any impacts to Product price resulting from the EC, (v) the expected effect on the Delivery Schedule to include (if applicable) the effect on all in-process work (e.g., re-workable, repairable, etc.), (vi) any changes to Supply Chain Profiles, and (vii) the manner in which the EC will be implemented by Supplier.  Supplier will not proceed to implement the EC until Insulet has approved the charges and Supplier actions described in the Supplier evaluation that is provided to Insulet. 
              d. 
    Manufacturing and Delivery Commitment  .  For the Term of this Agreement, Supplier commits to supply to Insulet, in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, such quantities of the Products listed on   Exhibit A   (including those added as provided above) as Insulet may choose to order under the terms of this Agreement and which Supplier has agreed to supply in accordance with the terms hereof.  There are no purchase volume commitments by Insulet under this Agreement (except for the binding forecast in Section 6(a)(i)), and Insulet reserves the right to purchase the Products or similar items from other suppliers.  If Supplier fails to deliver the total quantity of Products ordered by Insulet in any Purchase Order by the date of delivery specified therein, then, (i) at Insulet s option, Insulet may have the remaining portion of the order of Product shipped by air freight at Supplier s sole cost and expense and (ii) Supplier shall use commercially reasonable efforts to identify the root cause of the failure and provide such information to Insulet as soon as reasonably possible.  Thereafter, the Parties agree to engage in a management review and remediation process to prevent such failure from reoccurring.  Regardless of whether Insulet orders replacement or substitute Products from another source, Supplier shall remain obligated to deliver the total quantity ordered by Insulet, unless Insulet notifies Supplier that Insulet is canceling its order with respect to the amount of the shortfall.

EXHIBIT 10.1 

a. 
    General  .  During the Term, prices shall be calculated in accordance with the price model set forth on   Exhibit A   (including those for Products added to   Exhibit A   as provided in Section 3 above).  All prices shall be in U.S. Dollars.  The purchase price shall include all costs for adequate packaging as suitable for transport by road and/or as further specified under the Specifications listed in this   Exhibit A  . 
              b. 
    Cost Reduction  . Supplier hereby agrees to identify areas wherein cost savings can be realized and passed on to Insulet through productivity improvements and cost savings (   Cost Savings   ).  Such Cost Savings shall be reflected as a reduction of prices set forth in   Exhibit A  .  Supplier hereby agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to [*]; provided, that Insulet will review and approve any recommended productivity change requested by Supplier as soon as practicable after submission of such change; provided, further, in each case, that such requested change does not otherwise adversely impact the quality of the Products. 
              c. 
    Process Improvements  .  In the event Supplier implements any operational excellence or other process improvements at Insulet s suggestion and under Insulet s guidance, Supplier shall pass 100% of the savings attributable to such improvement, after Supplier recoups costs and expenses specifically and actually incurred by Supplier as a result of the development and implementation of such improvements (if any), along to Insulet and such savings shall not be included in the Productivity Savings Goal set forth above.   
              d. 
    Business Review  .  Insulet may conduct reviews of the Supplier s operations, books and records, and other documentation relating to the pricing model and components thereof agreed to by the parties at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, annually during the Term and more often as may reasonably be necessary in order to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
              e. 
    Taxes  .  Except to the extent that Insulet s purchase of the Products is exempt from such taxes as evidenced by a written certification of exemption provided by Insulet, Insulet shall bear all applicable sales, use, excise, value added (VAT) or similar federal, state, municipal and other taxes payable with respect to the sale by Supplier to Insulet of the Products as finished goods and any property taxes assessable on the Products after delivery to Insulet.  If Supplier is required to collect and remit any such taxes, then Supplier shall add such taxes to the invoice for sale of the Products, and Supplier agrees to remit such taxes as collected to the proper taxing authorities.  With respect to the medical device excise tax pursuant to IRC  4191 (   MDET   ), Supplier hereby acknowledges and agrees that for purposes of this Agreement, Insulet shall be deemed the holder of the regulatory filing with respect to all applicable products and is therefore deemed the manufacturer of such products.  Furthermore, Insulet shall be deemed the responsible payor with respect to MDET and Supplier hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall not remit or make any payments with respect thereto.  To the extent that Supplier does remit or make payment for MDET, Supplier acknowledges and agrees that Insulet will not reimburse Supplier for any portion of such payments.  Supplier shall be responsible for payment of any taxes relating to the Products or production thereof that are not based on transfer of the Products to Insulet or that are based on the income of Supplier (rather than on the transfer of the Products).  Each Party hereby indemnifies the

other Party for any government claims or fines, other than the amount of any tax owed by such Party and not paid to the other Party, against such Party due to the other Party s failure to remit or pay to applicable taxing authorities any taxes or similar charges that are the responsibility of the other Party to pay or remit, including any taxes collected from such Party for remittance by the other Party.  In the event Insulet is required to withhold taxes from amounts paid to Supplier hereunder and remit such taxes to a taxing authority, Supplier expressly authorizes Insulet to do so. 
            a. 
    Shipping Terms  .  The Parties agree that the shipping terms for each Product sold hereunder on   Exhibit A     shall be [*] (Incoterm 2010) [*] facility as specified by the parties.  Except as otherwise set forth on   Exhibit A  , the following terms shall apply to all Products and components Supplier purchases for use in manufacturing the Products: [*] shall arrange for shipping through carriers designated by [*] who will invoice the shipping charges directly to [*] for all inbound and outbound shipments to and from Supplier for or on behalf of Insulet.  (Alternatively, if directed by Insulet, Supplier shall arrange shipping (pursuant to instructions which Supplier shall request from Insulet's Shipping Department) and prepay and add the shipping charges to the invoice as a separate line item).  Supplier shall bear all risk of loss or damage to Products until the Products are delivered to [*].  Supplier shall obtain, at Supplier s expense, all export licenses and shall carry out all customs formalities related to the export of the goods.  Insulet agrees to provide Supplier, within [*] ([*]) days of request, with each of the following in order to enable Supplier to fulfill its responsibility for export formalities: (i) export control classification numbers and harmonized tariff schedule information for Insulet s assemblies and sub-assemblies; (ii) information sufficient to allow Supplier to clear shipments under laws and regulations pertaining to restricted parties and/or prohibited countries; and (iii) other information in Insulet s possession that Supplier reasonably requests to assist in fulfilling Supplier s export clearance responsibilities.  Insulet shall obtain, at Insulet s expense, all import licenses and shall pay all import customs duties and fees, as well as carrying out all custom formalities and shall be the importer of record, unless otherwise indicated on   Exhibit A  .  Title for the Products shall transfer upon delivery to carrier. 
              b. 
    Anti-Terrorism Measures  .  Supplier agrees to designate, (and in the event Insulet designates, then Insulet agrees to designate,) only freight carriers that are currently in compliance with all applicable laws relating to anti-terrorism security measures and to adhere to the C-TPAT (Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism) security recommendations and guidelines as outlined by the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and to prohibit the freight carriage to be sub-contracted to any carrier that is not in compliance with the C-TPAT guidelines.

covering at least a [*] ([*]) month period.  Unless otherwise set forth in   Exhibit A  , the first [*] ([*]) months of the forecast/schedule will include specific delivery dates; the remainder of the forecast/schedule will identify monthly quantities.  The forecast/schedule described in this subsection (i) is called the  Delivery Schedule .  The Delivery Schedule will be updated at least once every month and will be subject to the change provisions set forth in Section 6(b) below.  Within the Delivery Schedule, each quantity that Insulet indicates for a particular delivery date or time period (e.g., a time period where quantities are shown only on a monthly basis) is known as a    Scheduled Delivery   . 
           ii. 
    Order Methods  .  Insulet may place orders under this Agreement for quantities and delivery dates or time periods by giving Supplier prior written notice consistent with the agreed to lead time for the applicable Product as set forth in the applicable   Exhibit  ; provided, that if no such lead time is identified, at least [*] ([*]) days prior written notice.  These orders may be in the form of the Delivery Schedule described in Section 6(a)(i) above or standard purchase order documents (which may be  standalone  purchase orders or  blanket purchase orders  with quantities scheduled by  releases ) or other written means mutually arranged by the Parties (each a    Purchase Order    and collectively the    Purchase Orders   ).  Regardless of the means by which Insulet informs Supplier of quantities and delivery dates, each quantity that Insulet indicates for a particular delivery date or time period is known as a    Scheduled Delivery   .  
              b. 
    Delivery Schedules; Updates; Procedure; Changes  .  Supplier agrees to supply Scheduled Deliveries that Insulet submits in accordance with Section 6(a) above, as increased or decreased by Insulet within the permitted changes allowed under the Flexibility Table referenced in Section 6(c) below without any expedited cost or expense;   provided  ,   however  , that any Scheduled Deliveries may also be cancelled by Insulet in accordance with Section 15 below (Cancellation for Convenience), including the financial responsibility provisions in such Section 15, or cancelled by an applicable party for cause as provided in Section 16 below (Cancellations for Cause, including the financial responsibility provisions in such Section 16); and   provided  ,   further  , that if the Parties mutually agree to changes for Scheduled Deliveries that are beyond the scope of the changes permitted in the Flexibility Table, then Supplier shall supply those revised Scheduled Deliveries.   
              c. 
    Zones  .  At any particular time, each Scheduled Delivery (or forecasted quantity) is considered to fall into one of a number of zones as shown in the    Flexibility Table    attached hereto as   Exhibit B   and incorporated herein by reference (each a  Zone  and collectively the    Zones   ), depending on how much calendar time remains until the date of that Scheduled Delivery (or forecasted quantity).  For any Scheduled Delivery, Insulet may (i) increase or decrease the quantity of Products or (ii) reschedule the quantity of Products and their shipment dates in accordance with the Flexibility Table.  In the event that Insulet cancels quantities outside the Frozen Zone beyond the amounts of allowable quantity decreases in the Scheduled Delivery Change Table), such cancellations will be subject to the provisions of Section 15 below (Cancellation for Convenience), including the financial responsibility provisions in such Section 15, or the provisions of Section 16 below (Cancellations for Cause), including the financial responsibility provisions in such Section 16.

d. 
    Supplier Response to Purchase Orders and Delivery Schedules  .  Whenever Insulet submits Delivery Schedule information, whether by means of a Purchase Order, change order, purchase order  release  or revised Delivery Schedule, Supplier agrees to respond to Insulet (by fax, email or equivalent written media) within [*] ([*]) business days after receipt.  The response should confirm receipt of the Purchase Order, change order, release or revised Delivery Schedule and inform Insulet if Supplier objects to any part of that submission as being contrary to the requirements of this Section 6.  With respect to the information submitted per this Section 6(d), if Supplier does not object to the Delivery Schedule information within those [*] ([*]) business days, then all portions of the Delivery Schedule will be deemed to comply with the requirements of Section 6. 
              e. 
    Stocking Hub  .  If mutually agreed by the Parties from time to time, including quantities and cost in a subsequent written agreement, for Products produced by Supplier which are consumed in a Insulet factory or by another supplier (not Distribution Center), Supplier may agree to establish one (1) or more warehousing sites (each, a    Hub   ) in or near the respective Insulet factories to which the Products will ultimately be delivered by Supplier.  Supplier will stock such of the Products as the Parties may mutually agree at each such Hub from which orders by the applicable Insulet facility(ies) will be fulfilled.  Supplier will retain ownership of such Products and shall bear the risk of loss or damage (for which Supplier shall maintain adequate insurance) while at the Hub(s) and until they are delivered to the Insulet facility or Insulet picks them up from the Hub, whichever occurs first.  Insulet may terminate the arrangements for a particular Hub or Product(s) on at least [*] ([*]) days  written notice to Supplier, and upon termination of the Hub, Insulet shall purchase all Products in the Hubs affected by the termination at the applicable Product price. 
     For mutually agreed Hubs and Products, Supplier shall at all times maintain in the Hub a target quantity of buffer inventory (   Buffer Inventory   ) of Product (which may be based on currently Scheduled Deliveries/Forecast out [*] ([*]) months).  This Buffer Inventory is in addition to finished goods and WIP that Supplier needs to maintain in order to fill Scheduled Deliveries.  The Buffer Inventory is required to shorten lead time of the Products as well as guard against disruptions in raw materials supply.  Supplier shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fill any new Hub with Product and the required Buffer Inventory within [*] ([*]) days of the Parties  agreement to stock a Hub.  As a result of stocking Buffer Inventory, Product lead times will be reduced and may be less than [*] ([*]) calendar days.  Supplier may invoice for and ship to Insulet any Product that remains in the Hub longer than [*] ([*]) days, provided that Supplier has not stocked the Hub with more than the agreed-upon target level of Buffer Inventory for such Hub. 
  Insulet may draw any or all of the Buffer Inventory from a Hub at any time, upon notice to Supplier, and Supplier will deliver Product to Insulet from the Buffer Inventory.  When Insulet draws down on the Buffer Inventory, Supplier shall have [*] ([*]) days to replenish the Buffer Inventory to the thirty (30) day level. 
           f. 
    Invoices  .  Invoices for purchases will be issued to and payable by the Insulet business unit, affiliate or subsidiary that placed the order for the purchases.  Similarly, any applicable cancellation charges under Sections 15 or 16 below or materials or components charges under Section 8 below will be payable by the Insulet business unit, affiliate or subsidiary that cancelled the order or for whom the materials or components were

acquired.  Payment terms will be [*] ([*]%)/[*] ([*]), net [*] ([*]) days from receipt of invoice. 
  In the event of a dispute between the parties regarding any invoice, the parties will in good faith attempt to work out an amicable resolution.  Upon written request of either party, the business contact of each Party shall promptly confer and exert their commercially reasonable efforts without the necessity of any formal proceeding related thereto to reach a reasonable and equitable resolution of a dispute under this Agreement.  If such business contacts of each party are unable to resolve the dispute within ten (10) business days, the dispute shall be referred to the responsible senior management of each party for resolution.  Neither party shall seek any other means of resolving any dispute arising in connection with this Agreement until both parties  responsible senior managements have had at least ten (10) business days to resolve the dispute following its referral to them.  In the event that the parties are unable to resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of both parties, then either party shall pursue further remedies under this Agreement.  
           7. 
    Supply Chain Profiles.    Insulet shall provide to Supplier and maintain a list of approved materials suppliers (the    Approved Supplier List    or    ASL   ).  Supplier agrees to only purchase the materials required to manufacture the Product from suppliers on the then current ASL.  Supplier shall prepare supply chain profiles providing the categories of information indicated in   Exhibit C   which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference (each, a    Supply Chain Profile    and collectively, the    Supply Chain Profiles   ) for all materials and components used to produce the Products.   
     Supplier will provide the Supply Chain Profiles to Insulet by close of business on the first (1   st   ) Friday of each calendar quarter.  The Supply Chain Profiles will state the specific information set forth in   Exhibit C  , by material or component type, per bill of material, for each Product.  During the Parties  review of the Supply Chain Profiles, Supplier shall communicate (a) Insulet s total potential financial responsibility, by material or component type, calculated in accordance with Section 8 below, (b) known supply chain risks and an analysis and mitigation plan, and (c) any localization, alternate sourcing or value engineering opportunities.  Other than as set forth in Section 15 (Cancellation for Convenience) and Section 16 (Cancellation for Cause), Insulet shall be financially responsible for materials or components in accordance with the mutually agreed-upon Supply Chain Profiles and in accordance with Section 8 below. 
           8. 
    Insulet Responsibility for Obsolete and Aged Items of Component and Materials.     
     Insulet expects that Supplier will order sufficient materials and components to meet Insulet s requirements under this Agreement, including, without limitation, all Scheduled Deliveries that Insulet submits in accordance with Section 6(a) above, as increased or decreased by Insulet within the permitted changes allowed under the Flexibility Table referenced in Section 6(c) without any expedited cost or expense.  Insulet recognizes that Supplier may need to order components and materials to cover future needs for production of Products based on the Delivery Schedule, the Flexibility Table, the minimum package quantities (   MPQs   ), the volume pricing quantities (   VPQs   ), and/or the lead times identified in the mutually agreed-upon Supply Chain Profile (per Section 7 above).

Therefore, in the following circumstances, Insulet will have responsibility to purchase excess or obsolete components or materials from Supplier but only to the extent provided in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 15(a) below (regardless of whether a cancellation for convenience has occurred): 
           a. 
    If Insulet discontinues the purchase of the Products for which such components or materials were purchased or modifies a Product to eliminate the use of a particular component or material, and such components or materials cannot be used within the next [*] ([*]) months in other Products that Supplier is manufacturing for Insulet (   Obsolete Items   ), then Insulet s responsibility applies to all such items in Supplier s inventory that Supplier was authorized to purchase in accordance with the MPQs, VPQs, and lead times identified in the applicable Supply Chain Profile or, in the case that a component or material was not required to be included in the Supply Chain Profiles per Section 7, then the actual MPQs, VPQs, and lead times for such component shall apply; or 
              b. 
    In the event that any material or component procured by Supplier that is not required to satisfy demand in the next [*] ([*]) days, such materials and components become    Excess Items   .  Insulet shall, upon written demand from Supplier, either: (i) provide Supplier with a Purchase Order for Products to consume Excess Items within [*] ([*]) days or a Purchase Order to purchase the Excess Items themselves, (ii) pay Supplier a cash deposit in the amount of the cost of the Excess Items which shall be reconciled by the Parties quarterly, or (iii) begin paying to Supplier monthly an inventory carrying charge of one and [*] percent ([*]%) of the cost of the Excess Items, plus applicable manufacturing overhead (   MOH   ). 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, any material or component procured by Supplier for an Insulet new product initiative shall be considered  NPI Items  up until IQ for Products built on substantially new manufacturing lines and first commercial build on existing manufacturing lines.  Regardless of [*], NPI Items shall not be [*];   provided  ,   however  , that any NPI Items [*] shall be [*].  Supplier hereby agrees to [*]. 
  For all Excess Items that Insulet purchases under this Section 8, Supplier shall [*], and Supplier shall [*].  For Obsolete Items that are purchased by Insulet, Insulet will provide direction to Supplier on the disposition of such items, the cost and manner of disposition shall be mutually agreed to by the Parties within [*] ([*]) days.  If an agreement on cost and manner of disposition is not reached within [*] ([*]) days, Supplier may dispose of the items in a commercially reasonable manner. 
  The monetary amount stated as Insulet s potential financial responsibility for materials and components, as indicated from time to time in the Supply Chain Profiles provided under Section 7 above, is prior to any potential reduction for restocking of material or components to Supplier s vendors or use of materials or components for other customers, it being agreed that prior to charging Insulet for materials or components in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, Supplier must use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Insulet s financial responsibility for materials and components by using the materials and components to satisfy other customers orders prior to attempting to return materials and components to the vendor.  Insulet s financial responsibility under this Section 8 shall not apply to materials or components that are otherwise covered under Section 15(a) below due to a Cancellation for Convenience, or that are otherwise covered under Section 16(b) below due to a Cancellation for Cause.

    Fill Rate  .  The dates for Scheduled Deliveries are the dates by which the material must meet Insulet s Fill Rate requirement.  Scheduled Deliveries, in the exact quantities scheduled, between the due date and up to [*] ([*]) Insulet manufacturing days early will be considered on-time.  For purposes of this Agreement,    Fill Rate    shall mean the Product being received by the appropriate carrier on the date specified by Insulet. 
     Insulet reserves the right to refuse delivery of excess quantities or of Products that exceed or do not meet Fill Rate requirements.  Supplier is responsible for the excess cost of premium freight over regular freight when shipping Products to meet Scheduled Deliveries to the extent that the delay in shipment was caused by Supplier.  For the avoidance of doubt Supplier shall not be responsible for delays caused solely by Insulet or a force majeure event.  
    
  With each delivery, Supplier will provide a packing list showing, for each Product shipped: the Insulet part number and revision level, the number of pieces shipped, the Scheduled Delivery date and quantity and the Purchase Order number(s).  The same information will be provided on invoices and in both machine readable and human readable format as agreed by the Parties. 
           10. 
    Quality; Acceptance; Test Data; Failure Analysis  .   
              a. 
    Acceptance criteria for Products is [*] percent ([*]%) conformance to the Specifications and to the requirements set forth in the Quality Agreement attached hereto as   Exhibit D   and incorporated herein by reference (the  Quality Agreement ).  Products may be returned within a reasonable time frame if non-conformance to the Specifications is discovered by Insulet at incoming inspection, source inspection, and/or on Insulet's shop floor (e.g., during Insulet's final test of the Insulet products which contain the Products supplied by Supplier).  An entire shipment may be rejected based on reasonable sampling by Insulet in light of the nature of the Product and nature of the non conformance.  Payment for Products does not constitute acceptance if a non conformance is subsequently discovered as provided above.  Within [*] ([*]) manufacturing days after Supplier receives notification of Product rejection by Insulet, Supplier shall issue a Returned Materials Authorization (   RMA   ) number to Insulet to facilitate return or disposition of the products.  Issuance of the RMA number is procedural only and is not an admission that the Products are nonconforming.  If the RMA number is not received in that time, Insulet may return the Products to Supplier without an RMA number. 
              b. 
    For purposes of this Agreement,    Epidemic Failure Event    shall mean the occurrence of the same failure resulting from a breach of the Product Warranty (excluding the [*] ([*]) month Product Warranty Period which is replaced by the [*] ([*]) month period in (ii) below) (i) attributable to the same root cause found in [*] percent ([*]%) or more of units of a particular Product,  shipped by Supplier during a consecutive [*] ([*]) month period where such failure is verified by Supplier and Insulet, or an independent third party determined by Insulet subject to Supplier s reasonable consent, such consent not unreasonably withheld; and (ii) occurring within [*] ([*]) months after the date of delivery of the Products.   
              c. 
    Upon occurrence of a suspected Epidemic Failure Event, Insulet shall promptly notify Supplier, and shall provide, if known and as may exist, a description of the failure, and the suspected lot numbers, serial numbers or other identifiers, and delivery dates, of the failed Products.  Insulet shall make available to Supplier, samples of the failed Products

for testing and analysis.  Upon receipt of Product from Insulet, Supplier shall promptly provide its preliminary findings regarding the cause of the failure.  The Parties shall cooperate and work together to determine root cause.  Thereafter, Supplier shall promptly provide the results of its root cause corrective analysis, and if it is determined to be an Epidemic Failure Event, its proposed plan for the identification of and the replacement of the affected Products, and such other appropriate information.  Supplier shall recommend a corrective action program which identifies the affected units for replacement, and which minimizes disruption to the end user.  Insulet and Supplier shall consider, evaluate and determine the corrective action program.  In the event the test equipment necessary to test and analyze the defective product is no longer in Supplier s possession due to a planned phase-out of such equipment, Insulet and Supplier shall identify an alternative method (including without limitation timing and cost elements) by which to test and analyze the Epidemic Failure Event to both Parties  satisfaction.  Upon occurrence of an Epidemic Failure Event, Supplier shall replace or, at Supplier s option, issue a credit or payment to Insulet in an amount equal to the cost to Insulet for replacement Products; (b) reimburse all direct, reasonable, and documented labor, equipment and processing costs incurred by Insulet solely as a result of the implementation of the corrective action program for such Epidemic Failure Event, including test procedures and the testing of Products subject to the total limitation of liability in Section 20(f) below; and (c) reimburse freight, transportation, expedited shipping costs, customs, duties, insurance, storage, handling and other shipping costs incurred by Insulet solely in connection with the replacement of the affected Products. 
           d. 
    Supplier agrees to execute and deliver, upon request from Insulet, Supplier's standard form of compliance certificate certifying Supplier's compliance with the requirements imposed by this Agreement and by applicable laws, regulations and industry standards and setting forth the country or countries of which the articles are a product.  This compliance certificate must identify the shipment by shipment date, part number, revision number, quantity, and lot or serial numbers, as applicable.  The compliance certificate must also set forth the country or countries of which the articles are a product. 
              11.

obtaining such regulatory registrations, clearances and approvals as are needed to permit such marketing and sale.  The relevant United States Food and Drug Administration (   FDA   ) reviewer guidance documents or relevant requirements of other regulatory bodies shall be considered for the purposes of determining what information is necessary.  
           b. 
    Where specific testing is required to comply with the laws governing such regulatory registrations, clearances, approvals and self-certifications, then Insulet shall be responsible for obtaining such testing except where Supplier specifically commits to undertake such testing.  Supplier agrees to assist Insulet in developing test protocols for the Insulet products that incorporate the Products and in answering questions from FDA and other regulatory authorities concerning Insulet s submissions, insofar as such questions relate to any of the Products.  Insulet is solely responsible for determining the intended use of the Products and for the validation of the Products and their respective Drawings and Specifications for such intended use. 
              c. 
    Insulet shall have the right to inspect Supplier s facilities, quality systems and records, and other documentation relating to Supplier s adherence and performance to the quality standards set forth herein, and to assure compliance, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, at least annually during the Term and more often as may reasonably be necessary or desirable to assure quality of the Products and to conduct QA audits. 
              d. 
    Supplier shall cooperate in assisting Insulet in such audits.  During any such audits, Insulet shall have full access to Supplier s facilities used for manufacturing, packaging, testing and storage of Product. 
              14. 
    Disaster Recovery  .  Supplier shall provide Insulet with a copy of Supplier's Disaster Recovery Plan (the    Plan   ) which states policies, procedures and arrangements which Supplier shall adhere to in order to forestall and mitigate some of the disruption and delay in delivery of Products that might otherwise result from force majeure events impacting Supplier or its key vendors such as natural disasters, strikes, government actions, and materials and utility shortages.  This Plan may include alternate manufacturing sites, maintaining some materials inventory at a different location, alternate subcontractor sources for materials or manufacturing, etc.  Supplier agrees to adhere to all provisions of such Plan during the Term of this Agreement and during any additional period as the Parties continue to do business together under Section 2 above.  Supplier understands that Supplier is a key vendor to Insulet and that disruption or delay in delivery of Products to Insulet can have serious impact on Insulet's ability to manufacture and deliver its own products to its customers. 
              15. 
    Cancellations for Convenience  .  At any time, Insulet may (i) terminate this Agreement and all Scheduled Deliveries for convenience upon at least [*] ([*]) days  prior written notice to Supplier or (ii) cancel any Scheduled Deliveries for Insulet s convenience upon at least [*] ([*]) days  prior written notice to Supplier (each a    Cancellation for Convenience    and together,    Cancellations for Convenience   ), and this Section 15 shall govern Insulet s financial obligation to Supplier for such Cancellations for Convenience.  Cancellations for Convenience are only cancellations of Scheduled Deliveries by Insulet beyond the quantity of cancellations/reductions allowed under the change provisions of Section 6(c) above, including the Flexibility Table. 
     If Insulet informs Supplier of Insulet s intent to make any Cancellations for Convenience, then, prior to Supplier cancelling the Scheduled Delivery, Supplier shall first inform Insulet of the charges that would be applied, in accordance with this Section 15, for such proposed cancellation.

that such charges are made in accordance with this Agreement, Supplier shall cancel such Scheduled Delivery and invoice Insulet immediately for such charge.  Invoices shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Insulet will pay Supplier the following amounts for such Cancellation for Convenience quantities and in the event of termination of the Agreement for convenience, depending on the Zone of the cancelled quantity (per the Flexibility Table in   Exhibit B  ): 
           a. 
    For materials or components allocable to cancelled quantities of Products in Zones for which the Flexibility Table shows a commitment for materials or components, the following amounts as applicable:  (i) the actual cost plus applicable MOH of materials and components obtained by Supplier for production of such cancelled quantities, but only for materials or components which Supplier cannot immediately and reasonably divert to other customers or uses, restock to the vendor, or sell at no loss, and provided that Insulet shall not be responsible for materials or components that Supplier has ordered in advance of need or in excess of need (excluding needs to cover the flexibility allowed under the Flexibility Table to make changes to the Scheduled Deliveries), based on the Delivery Schedule and the MPQs, VPQs, and lead times identified in the applicable Supply Chain Profiles; (ii) the restocking charges of Supplier's vendors for materials or components that are restocked to the vendor and cannot be diverted or sold as above (but not including restocking of items that were ordered in advance of need or in excess of need as described above); and (iii) order cancellation charges of Supplier's vendors for materials or components ordered which cannot be diverted as above (but not including cancellation charges for items that were ordered in advance of need or in excess of need as described above); and 
              b. 
    Documented WIP allocable to cancelled quantities of Products in Zones for which the Flexibility Table shows a commitment for WIP which cannot be diverted as above, not to exceed the aggregate price of such canceled Product quantities; and  
              c. 
    Insulet s purchase price (per this Agreement) for finished goods that are allocable to cancelled quantities of Products in Zones for which the Scheduled Delivery Change Table shows a commitment for finished goods and for finished goods in any Buffer Inventory remaining in any Hub, not to exceed the agreed upon maximum quantity of Buffer Inventory. 
     If Insulet informs Supplier of Insulet s intent to cancel any Scheduled Deliveries in Zones that show no commitment, per the Flexibility Table in   Exhibit B  , it is understood Insulet will incur no associated cancellation charges.  It is understood that certain Products being produced for Insulet are specific to Insulet and will not be useable for other customers, and that certain materials or components used to produce Products for Insulet may not be returnable to Supplier's vendors.  Any materials, components, WIP or Products for which Insulet is liable hereunder shall be provided to Insulet as a deliverable and Insulet will provide direction to Supplier on the disposition of such items.  Payment for such charges shall be as provided by the payment terms of the Agreement.

ii. 
    Supplier is reasonably placed on    Limited    status and fails to abide with reasonable provisions set forth by Insulet in writing to be granted    Approved    status within one calendar year;  
              iii. 
    Supplier fails to adhere to the Quality Agreement and such failure is not cured within [*] ([*]) days of written notice by Insulet; 
              iv. 
    Supplier has repeated failures to adhere to the Quality Agreement which in the aggregate are a material failure, even if one or more of such failures has previously been cured under Section 16(a)(iii) above; or 
              v. 
    Supplier breaches Section 21 below. 
     In the event of such default, Insulet reserves the right upon written notice to Supplier to terminate this Agreement and/or cancel any or all outstanding Scheduled Deliveries for all Products.  Any such cancellation will be considered cancellation for cause and Insulet will not be required to pay Supplier any amounts with respect to such canceled deliveries except for: (1) any amounts that might otherwise be owed; (2) the actual cost of components and materials ordered or held by Supplier in accordance with this Agreement, other than any components or materials involved in the default; and (3) conforming finished Products received by, or in transit to Insulet. 
    
           b. 
    By Supplier  .  Supplier may terminate this Agreement and any or all Scheduled Deliveries hereunder upon written notice to Insulet in the event that Insulet, (or in the case of a Scheduled Delivery requested by an affiliate, such affiliate), fails to pay any amounts when due (other than amounts which are disputed in good faith), and such failure is not cured within [*] ([*]) days after Supplier has notified Insulet in writing that such amounts are overdue and not paid and that Supplier intends to terminate this Agreement or certain Scheduled Deliveries if such amounts are not paid within the [*] ([*]) day cure period.

In respect of any requested Change, the Agreement price shall be increased or decreased by the amount agreed to in writing by Customer and Seller, and the Agreement schedule shall be extended or compressed by mutual agreement. Seller may decline any Change proposed by Customer, if Seller reasonably believes based on past experience and industry knowledge that the proposed Change will create a safety hazard if implemented.

           (c) 
    A Customer site acceptance test (   SAT   ) shall be performed at the Installation Site within   [*]   (  [*]  ) business days of the completion of installation of the Products at the Installation Site.

           (d) 
    Seller shall carry out such remedial work as is necessary to achieve a successful FAT and SAT   [*]  , provided that any additional changes requested by Customer beyond those set forth in the Specifications may require additional charges which shall be determined by mutual agreement by both parties and reflected in a change order executed by the parties in accordance with Section 8 (Changes).  Once remedial work is complete, the Products will be re-tested and this process shall continue until a successful FAT and SAT is achieved in accordance with this Section 10.   
       
           (e) 
    In the event Seller and Customer are unable to agree upon a Test Plan within the time period provided for in sub-section (a) above, the parties shall immediately escalate the issue within their organizations.

  Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Services and Deliverables in accordance with any schedule(s) set out in the accepted Purchase Order or as otherwise agreed upon in writing between the parties.
