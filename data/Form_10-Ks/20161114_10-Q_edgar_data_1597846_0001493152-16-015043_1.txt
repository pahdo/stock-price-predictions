NOTE
1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with both accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation
S-X. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although
Greenpro Capital Corp ( the Company  or  GRNQ ) believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make
the information not misleading.  

In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair presentation
of the financial information for the interim periods reported have been made. Results of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending December 31, 2016, or any period thereafter.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements and related notes included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $937,894 and incurred a net loss of 367,647 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through December 31, 2016 is dependent upon improving
the profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or
external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Company s obligations as they become due.  

These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the
amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE

the company. Loke Che Chan, Gilbert and Lee Chong Kuang are the sole shareholders of GSN.  

The
Company controls GSN through a series of contractual arrangements (the  VIE Agreements ) between GPHL and GSN. The
VIE agreements include (i) Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement, (ii) Loan Agreement, (iii) Share Pledge Agreement (iv) Power
of Attorney and (v) Exclusive Option Agreement with the shareholder of GSN.  

Set
forth below is a more detailed description of each of the VIE agreement.  

Exclusive
Business Cooperation Agreement: Pursuant to the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement, GPHL serves as the exclusive provider
of technical support, consulting services and management services to GSN. In consideration of such services, GSN has agreed to
pay a service fee to GPHL, which is based on the time of services rendered multiplied by the corresponding rate, plus amount of
the services fees or ratio decided by the board of directors of GPHL. The Agreement has a term of 10 years but maybe extended
by GPHL in its discretion.  

Loan
Agreement: Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, GPHL granted interest-free loans to the shareholders of the GSN for the sole purpose
of increasing the registered capital of the GSN. These loans are eliminated with the capital of GSN during consolidation.  

Share
Pledge Agreement: Pursuant to the Share Pledge Agreement, the shareholders of GSN pledged to GPHL a first security interest in
all of their equity interests in GSN to secure GSN s timely and complete payment and performance of its obligations under
the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement. During the term of the Share Pledge Agreement, the pledgors agreed, among other
things, not to transfer, place or permit the existence of any security interest or other encumbrance on their interest in GSN
without the prior written consent of GPHL. The pledge shall remain in effect until 10 years after the obligations under the principal
agreement will have been fulfilled. However, upon the full payment of the consulting and service fees under the Exclusive Business
Cooperation Agreement and upon the termination of GSN s obligations under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement,
the Share Pledge Agreement shall be terminated and GPHL shall terminate this agreement as soon as reasonably practicable.  

Power
of Attorney: Pursuant to  a Power of Attorney, each of Messrs. Lee and Loke, as the sole shareholders
of GSN, granted to the GPHL the right to (i) attend shareholder s meetings of GSN (ii) exercise all shareholder rights (including
voting rights) with respect to such equity interests in GSN and (iii) designate and appoint on behalf of such shareholders the
legal representative, directors, supervisors, and other senior management members of GSN. Each Power of Attorney is irrevocable
and is continuously valid from the date of execution of such Power of Attorney, so long as such persons remain shareholders of
GSN.   

Exclusive
Option Agreement: Pursuant to the Exclusive Option Agreement, the shareholders of GSN granted to the GPHL an irrevocable and exclusive
right and option to purchase all of their equity interests in GSN. The purchase price shall be equal to the capital paid in by
the shareholders, adjusted pro rata for the purchase of less than all of the equity interests. The Agreement is effective for
a term of 10 years, and may be renewed at GPHL s election.

NOTE
4   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as
described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.  

Basis
    of presentation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America ( US GAAP ).  

Basis
    of consolidation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and include the assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries and its VIE over which the Company exercises control and, when applicable, entities
for which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company records income attributable to non-controlling interest in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations for any non-owned portion of consolidated subsidiaries. Non-controlling interest is recorded within the
equity section but separate from GRNQ s equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

Use
    of estimates   

In
preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results
may differ from these estimates. The following are some of the areas requiring significant judgments and estimates: determinations
of the useful lives of assets, estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts, cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing
asset impairment tests of long-lived assets.  

Inventory
      finished property   

Inventory
  finished property represents a multi-unit property developed for resale on a unit by unit basis. Inventory is stated at
cost unless the inventory is determined to be impaired in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. The
cost of inventory   finished property includes the purchase price of property, legal fees, improvement costs to the building
structure, and other acquisition costs. Project wide costs such as land acquisition and certain development costs are allocated
to the specific units based upon their relative fair value before construction. All property is finished and ready for sale.  

Investment
    Property   

Investment
Property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational and after
taking into account their estimated residual values:

The
cost of leasehold land and buildings includes the purchase price of property, legal fees, and other acquisition costs.  

Depreciation
expense, classified as cost of rental, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $22,285 and $23,576, respectively.  

Plant

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of plant and equipment is the difference
between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the statement of operations.  

Depreciation
expense, classified as operating expenses, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $11,513 and $8,183, respectively.  

Intangible
    assets   

Intangible
assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets represented the registration costs of trade marks registered
in Hong Kong, the PRC, and Malaysia, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful life of ten years. Intangible
assets acquired in business combinations are provisionally considered customer lists amortized on a straight-line basis over a
useful life of five years.  

The
Company follows ASC Topic 350 in accounting for intangible assets, which requires impairment losses to be recorded when indicators
of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the assets 
carrying amounts. There were no impairment losses recorded on intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015.  

On
July 31, 2015, the Company entered into various Sale and Purchase Agreements with Falcon Corporate Services Limited(Formerly known
as Ace Corporate Services Limited), Falcon Secretaries Limited, Shenzhen Falcon Financial Consulting Limited and Yabez (Hong Kong)
Company Limited and the acquisition are closed on September 30, 2015.  

On
May 3, 2016, the Company completed the analysis to determine the fair value of customer relationships as of the acquisition date
and adjusted the cost and accumulative amortization of customer relationships. The cost of customer relationships was determined
at $624,500 as of the acquisition data with a corresponding increase to Goodwill. The Company valued customer relationships using
the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. In determining the fair value of the customer relationships,
the multi- period excess earnings approach values the intangible asset at the present value of the incremental after-tax cash
flows attributable only to the customer relationship. And the adjusted amortization reflected in the current-period income statement
that would have been recognized the adjustment to provisional amounts in previous period is amount of $3,521.  

Amortization
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $90,509 and $305, respectively.

advisor of the Company, which is stated at the cash surrender value of the contract.  

Variable
    Interest Entity   

A

accordance to ASC Topic 810  Consolidation , the Company it required to include in its consolidated financial statements,
the financial statement of its VIE. ASC 810 requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority
of the risk of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE s residual returns. VIEs are those entities
in which a company, through contractual agreements, bears the risk of, and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership
of the entity, and therefore the company is the primary beneficiary of the entity.  

Through
the VIE agreement disclosed in Note 3, the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of GSN. According, the result of GSN has
been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  

Investments
    in unconsolidated entities   

Under
the equity method of accounting, investments in unconsolidated entities are initially recognized in the consolidated balance sheet
at cost and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the Company s proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the entity,
distributions received, contributions and certain other adjustments, as appropriate. The Company s share of the income or
loss of the unconsolidated entity is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and will increase or decrease, as
applicable, the carrying value of the Company s investments in unconsolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheet.  

When
the investment cost in an unconsolidated entity is reduced to zero, the Company records no further losses in its consolidated
statements of operations unless the Company has an outstanding guarantee obligation or has committed additional funding to the
entity. When such entity subsequently reports income, the Company will not record its share of such income until it exceeds the
amount of the Company s share of losses not previously recognized.  

Comprehensive
    income   

Comprehensive
income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances
from non-owner sources. The Company s accumulated other comprehensive income consists of cumulative foreign currency translation
adjustments.  

Revenue
    recognition   

The
Company recognizes its revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , upon the delivery of
its products when: (1) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (2) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (3) there
are no continuing obligations to the customer; and (4) the collection of related accounts receivable is probable.  

(a)  
      Rental
    income   

Revenue
from rental of leasehold land and buildings are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is
reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased assets.  

The
Company leases its commercial office premises in Malaysia and Hong Kong under various non-cancelable operating leases with terms
of two to three years and renewal options. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has recorded $69,963 in rental
revenue, based upon its annual rental over the life of the lease under operating lease, using straight-line method.

Revenue
from the provision of (i) business consulting and advisory services and (ii) company secretarial, accounting and financial review
services are recognized when there is (i) an existence of contract or an arrangement (ii) services are rendered, (iii) the service
price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonable assured.  

(c)  
      Sale
    of properties   

Revenue
from the sale of properties is recognized at the time each unit is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer.
Specifically, the Company utilizes the full accrual method where recognition occurs when (i) the collectability of the sales price
is reasonably assured, (ii) the seller is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale, (iii) the initial investment
from the buyer is sufficient, and (iv) the Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring
control of a promised property to a customer.  

Revenue
on sales of properties may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for revenue recognition have been met.  

Cost
    of revenues   

Cost
of revenue on rental shown on the accompanying statements of operations include costs associated with government rent and rates,
repairs and maintenance, property insurance, depreciation and other related administrative costs. Property management fee and
utility expenses are paid directly by tenants.  

Costs
of revenue on provision of services primarily consist of employee compensation and related payroll benefits, company formation
cost and other professional fees directly attributable to cost in related to the services rendered.  

Cost
of revenues on sale of properties primary consist of the purchase price of property, legal fees, improvement costs to the building

    interest   

Non-controlling
interest represents the capital contribution, income and loss attributable to the shareholders of less than wholly-owned and consolidated
entities.  

Income
    taxes   

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740,   Income Taxes   ( ASC 740 ).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized
in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
facts.

Fair
    value of financial instruments   

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deposits, prepayments
and other receivables, accounts payable, receipts in advance, loan from shareholders, amounts due to directors, amount due to
related companies, amount due to non-controlling interest party, and other payables and accrued liabilities approximate at their
fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  

The
Company follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC
820-10 ), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level
    1  : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;    

Level
    2  : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and    

Level
    3  : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its
    own assumptions    

As
of September 30, 2016, there is no any financial instrument required to be measured at fair value.  

Recent
    accounting pronouncements   

In
September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments
( ASU 2015-16 ), which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period
adjustments following a business combination. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment
(including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. ASU 2015-16
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. This guidance is
effective for us for the period ended September 30, 2016.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
Cash Payments. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. The
issues identified within the ASU include: debt prepayments or extinguishment costs; contingent consideration made after a business
combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance
policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests
in securitization transactions; and separately identified cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15
is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim reporting periods. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to
have a material effect on our statement of cash flows.

For

(b)  
      Major
    vendors   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there was no vendor who accounted for 10% or more of the Company s cost
of revenues with no accounts payable balance at year-end.  

(c)  
      Credit
    risk   

Financial
instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes the concentration
of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short
collection terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance
for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.  

(d)  
      Interest
    rate risk   

As
the Company has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Company s income and operating cash flows are substantially
independent of changes in market interest rates. The Company s interest-rate risk arises from bank loans. The Company manages
interest rate risk by varying the issuance and maturity dates variable rate debt, limiting the amount of variable rate debt, and
continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates.  

(e)  
      Exchange
    rate risk   

The
reporting currency of the Company is US$, to date the majority of the revenues and costs are denominated in MYR and RMB and a
significant portion of the assets and liabilities are denominated in MYR and RMB. As a result, the Company is exposed to foreign
exchange risk as its revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between US$, MYR
and RMB. If MYR and RMB depreciates against US$, the value of MYR and RMB revenues and assets as expressed in US$ financial statements
will decline. The Company does not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose it to substantial market risk.

To
support our venture capital business, we partnered with QSC Asia Sdn. Bhd., an education and training company that arranges seminars
and courses in Malaysia, to provide business and educational and support services. Specifically, we hope to arrange one or more
seminars called the CEO   Business Owners Strategic Session (CBOSS) for business owners who are interested in the following:

    the business globally   

Expanding
                                         business with increase capital funds

                                         company cash flow significantly    

The
objective of the CBOSS seminar will be to educate the Chief Executive Officer or business owner on how to acquire  smart
capital  and the considerations involved. We expect the seminar to include an introduction to the basic concepts of  smart
capital,   wealth and value creation,  recommendation and planning and similar topics. We believe that the seminar
will synergistically support our venture capital business segment.

at such time as we sell our interest in our portfolio companies. We hope to commence our education and training seminars at the
end of 2016.  

Cost
of Revenues . Total cost of revenues was $779,187 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared $865,171
for the for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the attributable to the increase in services
rendered from our service business segment. Cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue was approximately 45% as of September
30, 2016, with our rental and services business segments accounting for approximately 5% and 95% of the cost of revenue.  

Cost
of rental and properties . Cost of revenue from our real estate business segment was $37,221 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, and consisted solely of costs associated with rental income. Cost of revenue from our real estate business segment for
the same period ended September 30, 2015, was $476,552 and consisted of costs associated with rental income of $5,783 and real
estate sales of $470,769. Cost of revenue includes the costs associated with government rent and rates, repairs and maintenance,
property insurance, and other related administrative costs.  

Cost

ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $388,619 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increases in cost of services
is due to increase in services provided. Cost of service primarily consisted of employee compensation and related payroll benefits,
company formation cost and other professional fees.

September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $887,709 (51% margin) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
of gross profit is due to no cost of properties sold.

as compared to $802,356 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was
primarily due to the increase in directors  remuneration and quarter, office rent, professional and legal fees.

the net loss of $81,363 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net loss is due to business expense increases
arising from the broadening of our business services and expansion of our client base.

have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

We
conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term
 disclosure controls and procedures , as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of September 30, 2016, that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses
under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: ( 1) ineffective controls
over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes; and (2) lack of internal audit function due to the fact that the
Company lacks qualified resources to perform the internal audit functions properly and that the scope and effectiveness of the
internal audit function are yet to be developed. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Financial
Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of September 30, 2016.   

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (1) and (2) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However,
management believes that the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight
in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement
in our financial statements in future periods.  

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management s
review and approval of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures
that:  

1.
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of our assets;  

2.
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management;
and  

3.
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, using the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing
of the operational effectiveness of these controls.  

Based
on this assessment, management has concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was
not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In an effort to remediate the
identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate,
the following series of measures:  

We
have increased our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function, however, we should continue
to hire two or more personnel for the function. We will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives.
And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting
in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available
to us. We also plan to prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process
to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions, including equity and debt transactions.  

We
anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2016. Additionally,
we plan to test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies in year 2016.  

This
quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public
accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only
management s report in this annual report.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting     

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
