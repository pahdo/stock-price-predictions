Note
1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Nature
of Business -  Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the  Company  or  Actinium ) is a biotechnology company
committed to developing breakthrough therapies for life threatening diseases using its alpha particle immunotherapy ( APIT )
platform and other related and similar technologies. Actinium, together with its wholly owned subsidiary, MedActinium, Inc., is
hereinafter referred to collectively as  Actinium  or the  Company . The Company s most advanced
products are Actimab -A, an antibody-drug construct containing actinium 225 (Ac-225), currently in human clinical trials
for acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) and Iomab -B, an antibody-drug construct containing iodine 131 ( I-131 ),
used in myeloconditioning for hematopoietic stem cells transplantation ( HSCT ) in various indications. The Company
initiated the pivotal Phase 3 trial of Iomab -B for bone marrow conditioning for HSCT in relapsed and refractory AML patient s
age of 55 and older, which upon successful completion of our clinical trials we intend to submit for marketing approval. Actinium
is also considering filing an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for breakthrough therapy
designation for Actimab -A and/or Iomab -B. The Company is developing its cancer drugs using its expertise in radioimmunotherapy.
In addition, the Company s Ac-225 based drug development relies on the patented APIT platform technology co-developed with
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center ( MSKCC ), a significant stockholder in the Company. The APIT technology couples
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with extremely potent but comparatively safe alpha particle emitting radioactive isotopes, in particular
actinium 225 and bismuth 213. The final drug construct is designed to specifically target and kill cancer cells while minimizing
side effects. Actinium intends to develop a number of products for different types of cancer and derive revenue from partnering
relationships with large pharmaceutical companies and/or direct sales of its products in specialty markets in the United States.  

On
December 16, 2015, the Company announced that the FDA cleared the Company's IND filing for Iomab-B, and that it will proceed
with the pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trial. In June 2016, Actinium announced the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for Iomab-B was
initiated and assuming that the trial meets its end points, it will form the basis for a Biologics Licensing Application
(BLA) with the FDA. The Company, in its recently approved IND filing, established an agreement with the FDA that the path to a Biologics
License Application submission would include a single, pivotal Phase 3 clinical study if it is successful. The population in
this two arm, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial will be refractory and relapsed AML patients over the age of 55. The
trial size was set at 150 patients with 75 patients per arm. The primary endpoint in the pivotal Phase 3 trial is durable
complete remission, defined as a complete remission lasting at least 6 months and a secondary endpoint that will be overall
survival at one year. There are currently no effective treatments approved by the FDA for AML in this patient population and
there is no defined standard of care. Iomab-B has completed several physicians sponsored clinical trials examining its
potential as a conditioning regimen prior to HSCT in various blood cancers, including the Phase 1/2 study in relapsed and/or
refractory AML patients. The results of these studies in almost 300 patients have demonstrated the potential for Iomab-B to
create a new treatment paradigm for bone marrow transplants by: expanding the pool to ineligible patients who do not have any
viable treatment options currently; enabling a shorter and safer preparatory interval for HSCT; reducing post-transplant
complications; and showing a clear survival benefit including curative potential.  

On September 27, 2016,
we announced that we initiated the Phase 2 clinical trial for Actimab-A. This Phase 2 clinical trial is a multicenter, open-label
study that will enroll 53 patients. Patients will receive 2.0  Ci/kg/fractionated dose of Actimab-A via two injections given
at day 1 and day 7. The Phase 2 trial is designed to evaluate complete response rates at up to day 42 after Actimab-A administration,
where complete response is defined as complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). A
formal interim analysis is expected to occur in mid-2017 with topline results expected in the second half of 2017. The Phase 2
trial will include peripheral blast burden as an inclusion criteria and in patients with high peripheral blast (PB) burden, the
use of Hydroxyurea will be mandated with the goal of bringing PB burden below a key threshold number that we have identified from
two previously complete Phase 1 clinical trials totaling 38 patients. In addition, the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors
(GCSF) will be mandated. Low dose cytarabine has been eliminated from the protocol and the Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate
Actimab-A as a monotherapy. The secondary endpoint of the Phase 2 trial will be overall survival.  

Basis
of Presentation - Unaudited Interim Financial Information    The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) with respect to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments)
which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. These unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and notes thereto contained in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 11, 2016.  

Principles
of Consolidation -  The consolidated financial statements include the Company s accounts and those of the Company s
wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  

Use
of Estimates in Financial Statement Presentation -  The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents -  The Company considers all highly liquid accounts with original maturities of three months or less to
be cash equivalents. Balances held by the Company are typically in excess of FDIC insured limits. At September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, all of the Company s cash was deposited in one bank.   

Property
and Equipment -  Machinery and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful
lives of three years. Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful
lives of three years. When assets are retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts,
and any related gain or loss is reflected in operations. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to operations.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets -  Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable or at a minimum annually during the fourth quarter of the year. If an
evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s
carrying value to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary. The effect of any impairment would be to expense the
difference between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value.  

Derivatives
-  All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. Where market prices are not readily available, fair
values are determined using market based pricing models incorporating readily observable market data and requiring judgment and
estimates.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments -  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid
to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established for
valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:  

Level
1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability
to access at the measurement date.  

Level
2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices
for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived
principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means.  

Level
3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity's own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.  

The
following tables set forth assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. As required by ASC 820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ,
financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement
requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value
hierarchy levels.  

Income
Taxes -  The Company uses the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. The Company reviews deferred tax assets for a valuation allowance based upon whether it is more likely than not that
the deferred tax asset will be fully realized. A valuation allowance, if necessary, is provided against deferred tax assets, based
upon management s assessment as to their realization.  

Research
and Development Costs -  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development reimbursements and
grants are recorded by the Company as a reduction of research and development costs.   

Share-Based
Payments -  The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The fair value determined represents the cost for the award and is recognized over the vesting period during which
an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. As share-based compensation expense is recognized based
on awards ultimately expected to vest, the Company reduces the expense for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture
rates. Previously recognized compensation costs may be adjusted to reflect the actual forfeiture rate for the entire award at
the end of the vesting period. Excess tax benefits, if any, are recognized as an addition to paid-in capital.   

Earnings (Loss) Per Common
Share  - The Company calculates net earnings (loss) per common share in accordance with ASC 260  Earnings Per Share 
( ASC 260 ). Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s potentially dilutive shares, which include outstanding common stock options and
warrants have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per share as the result would have been anti-dilutive. 

Subsequent Events  -
The Company s management reviewed all material events through the date of the consolidated financial statements were issued
for subsequent event disclosure consideration. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    In April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  (topic 718). The FASB issued
this update to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment
awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including:
(a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement
of cash flows. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new
standard.  

In
February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02  Leases  (topic 842), which creates new accounting and reporting guidelines
for leasing arrangements. The new guidance requires organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities on the
balance sheet related to the rights and obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they are classified as finance
or operating leases. Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows
arising from a lease primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The guidance also requires new
disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from
leases. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods
within that reporting period, with early application permitted. The new standard is to be applied using a modified retrospective
approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material
effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  

Note
2 - Related Party Transactions   

MSKCC:    

On
February 11, 2002, the Company entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with Sloan-Kettering Institute
of Cancer Research ( SKI ), an entity related to MSKCC, a majority shareholder of the Company. The agreement
was amended in August 2006. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company licensed certain intellectual property from SKI, including
critical patents with respect to the Company s core technology that also supports ongoing research and clinical development
of related drug candidates. MSKCC agreed, subject to certain conditions, to utilize the funds paid for certain clinical and preclinical
programs and activities related to the Company s drug development and clinical study programs, including the payment of
certain costs and expenses that would otherwise have been borne by the Company.  

The
Company is obligated to make the following milestone payments:  

Milestones    
     Payments     

(1) filing of an New Drug Application ( NDA ) or regulatory approval for each licensed product    
     $  750,000     
 
     (2) upon the receipt of regulatory approval from the U.S. FDA for each licensed product    
        1,750,000     

Under
the agreement, the Company shall pay to MSKCC on a country-by-country basis a royalty of 2% of net sales of all licensed products
until the later of: (1) 10 years from the first commercial sale, or (2) when the patents expire.  

For each of the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for maintenance fees and research
conducted by MSKCC. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $0 was due to MSKCC.    

On December 21, 2015, Actinium
entered into an investor rights agreement with MSKCC. Under the terms of the agreement, MSKCC has agreed to forebear from transferring
or otherwise disposing of its approximately 5.7 million shares of the Company s common stock (other than pursuant to a piggyback
registration as described below) until the start of the Actimab-A Phase 2 clinical study. The Company started the Actimab-A Phase
2 clinical study in September 2016. Thereafter MSKCC is permitted to sell its shares subject to a weekly volume limitation of 150,000
shares (which limit may be increased to up to 250,000 shares per week to the extent any prior weekly allotments are not fully used)
and applicable law so long as MSKCC maintains at least 25% of its current shareholding in Actinium through December 31, 2016.
Actinium has granted MSKCC piggyback registration rights that would be triggered in the event Actinium were to engage in a public
registered offering of its shares for its own account where other shareholders are participating as selling shareholders or where
such public registered offering is for the account of other selling shareholders. In addition, Actinium granted MSKCC unlimited
Form S-3 registration rights with respect to its shares following December 31, 2016.  

Placement
Agent:     

On
December 9, 2013, the Company entered into an engagement agreement with a Healthcare Investment Bank ( Placement Agent )
as its placement agent for the 2013 Common Stock Offering whereby a director of the Company was the former Head of its Healthcare
Investment Banking team ( the 2013 Offering ). The 2013 Offering was completed in two tranches, December 9, 2013 and
January 10, 2014. The agreement entered in on December 9, 2013 included a cash fee equal to 10% of the gross proceeds raised,
a non-accountable expense reimbursement equal to 2% of the gross proceeds raised and warrants to purchase shares of the Company s
Common Stock in an amount equal to 10% of the shares of common stock issued or issuable. Subsequent to the closing of the 2013
Offering, the placement agent continued to provide certain financial advisory services to the Company until six months after the
Company had up-listed its securities for trading on a U.S. National Exchange for a monthly fee of $25,000. On May 28, 2014,
the Company and the placement agent agreed to terminate the December 9, 2013 engagement agreement. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company owed its placement agent $25,000.   

On
February 11, 2015, the Company completed a public offering that totaled 4,444,444 common shares, representing gross proceeds of
approximately $20.0 million and a net amount of approximately $18.5 million after deducting the underwriting discount and the
other offering expenses. The Placement Agent acted as the sole book-running manager for the offering. The offering was made pursuant
to a shelf registration statement previously filed with and declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The placement agent received a cash fee of approximately $1.4 million.   

On
June 9, 2015, the Company completed a registered direct offering of $5.0 million of its common stock. Under the terms of the subscription
agreements, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,923,078 shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $2.60 per
share. The Placement Agent acted as the sole placement agent with respect to the offering. The Placement Agent received a cash
fee of approximately $0.4 million.

and equipment consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Depreciation
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $20,078 and $16,820, respectively. Depreciation expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $57,670 and $43,409, respectively.  

Note
5 - Note Payable   

On
December 28, 2015, the Company entered into a premium finance agreement for its director and officer liability insurance policy
in the amount of $0.3 million. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company was required to pay $30,077 in monthly installments for
nine months.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance related to the premium finance agreement was $0 and $0.3
million, respectively.  

Note
6 - Derivatives   

The
Company has determined that certain warrants the Company has issued contain provisions that protect holders from future issuances
of the Company s common stock at prices below such warrants  respective exercise prices and these provisions could
result in modification of the warrants  exercise price based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a  fixed-for-fixed 
option as defined under FASB ASC Topic No. 815 - 40. The warrants granted in connection with the issuance of the 2012 Common Stock
Offering, and the placement agent warrants contain anti-dilution provisions that provide for a reduction in the exercise price
of such warrants in the event that future common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) is issued
(or becomes contractually issuable) at a price per share (a  Lower Price ) that is less than the exercise price of
such warrant at the time. The amount of any such adjustment is determined in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement
and depends upon the number of shares of common stock issued (or deemed issued) at the Lower Price and the extent to which the
Lower Price is less than the exercise price of the warrant at the time.  

Activities
for derivative warrant instruments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 183,718 warrants were exercised, of which 12,109 were derivative warrants. The fair
value of these derivative warrants totaling $17,455 were measured on the exercise date and reclassified to additional paid-in
capital.  

The
fair values of the derivative warrants were calculated using a modified binomial valuation model with the following assumptions
at each balance sheet date.   

(1)  
      The
    market value of common stock at the above measurement dates is based on the Company s closing price quoted on the NYSE
    MKT.   

(2)  
      The
    risk-free interest rate was determined by management using the Treasury Bill rate as of the respective measurement date.   

(3)  
      As
    of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the volatility was estimated using the historical volatilities of the Company s
    common stock traded in NYSE MKT market.    

(4)  
      Management
    determined the dividend yield to be 0% based upon its expectation that it will not pay dividends for the foreseeable future.   

(5)  
      Management
    determines the probability of future stock offering at each evaluation date.   

(6)  
      Represents
    the estimated offering price in future offerings as determined by management.

Description
of Business   

Actinium
is a biotechnology company committed to developing breakthrough therapies for life threatening diseases using its alpha particle
immunotherapy (APIT) platform and other related and similar technologies. Our most advanced products are Actimab -A, an
antibody-drug construct containing actinium 225 (Ac-225), currently in human clinical trials for acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
and Iomab -B, an antibody-drug construct containing iodine 131 (I-131), used in myeloconditioning for hematopoietic stem
cells transplantation (HSCT) in various indications. We initiated the pivotal Phase 3 trial of Iomab -B for bone marrow
conditioning for HSCT in relapsed and refractory AML patients  age of 55 and older, which upon successful completion of
our clinical trials we intend to submit for marketing approval. We are currently also considering filing an application with the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for breakthrough therapy designation for Actimab -A and/or Iomab -B. We are
developing our cancer drugs using our expertise in radioimmunotherapy. In addition, our Ac-225 based drug development relies on
the patented Alpha Particle Immunotherapy Technology (APIT) platform technology co-developed with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (MSKCC), a significant stockholder in our company. The APIT technology couples monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with extremely
potent but comparatively safe alpha particle emitting radioactive isotopes, in particular actinium 225 and bismuth 213. The final
drug construct is designed to specifically target and kill cancer cells while minimizing side effects. We intend to develop a
number of products for different types of cancer and derive revenue from partnering relationships with large pharmaceutical companies
and/or direct sales of its products in specialty markets in the United States.  

On
December 16, 2015, we announced that the FDA cleared our IND filing for Iomab-B, and that it will proceed with the pivotal, Phase
3 clinical trial. In June 2016, we announced the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for Iomab-B was initiated and assuming that the
trial meets its end points, it will form the basis for a Biologics Licensing Application (BLA). We, established an agreement with
the FDA that the path to a Biologics License Application submission would include a single, pivotal Phase 3 clinical study if
it is successful. The population in this two arm, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial will be refractory and relapsed AML
patients over the age of 55. The trial size was set at 150 patients with 75 patients per arm. The primary endpoint in the pivotal
Phase 3 trial is durable complete remission, defined as a complete remission lasting at least 6 months and the secondary endpoint
will be overall survival at one year. There are currently no effective treatments approved by the FDA for AML in this patient
population and there is no defined standard of care. Iomab-B has completed several physicians sponsored clinical trials examining
its potential as a conditioning regimen prior to HSCT in various blood cancers, including the Phase 1/2 study in relapsed and/or
refractory AML patients. The results of these studies in over 300 patients have demonstrated the potential of Iomab-B to create
a new treatment paradigm for bone marrow transplants by: expanding the pool to ineligible patients who do not have any viable
treatment options currently; enabling a shorter and safer preparatory interval for HSCT; reducing post-transplant complications;
and showing a clear survival benefit including curative potential.  

On September 27,
2016, we initiated the Phase 2 clinical trial for Actimab-A. This Phase 2 clinical trial is a multicenter, open-label study that
will enroll 53 patients. Patients will receive 2.0  Ci/kg/fractionated dose of Actimab-A via two injections given at day
1 and day 7. The Phase 2 trial is designed to evaluate complete response rates at up to day 42 after Actimab-A administration,
where complete response is defined as complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). A
formal interim analysis is expected to occur in mid-2017 with topline results expected in the second half of 2017. The Phase 2
trial will include peripheral blast burden as an inclusion criteria and in patients with high peripheral blast (PB) burden, the
use of Hydroxyurea will be mandated with the goal of bringing PB burden below a key threshold number that we have identified from
two previously complete Phase 1 clinical trials totaling 38 patients. In addition, the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors
(GCSF) will be mandated. Low dose cytarabine has been eliminated from the protocol and the Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate
Actimab-A as a monotherapy. The secondary endpoint of the Phase 2 trial will be overall survival. 

Plan
of Operation   

We
develop drugs for the treatment of cancer with the intent to cure or significantly improve survival of the affected
patients. As of now none of our drugs have been approved for sale in the United States or elsewhere. We have no commercial
operations in sales or marketing of our products. All our product candidates are under development. In order to market and
sell our products we must conduct clinical trials on patients and obtain regulatory approvals from appropriate regulatory
agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and similar agencies elsewhere in the
world.  

Our
products under development are monoclonal antibodies labeled with radioisotopes. We have one program with an antibody labeled
with a beta emitter and several programs based on a proprietary patent protected platform technology called APIT. Our APIT technology
is based on attaching actinium 225 (Ac-225) or bismuth 213 (Bi-213) alpha emitting radioisotopes to monoclonal antibodies. Alpha
emitting radioisotopes are unstable chemical elements that decay by releasing alpha particles. Alpha particles can kill any cell
in the immediate proximity of where they are released. Monoclonal antibodies are genetically engineered proteins that specifically
target certain cells, including cancer cells. It is crucial for the success of our drug candidates to contain monoclonal antibodies
that can successfully seek cancer cells and can kill them with the attached isotope while not harming nearby normal cells. We
do not have technology and operational capabilities to develop and manufacture such monoclonal antibodies and we therefore rely
on collaboration with third parties to gain access to such monoclonal antibodies. We have secured rights to two monoclonal antibodies,
HuM195 (Lintuzumab), in 2003 through a collaborative licensing agreement with Abbvie Biotherapeutics Corp and BC8 in 2012 with
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ( FHCRC ). We expect to negotiate collaborative agreements with other potential
partners that would provide us with access to additional monoclonal antibodies. Establishing and maintaining such collaborative
agreements is a key to our success as a company.  

Under
our own sponsorship as well as activity at FHCRC, we have four product candidates in active clinical trials: Actimab-A (HuM195-Ac-225),
Iomab-B (BC8-I-131), BC8-Y-90 and BC8-SA. At this time, the Company is actively pursuing development of Actimab-A and Iomab-B
while BC8-Y-90 and BC8-SA are in physician sponsored clinical phase 1 trials at the FHCRC. Actimab-A is a combination of the monoclonal
antibody we have in-licensed, Lintuzumab (HuM195), and the alpha emitting isotope actinium 225. Actimab-A has shown promising
results throughout preclinical development and an ongoing clinical trial started in 2006 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the
elderly. We have expanded the number of patients and number of clinical centers by commencing a new AML clinical trial which we
have launched in 2012. This trial targets newly diagnosed AML patients over the age of 60. In order to conduct the trial we are
engaged in funding, monitoring and quality assurance and control of the Lintuzumab antibody; procurement of actinium 225 isotope;
funding, monitoring and quality assurance and control of the drug candidate Actimab-A manufacturing and organizing and monitoring
clinical trials. We estimate that the direct costs to completion of the ongoing Phase 2 trial will be  approximately
$7 million.  Iomab-B is a combination of the in-licensed monoclonal antibody BC8 and the beta emitting radioisotope iodine
131. This construct has been extensively tested in Phase I and Phase 2 clinical trials in approximately 250 patients with different
blood cancer indications who were in need of a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Iomab-B is used to condition the
bone marrow of these patients by destroying blood cancer cells in their bone marrow and elsewhere thus allowing for a subsequent
transplant containing healthy donor bone marrow stem cells. We have decided to develop this drug candidate by initially focusing
on the patients over 55 with active acute myeloid leukemia in relapse and/or refractory to existing treatments. We received clearance
our IND for Iomab-B in December 2015 and initiated the pivotal Phase 3 trial in June 2016. We estimate the direct costs of such
a trial to completion anticipated in 2018 will be approximately $25-30 million.  

We
have primarily management position employees and consultants who direct, organize and monitor the activities described above through
contractors. Much of the in-vivo laboratory and clinical work contracted for by the Company was conducted at MSKCC in New York.
We also made clinical trial arrangements with other well-known cancer centers. Our Actimab-A drug candidate and its components
are contract manufactured and maintained under our supervision by specialized contract manufacturers and suppliers in the United
States, including IsoTex Diagnostics, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pacific GMP, Fischer Bioservices, and BioReliance.  

We have never generated
revenue. Currently, we do not have a recurring source of revenues to cover our operating costs. We incurred a net loss for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of approximately $6.6 million and $3.9 million, respectively. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred a net loss of approximately $17.6 million and $14.5 million, respectively. We believe
that we have sufficient cash on hand to fund our operations through the next 12 months.  

Opportunities,
Challenges and Risks   

The
market for drugs for cancer treatment is a large market in need of novel products, in which successful products can command multibillion
dollars in annual sales. A number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies regularly acquire products in development,
with preference given to products in Phase 2 or later clinical trials. These deals are typically structured to include an upfront
payment that ranges from several million dollars to tens of million dollars or more and additional milestone payments tied to
regulatory submissions and approvals and sales milestones. Our goal is to develop our product candidates through Phase 2 clinical
trials and enter into partnership agreements with one or more large pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology companies.  

We believe our future success
will be heavily dependent upon our ability to successfully conduct clinical trials and preclinical development of our drug candidates.
This will in turn depend on our ability to continue our collaboration with MSKCC and our Clinical Advisory Board members. In addition,
we plan to continue and expand other research and clinical trial collaborations. Moreover, we will have to maintain sufficient
supply of actinium 225 and successfully maintain and if and when needed replenish or obtain our reserves of monoclonal antibodies.
We will have to maintain and improve manufacturing procedures we have developed for production of our drug candidates from the
components that include the iodine 131 and actinium 225 isotopes, monoclonal antibodies and other materials. It is possible that
despite our best efforts our clinical trials results may not meet regulatory requirements for approval. If our efforts are successful,
we will be able to partner our development stage products on commercially favorable terms only if they enjoy appropriate patent
coverage and/or considerable know-how and other protection that ensures market exclusivity. For that reason, we intend to continue
our efforts to maintain existing and generate new intellectual property. Intellectual property is a key factor in the success of
our business as well as market exclusivity. 

To achieve the goals discussed
above we intend to continue to invest in research and development at high and constantly increasing rates thus incurring further
losses until one or more of our products are sufficiently developed to partner them to large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. 

Results of Operations   Three Months
Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

The following table sets
forth, for the periods indicated, data derived from our statements of operations: 

Revenues  

We recorded no commercial
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Research and Development Expense  

Research and development
expenses increased by approximately $2.9 million to $5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.8 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Actimab -A costs increased by approximately $2.3 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the third quarter of 2016, we incurred
significant amount of start-up costs for the Phase 2 trial for Actimab -A and expensed closing costs associated with the
Phase 1 trial of Actimab -A. Iomab-B costs increased by about $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 mostly from the clinical research organization conducting the Phase 3
portion of the trial. We expect to incur increased research and development costs in the future.  

General and Administrative Expenses   

Overall, total general
and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $0.4 million from approximately $1.8 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015 to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was largely attributable to decrease
in stock compensation costs of $0.5 million and other related expenses and professional services. We expect to incur increased
general and administrative costs in the future. 

Other Income (Expense)  

Other income for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The other income is mainly
associated with changes in our warrant derivative liability. Due to the $10 million financing that was completed in October 2016
with an offering price of $1.25 per share caused the derivative warrants to be repriced at $2.34 per share from $2.48 per share.
In addition, the change is also attributable to the fluctuation of our stock price from $1.77 per share at September 30, 2015 to
$1.35 per share at September 30, 2016.  

Net Loss  

Our net loss increase by
approximately $2.6 million to a net loss of approximately $6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from net loss
of $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Results of Operations   Nine months
ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine months ended September 30, 2015  

The following table sets
forth, for the periods indicated, data derived from our statements of operations: 

Revenues  

We recorded no commercial
revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Research and Development Expense  

Research and development
expenses increased by $2.9 million to $13.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $10.7 million. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred an increase of approximately $2.5 million of Actimab-A costs. The increase was partially
offset by a decrease of approximately $0.8 million of Iomab-B costs. We expect to incur increased research and development costs
in the future.  

General and Administrative Expenses  

Overall, total general and
administrative expenses decreased by approximately $2.8 million from $9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015
to $6.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was largely attributable to decrease in salaries and stock compensation
costs of approximately $2.7 million and other related expenses and professional services. We expect to incur increased general
and administrative costs in the future. 

Other Income (Expense)  

Other income was $2.4 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to other income of $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The Company recorded a gain on the change in fair value of the Company s embedded derivative liability in the approximate
amount $2.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a gain of approximately $5.4 million during
the comparable nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. The change is mainly attributable to the fluctuation of the Company s
stock price. 

Net
Loss   

Net loss increased by
approximately $3.1 million to $17.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $14.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a gain from change in fair value of the derivative
liability in the current nine-month period compared to the gain recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We
have financed our operations primarily through sales of the Company s common stock.  

We
do not have any cash or cash equivalents held in financial institutions located outside of the United States as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015. We do not anticipate this practice will change in the future.  

The
following tables sets forth selected cash flow information for the periods indicated:  

Net cash used in operating
activities was approximately $16.5 million and $14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Net cash provided by
financing activities was approximately $6.5 million and $32.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $6.8 million
from the sale of our common stock through our ATM compared to approximately $32.8 million received from the March 2015 and June
2015 financings. The issuance of stock during the two comparative periods were partially offset by payments on notes payable of
$0.3 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Recent
Equity Offerings   

On March 24, 2014, we
filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the  Registration Statement ) and deemed effective on April 17,
2014. This Registration Statement contained two prospectuses: (i) a base prospectus which covers the offering, issuance and sale
by the Company of up to $200,000,000 of its common stock, preferred stock, warrants and/or units; and (ii) a sales agreement prospectus
covering the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $75,000,000 of its common stock
that may be issued and sold under a sales agreement (the  Sales Agreement ) with MLV   Co. LLC ( MLV ).
During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 423,422 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $0.7 million.
Since inception of this agreement through September 30, 2016, the Company issued 9,131,112 shares of common stock for gross proceeds
of $22.2 million. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 125,862 common shares for the cashless exercise of warrants. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued common shares totaling 26,000 for restricted shares granted that were not
registered.  

On October 4, 2016 the
Company closed an underwritten public offering of 8,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The gross proceeds to the Company
from this offering was $10,000,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses
payable by the Company. The offering was conducted pursuant to a shelf registration statement that was previously filed with,
and declared effective on April 17, 2014 by, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors.  

Seasonality   

We
do not have a seasonal business cycle. Our operating results are generally derived evenly throughout the calendar year.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Our
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. To prepare
these consolidated financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities. These estimates also affect our expenses. Judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses the accounting
policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results.  

Derivatives   

All
derivatives are recorded at fair value and recorded on the balance sheet. Fair values for securities traded in the open market
and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. Where market prices are not readily available, fair values are determined using
market based pricing models incorporating readily observable market data and requiring judgment and estimates.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction
between market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority
to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair
value hierarchy is as follows:  

Level
1 Inputs   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has
the ability to access at the measurement date.  

Level
2 Inputs   Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical
or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset
or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally
from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means.  

Level
3 Inputs   Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity's own assumptions
about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.  

Research
and Development Costs   

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development reimbursements and grants are recorded by the Company
as a reduction of research and development costs.  

Share-Based
Payments   

The
Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value determined represents the cost for the award and is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee
is required to provide service in exchange for the award. As share-based compensation expense is recognized based on awards ultimately
expected to vest, the Company reduces the expense for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates. Previously recognized
compensation costs may be adjusted to reflect the actual forfeiture rate for the entire award at the end of the vesting period.
Excess tax benefits, if any, are recognized as an addition to paid-in capital.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No.
2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  (topic 718). The FASB issued this update to improve the accounting
for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b)
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The updated guidance
is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.  

In
February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02  Leases  (topic 842), which creates new accounting and reporting guidelines
for leasing arrangements. The new guidance requires organizations that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities on the
balance sheet related to the rights and obligations created by those leases, regardless of whether they are classified as finance
or operating leases. Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows
arising from a lease primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The guidance also requires new
disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from
leases. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods
within that reporting period, with early application permitted. The new standard is to be applied using a modified retrospective
approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material
effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   

Common
Stock Price Risk    

In December 2012, we
issued common stock and warrants. Pursuant to ASC 815-40, we recorded the fair value of the warrants as a current liability. The
fair value of the outstanding warrants is evaluated at each reporting period with any resulting change in the fair value being
reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized the
change in the value of warrants of approximately $2.4 million and $5.4 million, respectively, as a gain on the consolidated statements
of operations. Fair value of the derivative instruments will be affected by estimates of various factors that may affect the respective
instrument, including our stock price, the risk free rate of return and expected volatility in the fair value of our stock price.
As the fair value of this derivative may fluctuate significantly from period to period, the resulting change in valuation may
have a significant impact on our results of operations. 

On March 24, 2014,
we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the  Registration Statement ) that was deemed effective on April
17, 2014. This Registration Statement contained two prospectuses: (i) a base prospectus which covers the offering, issuance and
sale by the Company of up to $200,000,000 of its common stock, preferred stock, warrants and/or units; and (ii) a sales agreement
prospectus covering the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $75,000,000 of its common
stock that may be issued and sold under a sales agreement (the  Sales Agreement ) with MLV. During the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, the Company issued 423,422 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $0.7 million. Since inception of this
agreement through September 30, 2016, the Company issued 9,131,112 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $22.2 million. 

Sales
of our common stock through MLV, if any, will be made on the NYSE MKT LLC, on any other existing trading market for the common
stock or through a market maker. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, MLV will use commercially reasonable
efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions (including any price, time or size limits or other
customary parameters or conditions we may impose). We will pay to MLV in cash, upon the sale of common stock pursuant to the Sales
Agreement, an amount equal to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of common stock. We have also provided MLV with customary
indemnification rights.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief
executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of September
30, 2016, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Based upon such evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal financial
and accounting officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to
provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in our filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or SEC, under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer
and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in our system of internal controls over financial reporting
during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS   

In
analyzing our company, you should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included
in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015. Factors that could cause or contribute to differences in our actual results include those discussed in the following subsection,
as well as those discussed above in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
and elsewhere throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Each of the following risk factors, either alone or taken together,
could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment
in our Company The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known
to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business
operations.   

Risks
Related to Our Business   

We
have generated no revenue from commercial sales to date and our future profitability is uncertain.    

We have a limited operating
history and our business is subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. Our likelihood
of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered
in connection with this development and expansion. Since we began our business, we have focused on research, development and clinical
trials of product candidates, and have incurred losses since inception. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit
of approximately $130 million. Although we believe we have enough working capital for operations for the next 12 months, if we
continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a profitable company, we may be unable to continue our operations. We expect
to continue to operate at a net loss as we continue our research and development efforts, continue to conduct clinical trials
and develop manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. There can be no assurance that the products under development
by us will be approved for sale in the United States or elsewhere. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that if such products
are approved they will be successfully commercialized, and the extent of our future losses and the timing of our profitability
are highly uncertain.  

If
we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to continue or complete our product development
and you will likely lose your entire investment.    

Although
we believe we have enough working capital for operations for the next 12 months, we do not currently have sufficient capital for
the development and commercialization of our lead product candidate and we will need to continue to seek capital from time to
time to continue development of our lead product candidates and to acquire and develop other product candidates. Our first product
candidate is not expected to be commercialized, if approved, until at least 2018 and we do not expect that the partnering revenues
it will generate will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations. Our cash balance as of September 30, 2016 was approximately
$15.5 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we raised total net proceeds of approximately $6.8 million from
the completion of public offerings of common stock. We believe we have enough cash for at least the next 12 months to finance
research and development and to cover our ongoing working capital needs.  

Our
business or operations may change in a manner that would consume available funds more rapidly than anticipated and substantial
additional funding may be required to maintain operations, fund expansion, develop new or enhanced products, acquire complementary
products, business or technologies or otherwise respond to competitive pressures and opportunities, such as a change in the regulatory
environment or a change in preferred cancer treatment modalities. However, we may not be able to secure funding when we need it
or on favorable terms.  

To
raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into
or exchangeable for our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other
offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors, and investors purchasing
shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we
sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in future
transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share in this offering. Additionally, you may incur dilution as a result
of grants of equity awards under our equity incentive plans, or upon exercise of options or warrants currently outstanding with
exercise prices at or below the public offering price of our common stock in this offering.  

If
we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we will have to delay, scale-back or eliminate our research
and development activities, clinical studies or future operations. We may also be required to obtain funds through arrangements
with collaborators, which arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or products that we otherwise
would not consider relinquishing, including rights to future product candidates or certain major geographic markets. We may further
have to license our technology to others. This could result in sharing revenues which we might otherwise have retained for ourselves.
Any of these actions may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

The
amount of capital we may need depends on many factors, including the progress, timing and scope of our product development programs;
the progress, timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials; the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory
approvals; the time and cost necessary to further develop manufacturing processes and arrange for contract manufacturing; our
ability to enter into and maintain collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships; and our partners  commitment
of time and resources to the development and commercialization of our products.  

We
have limited access to the capital markets and even if we can raise additional funding, we may be required to do so on terms that
are dilutive to you.    

We
have limited access to the capital markets to raise capital. The capital markets have been unpredictable in the recent past for
radio-immunotherapy and other oncology companies and unprofitable companies such as ours. In addition, it is generally difficult
for development stage companies to raise capital under current market conditions. The amount of capital that a company such as
ours is able to raise often depends on variables that are beyond our control. As a result, we may not be able to secure financing
on terms attractive to us, or at all. If we are able to consummate a financing arrangement, the amount raised may not be sufficient
to meet our future needs. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, our business, including our technology
licenses, results of operations, financial condition and our continued viability will be materially adversely affected.  

If
we fail to obtain or maintain necessary FDA approval for our radio-immunotherapy products, or if such approvals are delayed, we
will be unable to commercially distribute and market our products.    

Our
products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities.
The process of seeking regulatory approval to market a radio-immunotherapy product is expensive and time-consuming and, notwithstanding
the effort and expense incurred, approval is never guaranteed. If we are not successful in obtaining timely approval of Company
products from the FDA, we may never be able to generate significant revenue and may be forced to cease operations. In particular,
the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new radio-immunotherapy product only after a Biologics License Application (BLA)
for the product has received FDA approval. The BLA process is costly, lengthy and inherently uncertain. Any BLA filed by us will
have to be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and
labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use. The
lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain
regulatory approval to market our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.
In addition, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or
more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent
on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include
the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the foregoing
scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.  

The
approval process in the United States and in other countries could result in unexpected and significant costs for us and consume
management s time and other resources. The FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies could ask us to supplement our submissions,
collect non-clinical data, conduct additional clinical trials or engage in other time-consuming actions, or it could simply deny
our applications. In addition, even if we obtain approval to market our products in the United States or in other countries, the
approval could be revoked or other restrictions imposed if post-market data demonstrates safety issues or lack of effectiveness.
We cannot predict with certainty how, or when, the FDA or other regulatory authorities will act. If we are unable to obtain the
necessary regulatory approvals, our financial condition and cash flow may be materially adversely affected, and our ability to
grow domestically and internationally may be limited. Additionally, even if we obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve
any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications that we request. The Company s products may not be approved
for the specific indications that are most necessary or desirable for successful commercialization or profitability.  

Our
radio-immunotherapy product candidates are in the early stages of development; and we have not demonstrated that any of our products
are safe and effective for any indication.    

We
currently have only two products in clinical development. We have commenced a Phase 1/2 multi- center AML trial with fractionated
doses of Actimab -A under its own federal Investigational New Drug Application (IND). Additionally, there are a number of
physician IND trials at the FHCRC that have been conducted or are currently ongoing at FHCRC with single doses of Iomab -B.
In December 2015, the FDA cleared our IND filing for Iomab-B, and that we will proceed with the pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trial.
In June 2016, we announced the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for Iomab-B was initiated and assuming that the trial meets its
end points, it will form the basis for a Biologics Licensing Application (BLA).   

We
cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory
authorities to delay, suspend, or discontinue clinical trials or to delay the analysis of data from ongoing clinical trials. Any
of the following could delay or disrupt the clinical development of our product candidates and potentially cause our product candidates
to fail to receive regulatory approval:  

conditions
    imposed on us by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;   

delays
    in receiving, or the inability to obtain, required approvals from institutional review boards (IRBs) or other reviewing entities
    at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;   

delays
    in enrolling patients into clinical trials;   

a
    lower than anticipated retention rate of patients in clinical trials;   

the
    need to repeat or discontinue clinical trials as a result of inconclusive or negative results or unforeseen complications
    in testing or because the results of later trials may not confirm positive results from earlier preclinical studies or clinical
    trials;   

inadequate
    supply, delays in distribution deficient quality of, or inability to purchase or manufacture drug product, comparator drugs
    or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;   

unfavorable
    FDA or other foreign regulatory inspection and review of a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation;   

serious
    and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials, which may occur even if they
    were not observed in earlier trials or only observed in a limited number of participants;   

a
    finding that the trial participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;   

the
    placement by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority of a clinical hold on a trial; or   

delays
    in obtaining regulatory agency authorization for the conduct of our clinical trials.   

We
may suspend, or the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may require us to suspend, clinical trials of a product candidate
at any time if we or they believe the patients participating in such clinical trials, or in independent third party clinical trials
for drugs based on similar technologies, are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons.  

Further,
individuals involved with our clinical trials may serve as consultants to us from time to time and receive stock options or cash
compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation to the clinical investigator
carrying out the study result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or the FDA concludes that the financial relationship
may have affected interpretation of the study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be
questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. The delay, suspension or discontinuation of any of
our clinical trials, or a delay in the analysis of clinical data for our product candidates, for any of the foregoing reasons,
could adversely affect our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our product candidates, increase our
operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.  

Clinical
trials may also be delayed or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results. In addition, a clinical trial may
be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, the IRBs at the sites where the IRBs are overseeing a trial, or a data safety monitoring
board, or DSMB, overseeing the clinical trial at issue, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:  

failure
    to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;   

inspection
    of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of
    a clinical hold;   

varying
    interpretation of data by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities;   

failure
    to achieve primary or secondary endpoints or other failure to demonstrate efficacy;   

unforeseen
    safety issues; or   

lack
    of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.   

Additionally,
changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes.
Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the cost, timing
or successful completion of a clinical trial.  

In
addition, neither we nor any relevant collaborative partner(s) has yet undertaken any clinical assessment or investigation of
Company radio-immunotherapy product candidates for other indications, including colon cancer or prostate cancer. Significant further
investment may be required to acquire antibody rights and to undertake necessary research and continued development. Further laboratory
and specific clinical testing will be required prior to regulatory approval of any product candidates. Adverse or inconclusive
results from pre-clinical testing or clinical trials of product candidates may substantially delay, or halt entirely, any further
development of one or more of our products. The projected timetables for continued development of the technologies and related
product candidates by us may otherwise be subject to delay or suspension.  

Modifications
to our product candidates may require federal approvals.    

The
BLA application is the vehicle through which the company may formally propose that the FDA approve a new pharmaceutical for sale
and marketing in the United States. Once a particular product candidate receives FDA approval, expanded uses or uses in new indications
of our products may require additional human clinical trials and new regulatory approvals, including additional IND and BLA submissions
and premarket approvals before we can begin clinical development, and/or prior to marketing and sales. If the FDA requires new
approvals for a particular use or indication, we may be required to conduct additional clinical studies, which would require additional
expenditures and harm our operating results. If the products are already being used for these new indications, we may also be
subject to significant enforcement actions.  

Conducting
clinical trials and obtaining approvals can be a time-consuming process, and delays in obtaining required future approvals could
adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.  

There
is no guarantee that the FDA will approve BLAs for our product candidates and failure to obtain necessary approvals for our product
candidates would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.    

We
recently completed the Phase 1 portion of a multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical trial for our product candidate, Actimab -A,
in AML and in the future expect to submit a BLA to the FDA for approval of this product. This product candidate is also the subject
of an ongoing human safety trial being conducted under a physician IND at MSKCC. We are in the early stages of evaluating other
product candidates consisting of conjugates of Ac-225 with human or humanized antibodies for pre-clinical and clinical development
in other types of cancer. In June 2012, we acquired rights to Iomab , a Phase 2 clinical stage monoclonal antibody with
safety and efficacy data in more than 250 patients in need of HSCT. We are now conducting a pivotal Phase 3 trial with Iomab-B
in 150 patients. Product candidates utilizing this antibody would also require BLA approval before they can be marketed in the
United States. The FDA may not approve these products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization.
Indeed, the FDA may fail to approve any BLA we submit for new product candidates or for new intended uses or indications for approved
products or future product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval for our products in the proposed indications would have
an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.  

Clinical
trials necessary to support approval of BLAs for our product candidates will be time consuming and expensive. Delays or failures
in our clinical trials may prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and will adversely affect our business, operating
results and prospects and could cause us to cease operations.    

Initiating
and completing clinical trials necessary to support FDA approval of a BLA for Actimab -A and other product candidates, is
a time-consuming and expensive process, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials
are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any product candidate we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable
results in later clinical trials. We have worked with the FDA to develop a clinical trial designed to test the initial safety
and efficacy of Actimab -A in newly diagnosed AML patients over the age of 60, and on October 6, 2008, and January 5, 2009,
we submitted IND amendments to the FDA for the conduct of a multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical trial for treatment of AML. The trial
is now underway with the purpose of examining the use of Actimab -A in AML patients who are not eligible for approved forms
of treatment with curative intent. The trial is not designed to support marketing approval for the product candidate, and one
or more additional trials will have to be conducted in the future before we file a BLA. In addition, there can be no assurance
that the data generated during the trial will meet our chosen safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results
that will eventually support the filing or approval of a BLA. Even if the data from this trial are favorable, these data may not
be predictive of the results of any future clinical trials.  

The
issued patents, which are licensed by us for the HuM-195 antibody, our acute myeloid leukemia targeting antibody, may expire before
we have commercialized Actimab -A.    

The
humanized antibody which we use in the conjugated Actimab -A product candidate is covered by the claims of issued patents
that we license from Facet Biotech Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie Laboratories. After these patents expire,
others may be eventually able to use an antibody with the same sequence, and we will then need to rely on additional patent protection
covering alpha particle drug products comprising actinium 225. Any competing product based on the HuM-195 antibody is likely to
require several years of development before achieving our product candidate s current status and may be subject to significant
regulatory hurdles, but is nevertheless a possibility that can affect the Company s business in the future.  

Additionally,
because we expect that certain of these patents will expire prior to commercialization of Actimab -A, we expect that in
order to attract a commercialization partner for that product candidate, we may need to reach an agreement with AbbVie to reduce
the milestone payments and royalties currently required to be paid under our license agreement for HuM-195. There can be no assurance
that the parties will be able to agree on an amendment to the terms of the license. Failure to reach such an agreement could materially
adversely affect our ability to find a commercialization partner for Actimab -A which may materially harm our business.  

Iomab -B
is not patent protected.    

Neither
the antibody portion nor the composition of matter as a whole for the conjugated Iomab  product candidate is covered by
the claims of any issued or pending patents. Accordingly, there are no patents that would prevent others from using an antibody
with the same antibody sequence in any drug product (e.g., those comprising iodine 131 or alpha particle emitters). Any competing
product based on the antibody used in Iomab-B  is likely to require several years of development before achieving our product
candidate s current status and may be subject to significant regulatory hurdles, but is nevertheless a possibility that
could negatively impact the Company s business in the future.  

We
may be unable to obtain a sufficient supply of Ac-225 medical grade isotope in order to continue clinical trials and to allow
for the manufacture of commercial quantities of Actimab -A    

There
are limited quantities of Ac-225 available today. The existing supplier of Ac-225 to us is the ORNL, which is a science and energy
national laboratory in the Department of Energy system. ORNL manufactures Ac-225 by eluting it from its supply of Thorium-229.
Although this has proven to be a very reliable source of production for a number of years, it is limited by the quantity of Thorium-229
at ORNL. We believe that the current approximate maximum of Ac-225 production from this source is sufficient for approximately
1,000 2,000 patient treatments per year. Since our needs are significantly below that amount at this time, and will continue
to be below that for as long as we do not have a commercial product with a potential of selling more than 2,000 patient doses
per year, we believe that this supply will be sufficient for completion of clinical trials and early commercialization. To secure
supplies beyond this amount, we have developed what we believe to be a scalable cost-effective process for manufacturing Ac-225
in a cyclotron at an estimated cost in excess of $5 million. This work has been conducted at Technical University Munich (TUM)
in Germany. We are now in possession of detailed descriptions of all the developed manufacturing procedures and have rights to
all relevant patent applications and other intellectual property. However, we do not currently have access to a commercial cyclotron
capable of producing medical grade Ac-225. Although beam time on such cyclotrons is commercially available, we do not currently
have a relationship with any entity that owns or controls a suitable cyclotron. We have identified possible sources and estimate
that we could secure the necessary beam time when needed at a cost of approximately $2 million per year. In the meantime, our
contract for supply of this isotope from ORNL must be renewed yearly, and the current contract extends through the end of 2016.
While we expect this contract will be renewed at the end of its term, there can be no assurance that ORNL will decide to renew
the contract or that the United States Department of Energy will not change its policies that allow for the sale of isotope to
us. Failure to acquire sufficient quantities of medical grade Ac-225 would make it impossible to effectively complete clinical
trials and to commercialize Actimab -A and would materially harm our business.  

Conducting
successful clinical studies may require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to
identify and recruit.    

Patient
enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the size
of the patient population; the nature of the trial protocol; the availability of approved effective treatments for the relevant
disease; competition from other clinical trial programs for similar indications; the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and
risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects; the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators;
support staff; and proximity of patients to clinical sites and ability to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for
participation in the clinical trial and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical
trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and
effectiveness of our product candidates or if they determine that the treatments received under the trial protocols are not attractive
or involve unacceptable risks or discomforts. Patients may also not participate in our clinical trials if they choose to participate
in contemporaneous clinical trials of competitive product candidates. In addition, patients participating in refractory AML clinical
trials are seriously and often terminally ill and therefore may not complete the clinical trial due to reasons including comorbid
conditions or occurrence of adverse medical events related or unrelated to the investigational products, or death.  

Development
of sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy are required and we may not adequately develop
such protocols to support approval.    

The
FDA may require us to submit data on a greater number of patients than we originally anticipated and/or for a longer follow-up
period or change the data collection requirements or data analysis applicable to our clinical trials. It may also require additional
data on certain categories of patients, should it emerge during the conduct of our clinical trials that certain categories of
patients are likely to be affected in different and/or additional manners than the rest of the patient population. In addition
to FDA requirements, our clinical trials require the approval of the IRB at each site selected. We have submitted our clinical
trial protocol for our Phase 1/2 Actimab -A clinical trial to the IRBs for the Phase 1 portion of the trial. We intend to
expand the number of participating sites for the Phase 2 portion of the trial and we will need to obtain approval of the IRB at
each additional sites selected. Our clinical trial protocols have not been rejected by any IRB to date.  

FDA
may take actions that would prolong, delay, suspend, or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates, which may delay or
prevent us from commercializing our product candidates on a timely basis, causing us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt
of any revenue from potential product sales.    

There
can be no assurance that the data generated in our clinical trials will be acceptable to FDA or that if future modifications during
the trial are necessary, that any such modifications will be acceptable to FDA. Certain modifications to a clinical trial protocol
made during the course of the clinical trial have to be submitted to the FDA. This could result in the delay or halt of a clinical
trial while the modification is evaluated. In addition, depending on the quantity and nature of the changes made, FDA could take
the position that some or all of the data generated by the clinical trial is not usable because the same protocol was not used
throughout the trial. This might require the enrollment of additional subjects, which could result in the extension of the clinical
trial and the FDA delaying approval of a product candidate. If the FDA believes that its prior approval is required for a particular
modification, it can delay or halt a clinical trial while it evaluates additional information regarding the change.  

Serious
injury or death resulting from a failure of one of our product candidates during current or future clinical trials could also
result in the FDA delaying our clinical trials or denying or delaying approval of a product candidate.  

The
Phase 1 portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial for Actimab -A was conducted at seven clinical centers in the
United States (MSKCC, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Johns Hopkins Medicine, University of
Pennsylvania Health System, Baylor Summons Cancer Center and Columbia University Medical Center) was designed to establish the
maximum tolerated dose of the product. As the Company expected, patients receiving highest dose of the drug administered in the
trial so far had prolonged bone marrow suppression which could lead to fatal infections and other severe consequences. Consequently,
the dose levels of our drug in that trial were reduced as we continue our work on establishing maximum tolerated dose.  

Even
though an adverse event may not be the result of our product candidate, the FDA or an IRB could delay or halt a clinical trial
for an indefinite period of time while an adverse event is reviewed, and likely would do so in the event of multiple such events.  

Any
delay or termination of our current or future clinical trials as a result of the risks summarized above, including delays in obtaining
or maintaining required approvals from IRBs, delays in patient enrollment, the failure of patients to continue to participate
in a clinical trial, and delays or termination of clinical trials as a result of protocol modifications or adverse events during
the trials, may cause an increase in costs and delays in the filing of any submissions with the FDA, delay the approval and commercialization
of our product candidates or result in the failure of the clinical trial, which could adversely affect our business, operating
results and prospects. Lengthy delays in the completion of our Actimab -A clinical trials would adversely affect our business
and prospects and could cause us to cease operations.  

If
the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with pre-clinical development do not perform
as contractually required or expected, or fail to comply with applicable regulations and standards, we may not be able to obtain
regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.    

We
do not have the ability to independently conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials for our product candidates and we must rely
on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories
to conduct such trials. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities results in reduced control over
these activities. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as GCPs, for conducting,
recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and
that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities
and requirements. If we or any of our third party contractors fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated
in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform
additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory
authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition,
our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations. Our
failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.  

To
date, we believe our consultants, contract research organizations and other similar entities with which we are working have performed
well; however, if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, or comply
with applicable regulations, we may be required to replace them. Although we believe that there are a number of other third-party
contractors we could engage to continue these activities, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative third-party
contractors or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, which may result in a delay of our planned clinical trials. Accordingly,
we may be delayed in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates and may be delayed in our efforts to successfully
develop our product candidates.  

In
addition, our third-party contractors are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with
such third-party contractors, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical,
nonclinical and preclinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory
obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data
they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons,
our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be
able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all, and
our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators
may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control.  

The
future results of our current or future clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims or may result in the discovery
of unexpected adverse side effects.    

Even
if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product candidate claims
or that the FDA or foreign authorities will agree with our conclusions regarding them. Success in pre-clinical studies and early
clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will
replicate the results of prior trials and pre-clinical studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product
candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses. If FDA concludes that the clinical trials for Actimab -A,
or any other product candidate for which we might seek approval, have failed to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, we would
not receive FDA approval to market that product candidate in the United States for the indications sought. In addition, such an
outcome could cause us to abandon the product candidate and might delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our
clinical trials will delay or preclude the filing of any submissions with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize
our product candidates and generate revenues. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse
side effects that are not currently part of a product candidate s profile. In addition, our clinical trials for Actimab -A
involve a relatively small patient population. Because of the small sample size, their results may not be indicative of future
results.  

Our
product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.    

Our
product candidates are regulated by the FDA as biologic products and we intend to seek approval for these products pursuant to
the BLA pathway. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated pathway for the
approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biologic products. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for
the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as  interchangeable 
based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved
by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted
and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it
is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a
material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biologic products.  

Actimab -A
and future product candidates may never achieve market acceptance.    

Actimab -A
and future product candidates that we may develop may never gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical
community. The degree of market acceptance of any of product will depend on a number of factors, including the actual and perceived
effectiveness and reliability of the product; the results of any long-term clinical trials relating to use of the product; the
availability, relative cost and perceived advantages and disadvantages of alternative technologies; the degree to which treatments
using the product are approved for reimbursement by public and private insurers; the strength of our marketing and distribution
infrastructure; and the level of education and awareness among physicians and hospitals concerning the product.  

Failure
of Actimab -A or any of our other product candidates to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively
impact our business financial condition and results of operations  .    

To
be commercially successful, physicians must be persuaded that using our product candidates for treatment of AML and other cancers,
if approved for those indications, are effective alternatives to existing therapies and treatments.    

We
believe that oncologists and other physicians will not widely adopt a product candidate unless they determine, based on experience,
clinical data, and published peer-reviewed journal articles, that the use of that product candidate provides an effective alternative
to other means of treating specific cancers. Patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our product
candidates does not provide patients with sufficient benefits in extension of life or quality of life. We believe that recommendations
and support for the use of each product candidate from influential physicians will be essential for widespread market acceptance.
Our product candidates are still in the development stage and it is premature to attempt to gain support from physicians at this
time. We can provide no assurance that such support will ever be obtained. If our product candidates do not receive such support
from these physicians and from long-term data, physicians may not use or continue to use, and hospitals may not purchase or continue
to purchase, them.  

Both
before and after marketing approval, our product candidates are subject to ongoing regulatory requirements and continued regulatory
review, and if we fail to comply with these continuing regulatory requirements, we could be subject to a variety of sanctions
and the sale of any approved products could be suspended.    

Both
before and after regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse
event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, distribution and record keeping related to the product are subject to extensive,
ongoing regulatory requirements enforced by FDA and other similar regulatory bodies. Additionally, because our product candidates
include radio-active isotopes, they will be subject to additional regulation and oversight from the United States Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) and similar bodies in other jurisdictions. The FDA regulatory requirements include submissions of safety and
other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP requirements and GCP requirements
for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may
also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval,
or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to
monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including
adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure
to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable United States and foreign regulatory authorities could
subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:  

restrictions
    on the marketing of our products or their manufacturing processes;   

warning
    letters;   

civil
    or criminal penalties;   

fines;   

injunctions;   

product
    seizures or detentions;   

import
    or export bans;   

voluntary
    or mandatory product recalls and related publicity requirements;   

suspension
    or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;   

total
    or partial suspension of production; and   

refusal
    to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.   

The
FDA s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory
approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new
requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we
may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.  

Even
if regulatory approval of a product candidate is granted, such approval may be subject to limitations on the intended uses for
which a product may be marketed and reduce the potential to successfully commercialize that product and generate revenue from
that product. If the FDA determines that the product promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing or educational
activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we or our commercialization partners cease or modify
our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal,
state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider such training or other promotional materials to constitute
promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as
laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.  

Our
revenue stream will depend upon third party coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved.    

The
commercial success of our product candidates in both domestic and international markets will be substantially dependent on whether
third-party coverage and reimbursement is available for patients that use our products. However, the availability of insurance
coverage and reimbursement for newly approved cancer therapies is uncertain, and therefore, third-party coverage may be particularly
difficult to obtain even if our products are approved by the FDA as safe and efficacious. Patients using existing approved therapies
are generally reimbursed all or part of the product cost by Medicare or other third-party payors. Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance
organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and
the level of reimbursement of new drugs, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for these products.
Submission of applications for reimbursement approval generally does not occur prior to the filing of a BLA for that product and
may not be granted until many months after BLA approval. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for these products, we
or our commercialization partners may have to agree to a net sales price lower than the net sales price we might charge in other
sales channels. The continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare may limit
our revenue. Initial dependence on the commercial success of our products may make our revenues particularly susceptible to any
cost containment or reduction efforts.  

We
have no manufacturing capacity and depend on third-party manufacturers to produce our pre-clinical and clinical trial drug supplies.    

We
do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for pre-clinical or clinical production of any of our product candidates. We
lack experience in drug manufacturing, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates
on a clinical or commercial scale. As a result, we rely on a third-party manufacturer to supply, store, and distribute pre-clinical
and clinical supply of our product candidates, and plan to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Any performance failure
on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates
or commercialization of any approved products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.  

Our
product candidates require precise, high quality manufacturing. Failure by our contract manufacturer to achieve and maintain high
manufacturing standards could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in testing
or delivery, cost overruns, or other problems that could seriously hurt our business. Contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties
involving production yields, quality control, and quality assurance. These manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced
inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs and other applicable
government regulations and corresponding foreign standards; however, we do not have control over third-party manufacturers 
compliance with these regulations and standards.  

If
a contract manufacturer cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace it. We may incur added costs and delays in identifying
and qualifying replacements because the FDA must approve any replacement manufacturer prior to manufacturing our product candidates.
Such approval would require new testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated
in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our product candidates after receipt of FDA approval.  

We
anticipate continued reliance on third parties for manufacturing and marketing, if we are successful in obtaining marketing approval
from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for any of our product candidates. If we are not able to secure favorable arrangements
with such third parties, our business and financial condition would be harmed, and our commercialization of any of our product
candidates may be halted, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to obtain such approvals, fail to provide
us with sufficient quantities of product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.    

To
date, our product candidates have been manufactured in small quantities for preclinical and clinical testing by third-party manufacturers.
If the FDA or other regulatory agencies approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale, we expect that we would continue
to rely, at least initially, on third-party specialized manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of approved products. These
manufacturers may not be able to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any approved product in a timely or economic
manner, or at all. Significant scale-up of manufacturing may require additional validation studies, which the FDA must review
and approve. If third party manufacturers are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product candidate,
or we are unable to establish our own manufacturing capabilities, the commercial launch of any approved products may be delayed
or there may be a shortage in supply, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

In
addition, the facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA
pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit a BLA to the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing process of,
and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMPs. If our contract manufacturers
cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA
or other regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities.
If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates
or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly
impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.  

We
also intend to partner with larger pharmaceutical companies for the commercialization of any of our product candidates that are
approved. In connection with our efforts to commercialize our product candidates, we will seek to secure favorable arrangements
with third parties to distribute, promote, market and sell them. If we are not able to secure favorable commercial terms or arrangements
with third parties for distribution, marketing, promotion and sales of our product candidates, we may have to retain promotional
and marketing rights and seek to develop the commercial resources necessary to promote or co-promote or co-market certain or all
of our product candidates to the appropriate channels of distribution in order to reach the specific medical market that we are
targeting. We may not be able to enter into any partnering arrangements on this or any other basis. If we are not able to secure
favorable partnering arrangements, or are unable to develop the appropriate resources necessary for the commercialization of our
product candidates, our business and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, we will have to hire additional employees
or consultants, since our current employees have limited experience in these areas. Sufficient employees with relevant skills
may not be available to us. Any increase in the number of our employees would increase our expense level, and could have an adverse
effect on our financial position.  

In
addition, we, or our potential commercial partners, may not successfully introduce our product candidates or they may not achieve
acceptance by patients, health care providers and insurance companies. Further, it is possible that we may not be able to secure
arrangements to manufacture, market, distribute, promote and sell our product candidates at favorable commercial terms that would
permit us to make a profit. To the extent that corporate partners conduct clinical trials, we may not be able to control the design
and conduct of these clinical trials.  

We
may have conflicts with our partners that could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product candidates.    

We
may have conflicts with our partners, such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of preclinical or clinical data, the achievement
of milestones, the interpretation of contractual obligations, payments for services, development obligations or the ownership
of intellectual property developed during our collaboration. If any conflicts arise with any of our partners, such partner may
act in a manner that is adverse to our best interests. Any such disagreement could result in one or more of the following, each
of which could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product candidates, and in turn prevent us from generating
revenues: unwillingness on the part of a partner to pay us milestone payments or royalties we believe are due under a collaboration;
uncertainty regarding ownership of intellectual property rights arising from our collaborative activities, which could prevent
us from entering into additional collaborations; unwillingness by the partner to cooperate in the development or manufacture of
the product, including providing us with product data or materials; unwillingness on the part of a partner to keep us informed
regarding the progress of its development and commercialization activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those
activities; initiating litigation or alternative dispute resolution options by either party to resolve the dispute; or attempts
by either party to terminate the agreement.  

Upon
commercialization of our product candidates, we may be dependent on third parties to market, distribute and sell them.    

Our
ability to generate revenues may be dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of any future co-marketing partners and third-party
distributors. At this time, we have not entered into an agreement with any commercialization partner and only plan to do so after
the successful completion of Phase 2 clinical trials and prior to commercialization. If we fail to reach an agreement with any
commercialization partner, or if upon reaching such an agreement that partner fails to sell a large volume of our products, it
may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Our
product candidates will face significant competition in the markets for them, and if they are unable to compete successfully,
our business will suffer.    

Our
product candidates face, and will continue to face, intense competition from large pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic
and research institutions. We compete in an industry that is characterized by (i) rapid technological change, (ii) evolving industry
standards, (iii) emerging competition and (iv) new product introductions. Our competitors have existing products and technologies
that will compete with our product candidates and technologies and may develop and commercialize additional products and technologies
that will compete with our product candidates and technologies. Because several competing companies and institutions have greater
financial resources than us, they may be able to (i) provide broader services and product lines, (ii) make greater investments
in research and development, or R D, and (iii) carry on broader R D initiatives. Our competitors also have greater development
capabilities than we do and have substantially greater experience in undertaking preclinical and clinical testing of product candidates,
obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. They also have greater name recognition
and better access to customers than us. Our chief competitors include companies such as Bayer AG, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Spectrum
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and others.  

If
side effects are identified during the time our product candidates are in development or after they are approved and on the market,
we may choose to or be required to perform lengthy additional clinical trials, discontinue development of the affected product
candidate, change the labeling of any such products, or withdraw or recall any such products from the market, any of which would
hinder or preclude our ability to generate revenues.    

Undesirable
side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials
and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign
authorities. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the
trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and
prospects significantly. Even if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, as greater numbers of patients use
a product following its approval, an increase in the incidence of side effects or the incidence of other post-approval problems
that were not seen or anticipated during pre-approval clinical trials could result in a number of potentially significant negative
consequences, including:  

regulatory
    authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;   

regulatory
    authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;   

we
    may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of
    the product;   

we
    may elect, or we may be required, to recall or withdraw product from the market;   

we
    could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and   

our
    reputation may suffer.   

Any
of these events could substantially increase the costs and expenses of developing, commercializing and marketing any such product
candidates or could harm or prevent sales of any approved products.  

Our
business depends upon securing and protecting critical intellectual property.    

Our
commercial success will depend in part on our obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark protection
of our technologies in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as successfully enforcing this intellectual property
and defending this intellectual property against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our technologies from
unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable intellectual property protection, such as patents or
trade secrets law, cover them. In particular, we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for
significant new technologies, products and processes. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is
uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or
keep our competitive advantage. Moreover, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain for product candidates
that are currently in the early stages of development because we cannot predict which of these product candidates will ultimately
reach the commercial market or whether the commercial versions of these product candidates will incorporate proprietary technologies.  

Our
patent position is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions.    

Accordingly,
we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced under our patents or in third-party patents. For example,
we or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and
issued patents; we or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions; others may
independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies; it is possible that none of our
pending patent applications or the pending patent applications of our licensors will result in issued patents; our issued patents
and issued patents of our licensors may not provide a basis for commercially viable technologies, or may not provide us with any
competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties; and, we may not develop additional proprietary
technologies that are patentable.  

As
a result, our owned and licensed patents may not be valid and we may not be able to obtain and enforce patents and to maintain
trade secret protection for the full commercial extent of our technology. The extent to which we are unable to do so could materially
harm our business.  

We
or our licensors have applied for and will continue to apply for patents for certain products. Such applications may not result
in the issuance of any patents, and any patents now held or that may be issued may not provide us with adequate protection from
competition. Furthermore, it is possible that patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged successfully. In that event,
if we have a preferred competitive position because of such patents, such preferred position would be lost. If we are unable to
secure or to continue to maintain a preferred position, we could become subject to competition from the sale of generic products.
Failure to receive, inability to protect, or expiration of our patents for medical use, manufacture, conjugation and labeling
of Ac-225, the antibodies that we license from third parties, or subsequent related filings, would adversely affect our business
and operations.  

Patents
issued or licensed to us may be infringed by the products or processes of others. The cost of enforcing our patent rights against
infringers, if such enforcement is required, could be significant, and we do not currently have the financial resources to fund
such litigation. Further, such litigation can go on for years and the time demands could interfere with our normal operations.
There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical
industry. We may become a party to patent litigation and other proceedings. The cost to us of any patent litigation, even if resolved
in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation more effectively
than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Litigation may also absorb significant management time.  

Unpatented
trade secrets, improvements, confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation are important to our scientific and
commercial success. Although we attempt to and will continue to attempt to protect our proprietary information through reliance
on trade secret laws and the use of confidentiality agreements with our partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and
other appropriate means, these measures may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information, and, in any event,
others may develop independently, or obtain access to, the same or similar information.  

Certain
of our patent rights are licensed to us by third parties. If we fail to comply with the terms of these license agreements, our
rights to those patents may be terminated, and we will be unable to conduct our business.  

If
we are found to be infringing on patents or trade secrets owned by others, we may be forced to cease or alter our product development
efforts, obtain a license to continue the development or sale of our products, and/or pay damages.    

Our
manufacturing processes and potential products may violate proprietary rights of patents that have been or may be granted to competitors,
universities or others, or the trade secrets of those persons and entities. As the pharmaceutical industry expands and more patents
are issued, the risk increases that our processes and potential products may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents
or trade secrets of others. These other persons could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin clinical
testing, manufacturing and marketing of the affected product or process. If any of these actions are successful, in addition to
any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to conduct clinical tests,
manufacture or market the affected product or use the affected process. Required licenses may not be available on acceptable terms,
if at all, and the results of litigation are uncertain. If we become involved in litigation or other proceedings, it could consume
a substantial portion of our financial resources and the efforts of our personnel.  

Our
ability to protect and enforce our patents does not guarantee that we will secure the right to commercialize our patents.    

A
patent is a limited monopoly right conferred upon an inventor, and his successors in title, in return for the making and disclosing
of a new and non-obvious invention. This monopoly is of limited duration but, while in force, allows the patent holder to prevent
others from making and/or using its invention. While a patent gives the holder this right to exclude others, it is not a license
to commercialize the invention where other permissions may be required for commercialization to occur. For example, a drug cannot
be marketed without the appropriate authorization from the FDA, regardless of the existence of a patent covering the product.
Further, the invention, even if patented itself, cannot be commercialized if it infringes the valid patent rights of another party.  

We
rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our trade secrets. If these agreements are breached by our employees or other parties,
our trade secrets may become known to our competitors.    

We
rely on trade secrets that we seek to protect through confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties. If these
agreements are breached, our competitors may obtain and use our trade secrets to gain a competitive advantage over us. We may
not have any remedies against our competitors and any remedies that may be available to us may not be adequate to protect our
business or compensate us for the damaging disclosure. In addition, we may have to expend resources to protect our interests from
possible infringement by others.  

The
use of hazardous materials, including radioactive and biological materials, in our research and development efforts imposes certain
compliance costs on us and may subject us to liability for claims arising from the use or misuse of these materials.    

Our
research, development and manufacturing activities involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals, radioactive
and biological materials, such as radioactive isotopes. We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws
and regulations governing, among other matters, the handling, storage, use and disposal of these materials and some waste products.
We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials and we could be held liable for any damages
that result, which could exceed our financial resources. We currently maintain insurance coverage for injuries resulting from
the hazardous materials we use; however, future claims may exceed the amount of our coverage. Also, we do not have insurance coverage
for pollution cleanup and removal. Currently the costs of complying with such federal, state, local and foreign environmental
regulations are not significant, and consist primarily of waste disposal expenses. However, they could become expensive, and current
or future environmental laws or regulations may impair our research, development, production and commercialization efforts.  

We
may undertake international operations, which will subject us to risks inherent with operations outside of the United States.    

Although
we do not have any foreign operations at this time, we intend to seek market clearances in foreign markets that we believe will
generate significant opportunities. However, even with the cooperating of a commercialization partner, conducting drug development
in foreign countries involves inherent risks, including, but not limited to difficulties in staffing, funding and managing foreign
operations; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; export restrictions; tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties
in protecting, acquiring, enforcing and litigating intellectual property rights; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and
potentially adverse tax consequences.  

If
we were to experience any of the difficulties listed above, or any other difficulties, any international development activities
and our overall financial condition may suffer and cause us to reduce or discontinue our international development and registration
efforts.  

We
may not be successful in hiring and retaining key employees.    

Our
future operations and successes depend in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team whom
we are highly dependent upon to manage our business. If any member of our current senior management terminates his or her employment
with us, such a departure may have a material adverse effect on our business.  

Our
future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire or engage, retain and motivate other well-qualified managerial,
technical, clinical and regulatory personnel. There can be no assurance that such professionals will be available in the market,
or that we will be able to retain existing professionals or meet or continue to meet their compensation requirements. Furthermore,
the cost base in relation to such compensation, which may include equity compensation, may increase significantly, which could
have a material adverse effect on us. Failure to establish and maintain an effective management team and work force could adversely
affect our ability to operate, grow and manage our business.  

We
may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and health information
privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.    

If
we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations
may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without
limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. These
laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to
patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect
our ability to operate include:  

the
    federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving,
    offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an
    item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;   

federal
    civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities
    from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors
    that are false or fraudulent;   

the
    federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created federal criminal statutes that
    prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;   

HIPAA,
    as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which
    imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;   

the
    federal physician sunshine requirements under PPACA, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and
    medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and
    other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests
    held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations;   

state
    law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or
    services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies
    to comply with the industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the
    federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources;
    state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians
    and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information
    in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.   

Because
of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some
of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform
legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal
anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute
or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Moreover, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that
a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent
claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.  

If
our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply
to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in
government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations,
any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.  

Healthcare
legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.    

In
March 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act (collectively,  PPACA ), which makes changes that are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical
industries. One of the principal aims of the PPACA as currently enacted is to expand health insurance coverage to approximately
32 million Americans who are currently uninsured. The consequences of this significant coverage expansion on the sales of our
products, once they are developed, are unknown and speculative at this point.  

The
PPACA contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions among other
things. This includes new fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, an abbreviated pathway for approval
of biosimilar products, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated
for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases in the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers
under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and an extension of the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care
organizations, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale
discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition
for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.  

The
PPACA provisions on comparative clinical effectiveness research extend the initiatives of the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009, also known as the stimulus package, which included $1.1 billion in funding to study the comparative effectiveness
of health care treatments and strategies. This stimulus funding was designated for, among other things, conducting, supporting
or synthesizing research that compares and evaluates the risks and benefits, clinical outcomes, effectiveness and appropriateness
of products. The PPACA appropriates additional funding to comparative clinical effectiveness research. Although Congress has indicated
that this funding is intended to improve the quality of health care, it remains unclear how the research will impact current Medicare
coverage and reimbursement or how new information will influence other third-party payor policies.  

In
addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the President
Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, creates the Joint Select Committee on Deficit
Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit
reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, which threatened to trigger the legislation s automatic
reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal
year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken.
On January 2, 2013, Congress passed and President Obama signed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which, among other things,
further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, including physicians, hospitals and cancer treatment centers. We expect
that the PPACA, as well as other federal or state health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a
material adverse effect on our industry generally and our ability to successfully commercialize our products or could limit or
eliminate our spending on certain development projects. The taxes imposed by the PPACA and the expansion in the government s
role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursement by payors for our products, and/or
reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Managing
our growth as we expand operations may strain our resources.    

We
expect to need to grow rapidly in order to support additional, larger, and potentially international, pivotal clinical trials
of our product candidates, which will place a significant strain on our financial, managerial and operational resources. In order
to achieve and manage growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our operational and financial management capabilities.
Moreover, we will need to increase staffing and to train, motivate and manage our employees. All of these activities will increase
our expenses and may require us to raise additional capital sooner than expected. Failure to manage growth effectively could materially
harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.  

We
may expand our business through the acquisition of rights to new product candidates that could disrupt our business, harm our
financial condition and may also dilute current stockholders  ownership interests in our company.    

Our
business strategy includes expanding our products and capabilities, and we may seek acquisitions of product candidates, antibodies
or technologies to do so. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including substantial cash expenditures; potentially dilutive issuance
of equity securities; incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify
at the time of acquisition; difficulties in assimilating acquired technologies or the operations of the acquired companies; diverting
our management s attention away from other business concerns; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct
experience; and the potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies.  

We
can make no assurances that any acquisition will result in short-term or long-term benefits to us. We may incorrectly judge the
value or worth of an acquired product, company or business. In addition, our future success would depend in part on our ability
to manage the rapid growth associated with some of these acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will be able to make the combination
of our business with that of acquired products, businesses or companies work or be successful. Furthermore, the development or
expansion of our business or any acquired products, business or companies may require a substantial capital investment by us.
We may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We may also seek to
raise funds by selling shares of our preferred or common stock, which could dilute each current stockholder s ownership
interest in the Company.  

Risks
Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock    

Because
we became public by means of a  reverse merger,  we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms.    

Additional
risks may exist since we became public through a  reverse merger.  Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may
not provide coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. We
cannot assure you that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of our company in the future.  

The
sale of securities by us in any equity or debt financing could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and have a material
adverse effect on our earnings.    

We believe we have enough
cash for at least the next 12 months to finance research and development and to cover our ongoing working capital needs. We have
financed our operations primarily through sales of stock. It is likely that during the next twelve months we will seek to raise
additional capital through the sales of stock in order to expand our level of operations to continue our research and development
efforts. 

Any sale of common stock
by us in a future public or private placement offering could result in dilution to the existing stockholders as a direct result
of our issuance of additional shares of our capital stock. In addition, our business strategy may include expansion through internal
growth or by establishing strategic relationships with targeted customers and vendor. In order to do so, or to finance the cost
of our other activities, we may issue additional equity securities that could dilute our stockholders  stock ownership.
We may also assume additional debt and incur impairment losses related to goodwill and other tangible assets if we acquire another
company and this could negatively impact our earnings and results of operations. 

Our
common stock has been considered a Penny Stock.    

During the fiscal year
2013 and through the third quarter of 2016 our common stock has or had been a penny stock, therefore, when our stock is considered
a penny stock trading in our securities may be subject to penny stock considerations. Broker-dealer practices in connection with
transactions in  penny stocks  are regulated by certain penny stock rules adopted by the SEC.  

Penny
stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities
exchanges or quoted on the NYSE MKT system). Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock
not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny
stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations
for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements
showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special
written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written
agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the
secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers
by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their
market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common
stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.  

Our
common stock is thinly traded, so you may be unable to sell at or near asking prices or at all if you need to sell your shares
to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.    

Trading
volume in our common stock has been limited at times. This may inhibit investment by major institutional investment funds, including
mutual funds, as well as individual investors. A higher volume trading market may never develop or be maintained. Active trading
markets generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders. Absence of an active trading
market reduces the liquidity of the shares traded there-in.  

Our
Common Stock is subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations.    

The
trading volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be extremely limited and sporadic. As a result of such trading
activity, the quoted price for our common stock on the NYSE MKT may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of its fair market
value.  

We
expect the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception
of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading volume
in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting the
Company s competitors or the Company itself. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities
issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.  

Because
we do not intend to pay dividends, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our Common Stock only if it appreciates in
value.    

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Preferred Stock or Common Stock. For the foreseeable future, it is expected
that earnings, if any, generated from our operations will be used to finance the growth of our business, and that no dividends
will be paid to holders of our Preferred Stock or Common Stock. As a result, the success of an investment in our Preferred Stock
or Common Stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our Preferred Stock or Common
Stock will appreciate in value.  

Certain
provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Delaware law make it more difficult for a third party to acquire
us and make a takeover more difficult to complete, even if such a transaction were in the stockholders  interest.    

Provisions
of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in
our control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their
shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions
could adversely affect the price of our stock. Among other things, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws:  

provide
    that the authorized number of directors may be changed by resolution of the board of directors;    

provide
    that all vacancies, including newly-created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative
    vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;    

divide
    the board of directors into three classes;    

provide
    that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as
    directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner, and meet specific requirements as
    to the form and content of a stockholder s notice;    

In
addition, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a public Delaware
corporation from engaging in a  business combination  with an  interested stockholder  for a period of
three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination
is approved in a prescribed manner. A  business combination  includes mergers, asset sales or other transactions resulting
in a financial benefit to the stockholder. An  interested stockholder  is a person who, together with affiliates and
associates, owns, or within three years, did own, 15% or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock. These provisions
may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in our control.  

Compliance
with the reporting requirements of federal securities laws can be expensive.    

We
are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, and the compliance
obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with
the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders are substantial. In addition, we will incur substantial expenses in connection
with the preparation of registration statements and related documents with respect to the registration of resale of the Common
Stock.  

Applicable
regulatory requirements, including those contained in and issued under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may make it difficult for us to
retain or attract qualified officers and directors, which could adversely affect the management of its business and its ability
to obtain or retain listing of our Common Stock.    

We
may be unable to attract and retain those qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for
effective management because of the rules and regulations that govern publicly held companies, including, but not limited to,
certifications required by principal executive officers. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has resulted in the issuance
of a series of related rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations by the SEC, as well as the
adoption of new and more stringent rules by the stock exchanges. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these changes
may deter qualified individuals from accepting roles as directors and executive officers.  

Further,
some of these changes heighten the requirements for board or committee membership, particularly with respect to an individual s
independence from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting matters. We may have difficulty attracting
and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors,
the management of our business and our ability to obtain or retain listing of our shares of Common Stock on any stock exchange
(assuming we elect to seek and are successful in obtaining such listing) could be adversely affected.  

If
we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or
detect fraud. Investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting and this may decrease the trading price of our Common
Stock.    

We
must maintain effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and detect fraud. As disclosed in this report,
we have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting because we did not have sufficient
written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting and we did not have effective controls over period end
financial disclosures and reporting processes. During 2014, our management remediated these previously identified material weaknesses.
In future periods, we may identify additional deficiencies in our system of internal controls over financial reporting that may
require remediation. There can be no assurances that any such future deficiencies identified may not be material weaknesses that
would be required to be reported in future periods. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls could harm our
operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any such loss of confidence would
have a negative effect on the trading price of our Common Stock.  

The
price of our common stock may become volatile, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.    

The
trading price of our Common Stock may be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:  

actual
    or anticipated variations in our operating results;   

announcements
    of developments by us or our competitors;   

the
    timing of IND and/or BLA approval, the completion and/or results of our clinical trials;   

regulatory
    actions regarding our products;   

announcements
    by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;   

adoption
    of new accounting standards affecting our industry;   

additions
    or departures of key personnel;   

introduction
    of new products by us or our competitors;   

sales
    of our Common Stock or other securities in the open market; and   

other
    events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.   

The
stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market
price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such a company. Litigation
initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management s attention
and Company resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.
