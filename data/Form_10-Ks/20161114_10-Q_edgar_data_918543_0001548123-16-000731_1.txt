The Castle Group, Inc. operates in the hotel and resort management industry in the State of Hawaii and in New Zealand under the trade name  Castle Resorts and Hotels.   The Company also has inactive operations in Saipan, Guam and Thailand.  The accounting and reporting policies of The Castle Group, Inc. (the  Company  or  Castle ) conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and practices within the hotel and resort management industry.       Principles of Consolidation       The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The Castle Group, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Hawaii Reservations Center Corp., HPR Advertising, Inc., Castle Resorts   Hotels, Inc., Castle Resorts   Hotels Thailand Ltd., NZ Castle Resorts and Hotels Limited (a New Zealand Corporation), and NZ Castle Resorts and Hotels  wholly-owned subsidiary, Mocles Holdings Limited (a New Zealand Corporation).  All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated in the condensed consolidated financial statements.       Note 1 Basis of Presentation       The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying interim financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation. The results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full-year period as the tourism industry that the Company relies on is highly seasonal.  It is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Castle s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  The Company s significant accounting policies are set forth in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.       Revenue Recognition        In accordance with ASC 605:  Revenue Recognition , the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price charged is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.       The Company recognizes revenue from the management of properties according to terms of its various management contracts.       The Company has two basic types of agreements, a  Gross Contract  and a  Net Contract .         Under a  Gross Contract,  the Company records revenue which is based on a percentage of the gross rental proceeds received from the rental of hotel or condominium units.   The Company pays the remaining gross rental proceeds to the owner of the rental unit.  The Company only records the difference between the gross rental proceeds and the amount paid to the owner of the rental unit as  Revenue attributed from properties.   Under this arrangement, the Company is responsible for all of the operating expenses for the hotel or condominium unit.  The Company records the expenses of operating the rental program at the property covered by the agreement. These expenses typically include housekeeping, food and beverage, maintenance, front desk, sales and marketing, advertising and all other operating costs at the property covered by the agreement and are recorded as  Attributed property expenses.          Under a  Net Contract,  the Company receives a management fee that is based on a percentage of the gross rental proceeds received from the rental of hotel or condominium units. Under this arrangement, the owner of the hotel or condominium unit is responsible for all of the operating expenses of the rental program covering the owner s unit, and in addition to the percentage of gross rental proceeds, the Company typically receives an incentive management fee based on the net operating profit of the covered property. Additionally, the Company employs on-site personnel to provide services such as housekeeping, maintenance and administration to property owners under its management agreements.  For such services the Company recognizes revenue in an amount equal to the expenses incurred.  Revenues received under the Net Contract are recorded as  Management and service revenue .  Under a Net Contract, the Company does not record the operating expenses of the property covered by the agreement, other than the personnel costs mentioned above.                 6             The difference between the Gross and Net contracts is that under a Gross Contract, all expenses, and therefore the ownership of any profits or the covering of any operating loss, belong to and are the responsibility of the Company.  Under a Net Contract, all expenses, and therefore the ownership of any profits or the covering of any operating loss belong to and are the responsibility of the owner of the property.         Under both types of agreements, revenues are recognized after services have been rendered. A liability is recognized for any deposits received for which services have not yet been rendered.         Note 2 New Accounting Pronouncements       From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date.  If not discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.        In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP.       The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures).  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which it will adopt the standard in 2018.       In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern. ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). It also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated. ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the accounting implication and does not believe the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have material impact on the consolidated financial statements, although there may be additional disclosures upon adoption.       In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any valuation allowance, as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. The guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has prospectively classified all of its deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2016 as a noncurrent asset.  Prior periods have not been adjusted or re-classified.       In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for capital and operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Additionally, this ASU will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, including qualitative and quantitative requirements.  For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on its financial statements.       In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net), which updates the new revenue standard by clarifying the principal versus agent implementation guidance, but does not change the core principle of the new standard.  The updates to the principal versus agent guidance (1) require an entity to determine whether it is a principal or an agent for each distinct good or service (or a distinct bundle of goods or services) to be provided to the customer; (2) illustrate how an entity that is a principal might apply the control principle to goods, services, or rights to services, when another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer; (3) clarify that the  purpose of certain specific control indicators is to support or assist in the assessment of whether an entity controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer, provide more specific guidance on how the                 7             indicators should be considered, and clarify that their relevance will vary depending on the facts and circumstances; and (4) revise existing examples and add two new ones to more clearly depict how the guidance should be applied.  The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-08 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (see ASU 2014-09 above). The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on its financial statements.       In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which introduces targeted amendments intended to simplify the accounting for stock compensation.  Specifically, the ASU requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.  The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur.  An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period.  That is, off balance sheet accounting for net operating losses stemming from excess tax benefits would no longer be required and instead such net operating losses would be recognized when they arise.  Existing net operating losses that are currently tracked off balance sheet would be recognized, net of a valuation allowance if required, through an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption.  Entities will no longer need to maintain and track an  APIC pool.   The ASU also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows.  In addition, the ASU elevates the statutory tax withholding threshold to qualify for equity classification up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction(s).  The ASU also clarifies that cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity.  The ASU provides an optional accounting policy election (with limited exceptions), to be applied on an entity-wide basis, to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (consistent with existing U.S. GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur.  The ASU is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period for which the financial statements have not been issued or made available to be issued.  Certain detailed transition provisions apply if an entity elects to early adopt.  The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on its financial statements.       Note 3 Income Taxes       Income tax expense reflects the expense or benefit only on the Company s domestic taxable income. Income tax expense and benefit from the Company s foreign operations are not recognized as they have been fully reserved.       Note 4 Long Term Debt       In June 2015, the Company received a term loan of $200,000 from a local bank which was used to fund upgrades to the property management and central reservation systems.  These outflows will be recouped by the Company through reimbursements from managed properties.  The loan is for a fixed interest rate of 5.875% with monthly payments of $3,855 and matures in June 2020.  The outstanding balance of this loan was $155,200 and $191,033 as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.       In April 2016, the Company received a loan of $40,178 to finance the purchase carts for one of its managed properties.  The loan is secured by the equipment purchased.  The loan is for a fixed interest rate of 4.43% with monthly payments of $749 and matures in March, 2021. The outstanding balance of this loan was $36,555 at September 30, 2016.       Note 5 Equity-Based Compensation       In April 2015, the Company issued 10,000 shares of restricted common stock as a hiring incentive to one of its employees.  The shares were assigned a value of $.20 per share or a total of $2,000 as compensation to the employee.  There have been no issuances of equity-based compensation during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.       Note 6 Basic and Dilutive Earnings Per Share       Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income (loss) (the numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period (denominator). Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares outstanding (if dilutive) during each period. Potential common shares include stock options, warrants, and restricted stock. The number of potential common shares outstanding relating to stock options, warrants, and restricted stock is computed using the treasury stock method.       As the Company incurred losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the potentially dilutive shares are anti-dilutive and are thus not added into the loss per share calculations. As of September 30, 2016, there were 368,333 potentially dilutive shares. During the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had warrants for shares totaling 400,000 outstanding at each period end, respectively,                 8             that were excluded from the computations of diluted net income per share because the exercise prices were greater than the market prices during the reporting periods.        Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.         Forward Looking Statements        Statements made in this Quarterly Report of the Castle Group, Inc. ( Castle  or the  Company ) which are not purely historical are forward-looking statements with respect to the goals, plan objectives, intentions, expectations, financial condition, results of operations, future performance and business of the Company, including, without limitation, (i) Castle s ability to raise capital, and (ii) statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words  may,   would,   could,   should,   expects,   projects,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   plans,   intends,   targets  or similar expressions.       Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which are beyond the Company s control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, including the following:  general economic or industry conditions, nationally and/or in the communities in which the Company conducts business; changes in the interest rate environment, legislation or regulatory requirements; conditions of the securities markets; the Company s ability to raise capital; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; financial or political instability; acts of war or terrorism; other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting Castle s operations, products, services and prices.       Factors that may affect forward-looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance, including the following:   changes in Company-wide strategies, which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which Castle is involved or chooses to invest; changes in U.S., global or regional economic conditions; changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including significant interest rate fluctuations, which may impede Castle s access to, or increase the cost of, external financing for its operations and investments; increased competitive pressures, both domestically and internationally; legal and regulatory developments, such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities; the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes in international tax laws or currency controls; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, labor disputes, which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations.  This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements are illustrative, but by no means exhaustive.  Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.        Overview         Principal products or services and their markets         General        Castle is a hospitality and hotel management company that prides itself on its ability to be both  Flexible and Focused,  which is the Company s operations motto.  Flexible, to meet the specific needs of property condo owners at the properties that it manages; and focused, in its efforts to achieve enhanced rental income and profitability for those owners.  Castle earns its revenues by providing several types of services to property owners including, hotel and resort management and operations; reservations staffing and operations; sales and marketing; and accounting. In addition, Castle provides design services to properties that are furnishing, refurnishing or remodeling, as well as, pre-opening technical services for new hotel and resort properties being planned or under construction.  Castle s revenues are derived primarily from two sources: (1) the rental of hotel rooms and condominium accommodations; and food and beverage sales at the properties it manages and; (2) fees paid for services it provides to property owners.  Castle also derives revenues from commissions and incentive payments, based on sales and performance criteria at each property.        Marketing Strategy        Most of our marketing efforts are focused towards acquiring and retaining guests for the properties we manage. Castle does not own any hotels or resorts; however, it has made real estate investments in the properties that it manages in Hilo, Hawaii and New Zealand. Marketing is done through a variety of distribution channels including direct internet sales, wholesalers, online and traditional travel agencies, and group tour operators.  Unlike many other hotel and resort operators, we do not market the properties we manage under the Castle brand.  Instead of emphasizing the  Flag  or  Chain  name, Castle s strategy is to promote the name and reputation of the individual properties under management as we believe that  one standard does not fit all.   We believe that this allows the consumer to better choose the specific type of vacation experience desired based upon the specific attributes of the property selected.       Our website (www.CastleResorts.com) offers state-of-the-art functionalities, user-friendly navigation, interactive features and rich content, while offering attractive rates and a travel booking engine that supports a dynamic pricing model which maximizes revenues for all of our properties under management.  We intend to continue to invest in optimizing our online presence directed specifically towards our own                 9             website, since revenue derived through our own branded website yields a higher margin utilizing retail rates. Castle supports its online presence with its own full service, reservation call center that provides a wide range of services from tour reservation processing and rooms control, to handling group bookings.  The reservation center electronically connects resort property inventory and rates to the four major Global Distribution Systems ( GDS ). This connectivity displays rates and inventory of Castle s properties to over 500,000 travel agents worldwide as well as Internet connectivity to over 1,200 travel websites worldwide.       For customer convenience, we offer direct to consumer online booking reservations of guest rooms at resort and condominium properties under contract and also vacation packages with attractions and activities related to our hotels and condominiums through Castle s interactive web site at www.CastleResorts.com.          Diversity        Castle has a diverse portfolio of properties located in desired island resort destinations throughout the Pacific Region. We represent hotels, resort condominiums, and lodging accommodations throughout Hawaii, and in New Zealand.          In Hawaii, Castle represents properties on all of the five major Hawaiian Islands of Oahu (Waikiki), Maui, Kauai, Molokai and Hawaii (Big Island).  This allows customers the option to island-hop, and provides Castle cross-selling opportunities.  Our Honolulu headquarters serves as the epicenter for our international operation in New Zealand.  Our diverse destinations offer customers the opportunity to discover new experiences and varying geographic areas and cultures.       Castle offers a wide range of accommodations at various price points from exclusive private villas, full-service all-suites hotels, oceanfront resort condominiums, to modestly priced hotels with hundreds of guest rooms.  Our collection of all-suites condominium resorts, hotels, lodges and vacation rentals allows customers to select the best accommodation to suit their individual style and budget.           Our ability to deliver consistent financial returns to our property owners demonstrates Castle s competency in managing and marketing a wide range of accommodations to our customers via multiple channels of distribution.          Brand Strategy        Castle does not brand the properties under its management.  Each property Castle manages is individually marketed in order to extract maximum value from its unique strengths.  Our strategy is that we do not promote Castle as a brand name but instead, we focus on our customers, the owners of the properties we manage.  As Castle does represent a diverse range of properties it represents, its brand strategy is that one size does not fit all.  The Castle brand stays in the background and our focus is on  marketing the uniqueness of each property, while satisfying the needs and expectations of our owners.  Each property we manage  maintains its own brand identity and personality, while utilizing the Castle advantage of our powerful marketing resources, channel distribution, resort management expertise, industry partnerships, and networks.       Castle s brand strategy is one of the areas that clearly differentiates us from the high profile branded hospitality companies. When a hotel owner or developer is considering contracting a large worldwide hospitality company for possible hotel management, there are several considerations that must be assessed.  With major worldwide brands, usually come the high costs that the owner must bear to sustain the expensive marketing and operational expense that the brand demands to offset their marketing costs. The owner may also have to make a substantial investment in the property in order to fit into the  cookie cutter  mold that the brand desires.  There are also some tangible differences from the guest s or customer s perspective as well.         Castle markets each property with its own independent brand identity and deploys customized marketing, operational and service programs to fit the specific demographics attracted to each of our properties.  Through our individual property brand building efforts, we begin the process of positioning each of our resort brands to our key market segments, niche targeted customers and distribution channels.       We do not flag our properties with the Castle name.  The advantages of doing so are several.  There is a high demand for the independent smaller boutique hotels and condominiums, as travelers favor a more individualized and unique travel experience.  This ongoing trend towards smaller, independent hotels, as opposed to the familiar chains, is not only occurring in Hawaii, but is also seen throughout the world tourism marketplace.  This increased demand is fueled by the following traveler s expectations:           Travelers seek individualized recognition, attention, and service.         Guests desire hotel and condominium accommodations that impart a sense of home and provide a unique, hospitable guest experience.         Customers demand differing quality and personalized service and providing this creates high customer loyalty and repeat business.                  10                   Customers seek Hawaii due to the feeling of  Ohana,  or family, experiencing the unique feeling of Aloha imparted by the people of Hawaii.          Marketing Programs and Promotions        Castle has implemented numerous marketing programs and promotions directed towards both the consumer and trade markets to generate incremental revenue and market loyalty for the individual properties.  We have developed a wide range of programs designed specifically to reflect the unique attributes of each of our resort properties, while also providing various incentives.  At any given time, we may have a number of ongoing marketing programs and promotions in place, some of which are seasonal to drive incremental room night revenues during valley or shoulder periods and some of which are ongoing throughout the year.        Growth Strategy        The majority of the properties presently managed by Castle are located within the state of Hawaii.  Significant opportunities for Castle to obtain additional contracts within the State of Hawaii are also available to us due to a myriad of factors that include sales of properties, foreclosures, underperformance, and dissatisfaction with the current management of our competitors.  In addition, Castle manages a property in New Zealand, and is keeping the option to strategically expand operations into Thailand, Saipan and Guam.  We believe that there are significant opportunities to expand Castle s operations both in the markets it currently serves, as well as other Pacific Basin and Asian vacation destinations.       As part of Castle s strategies to secure long term, multi-year management contracts, from time to time, we have found it advantageous to purchase or lease selected real property within a resort or condominium project.  This occurred in 2004, when we purchased the front desk, restaurant, bar, ballroom, board room, conference rooms, back of the house facilities and other areas (collectively the  Podium ) at our New Zealand property that are necessary for the hotel s operation.  Through our ownership of the Podium and a ten year management contract for the Spencer on Byron hotel, Castle is assured of ongoing revenues in future years from this property.  In January of 2015, we purchased the front desk unit at one of our condominium resort properties located on the island of Kauai.  This ownership solidifies our on-site presence at the property, allowing us to better service both our guests and the condominium owners that we represent.       In addition to seeking new hotel and resort condominium management contracts, we will continue to seek investment opportunities with hotel developers and owners.

Because such statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and  Plan of Operation.         Revenues        Total revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were $7,000,156 an 11% increase over the $6,318,448 reported for the three months ended September 30, 2015; for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total revenues were $19,376,730, a 9% increase over the $17,793,205 reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase is attributed to the signing of a property under a Net Contract in February of 2016, the Company achieving higher incentive fees from another property due to reaching pre-determined profit goals earlier in 2016 than in 2015, and an improvement in our foreign operations which includes favorable foreign exchange rates in 2016 when compared to 2015.        Revenues attributed from properties showed an increase of 7%, to $3,275,971, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3,048,075 for the three months ended September 30, 2015; for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues attributed from properties showed an increase of 6%, to $9,671,051 from $9,102,454 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase is again due to an improvement of our foreign operations as mentioned in the previous paragraph.  Management and service revenues increased by 14% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $3,723,485 in 2016 from $3,269,573 for the three months ended September 30, 2015; management and service revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $9,703,279, a 12% increase over the $8,688,151 reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 is due the signing of a property under a Net Contract in February of 2016, the                 11             Company achieving higher incentive fees from another property due to reaching pre-determined profit goals earlier in 2016 than in 2015, and an improvement in our foreign operations which includes favorable foreign exchange rates in 2016 when compared to 2015.        Other revenue was $700 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $800 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Other revenue was $2,400 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,600 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       The Company recorded investment income of $14,000 and $11,000, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which represents the Company s 7% share of the income from the limited liability company that owns one of the hotels managed by the Company.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported investment income of $42,000 and $79,000, respectively.        Expenses        Attributed property expenses are those expenses related to the management of the resort and condominium properties which are operated on a Gross Contract basis.  Attributed property expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 increased by 3%, from $2,869,177 to $2,958,553; attributed property expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 increased by 2%, from $8,415,285 to $8,602,538.  The increase is attributed to the acquisition of a Gross Contract in July 2015.        Compared to the prior year, payroll and office expenses increased by 8% from $3,203,476 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $3,472,295 for the three months ended September 30, 2016; payroll and office expenses increased by 8%, from $8,757,648 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $9,441,789 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The increase in cost is a result of additional payroll costs for Net Contracts which we acquired in February 2016 and July 2015 and the higher revenues experienced for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.       Administrative and general expenses increased by 58% from $98,596 to $155,608 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015; administrative and general expenses increased by 26% from $390,510 to $490,736 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015.  This increase was due to additional contracted labor costs related to converting our central reservations systems, higher Hawaii general excise tax expense related to the increase in our total revenue, and the production of collateral and other materials which will be used for marketing to prospective clients.        Depreciation        Our business is to provide services to our clients and as such does not require a great deal of capital expenditure for equipment or fixed assets.  As a result, depreciation expense was $69,457 and $50,923 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $191,027 and $164,148 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.        Equity Method Investment Income        In 2010 the Company acquired a 7% common series interest in the ownership of a hotel located in Hawaii. The Company received the interest in exchange for the Company s assistance to the buyers of the hotel in negotiating the purchase, performing due diligence work and other consulting services.   During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded investment income of $14,000 and $11,000, respectively, representing the Company s allocation of net income from its investment; for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded investment income of $42,000 and $79,000, respectively.   The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is due to the investment receiving a smaller dividend from its hotel during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year.        Interest Expense        Interest expense was $78,859 and $81,584 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $238,250 and $261,496 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   Included in interest expense is interest that is imputed on the mortgage note for our Podium located in New Zealand of $50,010 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $150,030 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.        Income Taxes        Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $112,274 and $25,080, respectively.  Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $190,020 and $31,319, respectively.  The increase in tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015 is due to an increase in the net taxable income reported by our domestic operations.                12                  Net (Loss) Income          Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $167,110 compared to $612 for the three months ended September 30, 2015; net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $264,370 compared to a net loss of $148,201 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The improvement in net income is attributed to the higher revenues for the properties under management and additional properties managed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as opposed to the prior year.        Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment        For consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, Castle translates their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the spot rate currently in effect as of the financial statement date, and results of operations are translated using the weighted average exchange rate for the period.       Translation adjustments from foreign exchange are included as a separate component of stockholders  equity. Changes in the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the consolidated entities outside of the United States due to foreign exchange changes are reflected as Foreign Currency Adjustments.  Foreign Currency Translation Loss totaled $1,362 compared to income of $19,353 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; foreign currency translation loss totaled $1,790 compared to income of $30,340 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.        Total Comprehensive (Loss) Income        Total comprehensive income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $165,748 as compared to $19,965 for the three months ended September 30, 2015; total comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $262,580 as compared to a loss of $117,861 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This is primarily a result of the changes in revenue and operating expenses, investment income, and foreign exchange rates noted above.        EBITDA        Earnings before Interest, Depreciation, Taxes and Amortization ( EBITDA ) reflects the Company s earnings without the effect of depreciation and amortization, interest income or expense, taxes, or certain other non-cash income or expense items.  EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. The presentation of the financial information, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, is not intended to be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Castle s management believes that in many ways EBITDA it is a good alternative indicator of the Company s financial performance.  It removes the effects of non-cash depreciation and amortization of assets, as well as the fluctuations of interest costs based on the Company s borrowing history and increases and decreases in tax expense brought about by changes in the provision for future tax effects rather than current income.  A comparison of EBITDA and net income is shown below.          Comparison of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA:             EBITDA totaled $427,700 as compared to an EBITDA of $158,199 for the three months ended September, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a 170% increase.  EBITDA totaled $883,667 and $308,762 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a 186% increase.  The increases in EBITDA are attributable to new contracts we have signed in both mid-2015 and early 2016, together with an overall increase in revenue and fees at the properties we represent.        Liquidity        Our primary sources of liquidity include available cash and cash equivalents, and borrowing under the credit facility which was secured in October 2008, consisting of a $300,000 line of credit.   As of September 30, 2016 the full amount of the line of credit was available to use. Additionally, our New Zealand subsidiary has an available NZ$300,000 (US$217,800) line of credit which was also fully available as of                 13             September 30, 2016. These facilities contain representations and warranties, conditions, covenants and events of default that are customary for this type of credit facility but do not contain financial covenants.  The Company is in compliance with the terms and conditions of these borrowing covenants.  We do not believe the limitations contained in the credit facility will, in the foreseeable future, adversely affect our ability to use the credit facility and execute our business plan.       In June 2015, the Company also received a term loan of $200,000 from a local bank which was used to pay the licensing fees for our new central reservations system.  The loan is for a fixed interest rate of 5.875% with monthly payments of $3,855 and matures in June 2020 and the Company is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the loan.  The balance of the loan as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $155,200 and $191,033, respectively.       In April 2016, the Company received a loan of $40,178 which was used to purchase equipment at one of the properties managed by the Company.  The loan is for a fixed interest rate of 4.43% with monthly payments of $749 and matures in March 2021.  The loan is secured by the equipment purchased and the Company is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the loan.  The balance of the loan as of September 30, 2016 was $35,555.       In January of 2015, the Chairman and CEO of the Company agreed to extend the due date of the $117,316 note due to him to December 31, 2017.  In addition to this extension, the Chairman and CEO agreed to forgive $14,000 of the accrued interest and the Company agreed to make monthly payments of $3,334 per month in order to fully amortize the loan through December 31, 2017.  We recorded the $14,000 forgiveness of debt as additional paid in capital.       Expected uses of cash in fiscal 2016 include funds required to support our operating activities, including continuing to selectively expand the number of properties under our management.  We are also in the installation phase of upgrading our central reservations system, front office systems and ecommerce systems which will allow us to better compete with the growing vacation rental industry, allowing guests to book their stays by a specific individual unit rather than by unit category.       We experienced net income of $264,370 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $148,201 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  We have established a trend of operating profitability in recent quarters as we reported positive EBITDA in eleven of our last twelve quarters, and positive net income for our last five fiscal years.  We anticipate stabilization of the current occupancy levels, together with a slight increase in average rate trends and levels for the properties currently under contract for the remainder of 2016 when compared to 2015.  We will continue our efforts to expand the number of properties under management through the remainder of 2016, which will increase the overall revenue stream in 2016. The specific impact of these additions on revenue depends on the timing of when and if new properties are added during the year.  We have implemented a number of revenue enhancement and cost saving programs that will improve our profitability and cash flow.  We project that we will continue to improve the overall profitability, cash flow, and working capital liquidity through 2016. This view is based on the following assumptions:         The maintaining of current occupancy levels in our Hawaii and New Zealand markets.         A continuation of increases in average daily rates at the properties we manage as compared to recent years.         Focus on increasing our properties room revenue through increased sales, advertising and marketing efforts.         Maximizing other sources of revenue from our guests.         Careful monitoring of our costs and expenses, providing the basis for improved operating margins throughout 2016.           Expansion of the number of properties under management, with emphasis on Hawaii and New Zealand.         A stabilization of the United States / New Zealand exchange rates.         The successful installation of our new reservations platform, allowing us to effectively penetrate the vacation rental market.       Our plans to manage our liquidity position in fiscal 2016 include:         Reducing our existing debt.         Accessing our available sources of debt if needed and seeking additional debt or equity financing at competitive rates.         Expenditures to replace and upgrade our existing technological equipment.                    14             We have considered the impact of the financial outlook on our liquidity and have performed an analysis of the key assumptions in our forecast such as sales, gross margin and expenses; an evaluation of our relationships with our travel partners and property owners; and an analysis of cash requirements, other working capital changes, capital expenditures and borrowing availability under our credit facility.  Based upon these analyses and evaluations, we expect that our anticipated sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our obligations without disposition of assets outside of the ordinary course of business or significant revisions of our planned operations through 2016 and our foreseeable future.        Off-balance sheet arrangements         None; not applicable.        Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates        A summary of our significant accounting policies and estimates is discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes to those policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Significant areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for income taxes, asset impairment and collectability of accounts receivable. We use historical and other information that we consider to be relevant to make these judgments and estimates. However, actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare our financial statements.        New Accounting Pronouncements        See discussion under Note 2,  New Accounting Pronouncements , to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for information on new accounting pronouncements.        Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.        Our profitability and financial condition are dependent upon the foreign exchange rates between the New Zealand dollar and the United States dollar.  Fluctuations in this exchange rate could have a material impact upon our profitability and financial condition.  In addition our New Zealand operations are operated under the laws and regulations of New Zealand and any changes in those laws could also have a material impact upon our operations, profitability and financial condition.        Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.         Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures        Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (and acting chief financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.       Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer (and acting chief financial officer) concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were, subject to the limitations noted above, effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules, regulations and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer (and acting chief financial officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.        Changes in internal control over financial reporting        Our management, with the participation of the chief executive officer (and acting chief financial officer), has concluded there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.                     15              PART II - OTHER INFORMATION          Item 1. Legal Proceedings.        None during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.         Item 1A. Risk Factors.        Not required to be enumerated by smaller reporting companies.        Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.         Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities        None during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.        Use of Proceeds of Registered Securities        No proceeds were received from the sale of registered securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.        Purchases of Equity Securities by Us and Affiliated Purchasers        None during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.         Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.        None; not applicable.         Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.        None, not applicable.         Item 5. Other Information.        None reported        Item 6. Exhibits.

 302 CERTIFICATION OF RICK WALL

Exhibit 31          Exhibit 31            CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO  SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002          I, Rick Wall, certify that:        1. I have reviewed this Form 10-Q of The Castle Group, Inc.;        2.
