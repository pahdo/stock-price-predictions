   Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

Note
1 - Organization and Nature of Business   

Endonovo
Therapeutics, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the  Company  or  ETI ) is primarily focused in the business of biomedical
research and development, particularly in regenerative medicine, which has included the development of its proprietary square
wave form device. The Company has historically been involved with intellectual property licensing and commercialization.  

Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation   

The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions
to Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required
by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 are
unaudited; however, in the opinion of management such interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments,
consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented.
The results of operations for the period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for future
interim periods or for the full year.  

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of ETI and IPR as of March 14, 2012; Aviva as of April 2,
2013; and WeHealAnimals as of November 16, 2013. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  

Going
Concern   

These
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for a period following
the date of these consolidated financial statements. The Company has raised approximately $2.1 million in debt and equity financing
for the period January 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016. The Company is raising additional capital through debt and equity securities
in order to continue the funding of its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company can raise enough funds or
generate sufficient revenues to pay its obligations as they become due, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying value of assets or liabilities as a result of this uncertainty.
To reduce the risk of not being able to continue as a going concern, management has initiated a private placement offering to
raise capital through the sale of its common stock and is seeking out profitable companies. Although, uncertainty exists as to
whether the Company will be able to generate enough cash from operations to fund the Company s working capital needs or
raise sufficient capital to meet the Company s obligations as they become due, no adjustments have been made to the carrying
value of assets or liabilities as a result of this uncertainty.  

Net
Income (Loss) per Share   

For
the nine month period ending September 30, 2016, the Company had 7,861,475 of weighted average common shares relating to the convertible
debt, under the if-converted method, however, these shares are not dilutive because the Company recorded a loss during this nine
month period.  

Recent
Accounting Standard Updates   

The
Company is not aware of any recently issued accounting pronouncements that when adopted will have a material effect on the Company s
financial position or results of its operations.

Note
2   Property, Plant and Equipment   

The
following is a summary of equipment, at cost, less accumulated depreciation at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Depreciation
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $11,876 and $10,920, respectively. Repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred while improvements are capitalized. Upon the sale, retirement or disposal of fixed assets, the
accounts are relieved of the cost and the related accumulated depreciation with any gain or loss recorded to the consolidated
statements of operations.  

Note
3 - Notes Payable and Long Term Loan   

Notes
Payable   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued, including the two notes discussed below related to the $1,000,000
financing, nine Convertible Notes ( Variable Notes ) with original terms ranging from one year to one year and nine
months with interest rates ranging from an add-on interest equal to 10% of the initial principal to annual interest rates of 6%
or 10%, and a variable conversion rate with a discounts ranging from 25% to 37% of the Company s common stock based on the
terms included in the Variable Notes. Some of the Variable Notes contain a prepayment option, which enables the Company to prepay
the note for a period of 0-180 days subsequent to issuance at a premium of 125%. In addition, 300,000 warrants were issued with
and to the holder of one of the Variable Notes. The gross amount of Variable Notes outstanding is $1,662,888 as of September 30,
2016.  

In
July 2016, the Company entered into a $1,000,000 financing comprising a Note Securities Purchase Agreement (NSPA ) and a
form of note to be issued by us on funding. The notes will be purchased at a 5.5% original issue discount, bear interest at 6%
per annum, are convertible into our common stock at a 25% discount to our lowest trading price for the 20 days prior to the conversion.
The holder will not affect any conversion which will result in its holding more than 4.99% of our common stock and has agreed
to limit the sales of our stock to 22.5% of the trading volume on the date of sale unless the trading volume exceeds $130,000
on a day, in which case the applicable trading volume limitation will be 30%. The form of note provides for certain penalties
for failure to timely deliver stock and contains other protective provisions for the holder. The note will be funded in full in
three tranches. As of September 30, 2016, two tranches amounting to $600,000 principal of the NSPA has been funded and the final
tranche will be funded upon the effectiveness of a registration statement covering the shares of our common stock issuable upon
conversion of the notes. The registration statement became effective subsequent to September 30, 2016.

The maturity dates on the notes payable are as follows:   

Derivative
Liability   

The
Company has issued Variable Debentures, which contained variable conversion rates based on unknown future prices of the Company s
common stock. This results in a conversion feature. The Company measures the conversion feature using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model using the following assumptions:  

Endonovo
Therapeutics, Inc. and Subsidiaries   

   Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   

The
time period over which the Company will be required to evaluate the fair value of the conversion feature is nine to twenty-four
months or conversion.  

The
assumptions used in determining fair value represent management s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties
and the application of management s judgment. As a result, if factors change, including changes in the market value of the
Company s common stock, managements  assessment or significant fluctuations in the volatility of the trading market
for the Company s common stock, the Company s fair value estimates could be materially different in the future.  

The
Company computes the fair value of the derivative liability at each reporting period and the change in the fair value is recorded
as non-cash expense or non-cash income. The key component in the value of the derivative liability is the Company s stock
price, which is subject to significant fluctuation and is not under its control. The resulting effect on net loss is therefore
subject to significant fluctuation and will continue to be so until the Company s Variable Debentures, which the convertible
feature is associated  

  with,
are converted into common stock or paid in full with cash. Assuming all other fair value inputs remain constant, the Company will
record non-cash expense when its stock price increases and non-cash income when its stock price decreases.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balances of the Derivative Liability are as follows:

The
Company has financed the purchase of an automobile. The maturity dates on the loan are as follows:  

Note
4 - Shareholders  Deficit   

Common
Stock   

The
Company has entered into consulting agreements with various consultants for service to be provided to the Company. The agreements
stipulate a monthly fee and a certain number of shares that the consultant vests in over the term of the contract. The consultant
is issued a prorated number of shares of common stock at the beginning of the contract, which the consultant earns over a three-month
period. At the anniversary of each quarter, the consultant is issued a new allotment of common stock during the first 3 years
of engagement. In accordance with ASC 505-50   Equity-Based Payment to Non-Employees, the common stock shares issued to
the consultant are valued upon their vesting, with interim estimates of value as appropriate during the vesting period. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 2,250,000 shares of common stock with a value of $880,800 related
to these consulting agreements.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company also issued 7,096,760 shares of common stock with a value of $1,410,573
for additional services and fees.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued pursuant to a private placement offering 5,851,987 shares of common
stock and the same number of warrants for cash of $948,750 and conversion of notes and accrued interest in the amount of $294,367.
The Company also issued 566,327 shares of common stock for cash of $107,079 and 3,934,279 shares of common stock for the conversion
of notes and accrued interest in the amount of $1,540,041.  

Also,
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 264,117 shares of common stock valued at $111,363 related
to the extension of outstanding notes and lock-up agreements.  

Equity
Line of Credit   

In
July 2016, the Company entered into a $9,000,000 Equity Line pursuant to an Equity Line Securities Purchase Agreement ( ELSPA )
which provides for a 3% origination fee and requires the investor to purchase shares of our stock which we will put to the investor
at a price equal to 75% of the lowest bid price for our stock during the 10 trading days preceding the put notice. Our draw downs,
or puts, have a minimum amount of $25,000 and a maximum amount of $500,000 and can be no more than 300% of the average trading
volume of our stock during the ten day pricing period of the put. The investor is not required to accept any put which will result
in their becoming a holder of more than 4.99% of our outstanding stock and its resales are subject to the same volume limitations
as resales of our stock issued on conversion of the notes. As a result of the restrictions and limitations on our right to put
our shares to the investor, we cannot give any assurance as to whether we will be able to raise $9,000,000 under the ELSPA. The
ELSPA has a term of 36 months, commencing thirty days after the effective date of the final Registration Statement, or when BCLP
has purchased $9,000,0000 of our stock, whichever is earlier. The Registration Statement went effective subsequent to September
30, 2016.

Series
AA Preferred Shares   

On
February 22, 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation,
as amended (the  Articles of Incorporation ), in the form of a Certificate of Designation that authorized the issuance
of up to one million (1,000,000) shares of a new series of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, designated  Series
AA Super Voting Preferred Stock,  for which the board of directors established the rights, preferences and limitations thereof.  

Each
holder of outstanding shares of Series AA Super Voting Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one hundred thousand (100,000) votes
for each share of Series AA Super Voting Preferred Stock held on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled
to vote at each meeting of stockholders of the Company. As of September 30, 2016, there were 1,000 shares of Series AA Preferred
stock outstanding.  

Warrants   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, in conjunction with the sale of common stock and issuance of notes, the Company issued
two and five-year common stock purchase warrants to acquire up to 6,151,977 shares of common stock. These warrants have exercise
prices ranging from $0.195 to $0.90 per share. The balance of all warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

Note
5   Related Party Transactions   

Two
officers and executives of the Company have entered into note payable agreements with the Company. $74,000 of principal
has been repaid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The balance of notes payable from related parties at September
30, 2016 is $170,000.  

Note
6   Fair Value Measurements   

Accounting
guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of
assets and liabilities using a hierarchy system, and defines required disclosures. It clarifies that fair value is the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the
market in which the reporting entity transacts business.  

Endonovo
Therapeutics, Inc. and Subsidiaries   

   Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   

The
Company s balance sheet contains derivative and warrant liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
The three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value is as follows:  

Level
1: uses quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2: uses observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.  

Level
3: uses unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.  

The
fair value of the Company s recorded derivative liability is determined based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated
by market data, which require a Level 3 classification. A Black-Scholes Option Valuation Model was used to determine the fair
value. The Company records derivative liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair
value recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operation.  

The
following table presents changes in the liabilities with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended September
30, 2016:  

Note

Overview   

Endonovo
Therapeutics, Inc. (the  Company  or  ETI ) operates in two business segments: (1) intellectual property
licensing and commercialization; and (2) biomedical research and development which has included development of its proprietary
square wave form device.  

Our
present primary focus is the development, patenting and regulatory approval of our biomedical proprietary technology.  

Going
Concern   

Our
independent registered auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion on our consolidated financial statements as
of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 that states that our ongoing losses and lack of resources causes substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

We
prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
(U.S. GAAP). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used
different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur
from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material
differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We
base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate
these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates,
which we discuss further below.  

Use
of estimates    

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and related interim statements of operations,
cash flows, and shareholders  deficits include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for
their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S.
GAAP ). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. The significant estimates were made for the fair value of common stock issued for
services, with notes payable arrangements in connection with note extension agreements, and as repayment for outstanding debts,
in estimating the useful life used for depreciation and amortization of our long-lived assets, in the valuation of the derivative
liability, and the valuation of deferred income tax assets. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management s estimates
and assumptions.  

Revenue
recognition    

The
Company recognizes revenue from its technology licensing and commercialization activities in accordance with paragraph 605-10-S99-1
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable
and earned.  

The
Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, (ii) the services have been rendered to the customer and accepted by the customer as completed pursuant
to Company s Licensing Agreements, (iii) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company has yet to realize any revenues
from its licensing agreements.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company is not aware of any recently issued accounting pronouncements that when adopted will have a material effect on the Company s
financial position or result of its operations.  

Results
of Operations    

Three
Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues    

We
had no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a refund of $400 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. We are in an early stage and our revenues will be small and null until a device or biological license receives FDA approval
or international research licensing develops. The growth of our business is dependent on successfully raising additional capital
to fund our growth.  

Operating
Expenses     

Our
operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $1,310,748 compared to $469,475 for the corresponding
period of the previous year. The operating expenses were comprised primarily from consulting and professional fees for the development
of our intellectual property and expenses related to being a public company. A significant portion of these fees were paid for
with the issuance of restricted shares of common stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, 4,513,514 shares of
common stock were issued for consulting services valued at $663,519 as compared to 1,270,000 shares of common stock being issued
for consulting services valued at $1,270, during the corresponding period of the previous year.  

Other
Income (Expense)    

Other
income (expense) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was expense of $908,093 compared to expense of $811,162 for the quarter
ended September 30, 2015. This change was due primarily to a change in valuation of our derivative liabilities and net of interest
expense resulting from the amortization of the discounts on notes payable. In addition, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of
debt of $42,507 for debt conversions and settlements during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $363,049
during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. We anticipate continued large fluctuations in other income (expense) as a result
of quarterly re-evaluation of these derivative liabilities.  

Nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues    

We
had no revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4,265 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We
are in an early stage and our revenues will be small and null until a device or biological license receives FDA approval or international
research licensing develops. The growth of our business is dependent on successfully raising additional capital to fund our growth.  

Operating
Expenses     

Our
operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $4,778,109 compared to $1,317,070 for the corresponding
period of the previous year. The operating expenses were comprised primarily from consulting and professional fees for the development
of our intellectual property and expenses related to being a public company. A significant portion of these fees were paid for
with the issuance of restricted shares of common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 9,346,760 shares of common
stock were issued for consulting services valued at $2,291,373 as compared to 5,519,286 shares of common stock being issued for
consulting services valued at $5,521, during the corresponding period of the previous year.  

Other
Income (Expense)    

Other
income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was income of $202,268 compared to expense of $923,723 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. This change was due primarily to a change in valuation of our derivative liabilities and net
of interest expense resulting from the amortization of the discounts on notes payable. In addition, we incurred interest expense
on the issuance of debt and a loss on extinguishment of debt for debt conversions and settlements during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. We anticipate continued large fluctuations in other income (expense) as a result of quarterly re-evaluation
of these derivative liabilities.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources     

Since
inception and through September 30, 2016, the Company has raised approximately $5.0 million in equity and debt transactions. These
funds have been used to commence the operations of the Company to acquire and begin the development of its intellectual property
portfolio. These activities include attending trade shows and corporate development. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for the twelve month period following the date of these condensed
consolidated financial statements. The Company has incurred substantial losses since inception. Its current liabilities exceed
its current assets and available cash is not sufficient to fund expected future operations. The Company is raising additional
capital through debt and equity securities in order to continue the funding of its operations. However, there is no assurance
that the Company can raise enough funds or generate sufficient revenues to pay its obligations as they become due, which raises
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. To reduce the risk of not being able to continue as a going
concern, management is increasing the value of its intellectual property through regulatory approvals and obtaining additional
patent rights and has initiated a private placement offering to raise capital through the sale of its common stock. Although,
uncertainty exists as to whether the Company will be able generate enough cash from operations to fund the Company s working
capital needs or raise sufficient capital to meet the Company s obligations as they become due, no adjustments have been
made to the carrying value of assets or liabilities as a result of this uncertainty. Our cash on hand at September 30, 2016 was
approximately $94,675. This will be insufficient to fund operations if additional capital is not raised. The Company raised an
aggregate of approximately $2.2 million through the sale of equity and debt securities during the nine months ended September
30, 2016.  

The
Company is not aware of any recently issued accounting pronouncements that when adopted will have a material effect on the Company s
financial position or result of its operation.

We
are a Smaller Reporting Company and are not required to provide the information under this item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosure
of controls and procedures.    

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports,
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based
in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in
a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.  

As
required by the SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at
the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below.  

In
light of the material weaknesses described below, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure
our financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, we believe that
the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  

A
material weakness is a control deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing
Standard No. 2) or combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement
of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has identified the following two material
weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that as of September 30, 2016 our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective at the reasonable assurance level:  

1.
We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and
procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted
represented a material weakness.  

2.
We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size
and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to
the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed
by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our
disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.  

To
address these material weaknesses, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial
statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the periods presented.  

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting.   

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

We
are not currently involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government
agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our
subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our
subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse
effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, several lenders have commenced litigation against us, which is in the early stages. We
anticipate that these matters will be settled, however, if a settlement cannot be reached, we will vigorously defend these matters
and we do not believe that there will be any material adverse effect as a result thereof, but there is always uncertainty in any
litigation and a result cannot be guaranteed.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors.   

We
are a Smaller Reporting Company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act) and are not required to provide the information
under this item.  

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   

The
above issuances of securities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 were exempt from registration pursuant to Section
4(2), and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. These securities qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act since the issuance securities by us did not involve a public offering. The offering was not a  public
offering  as defined in Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal, size of the offering,
manner of the offering and number of securities offered. We did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of securities
to a high number of investors. In addition, these stockholders had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2)
since they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such securities are restricted pursuant to
Rule 144 of the Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these securities would not be immediately redistributed into the
market and therefore not be part of a  public offering.  Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the
requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for this transaction.
