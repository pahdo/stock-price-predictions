Note
1 - Organization and Operations   

Jerrick Media Holdings, Inc. (formerly Great
Plains Holdings, Inc.) (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on December 30, 1999
under the name LILM, Inc. The Company changed its name on December 3, 2013 as part of its plans to diversify its business through
the acquisition and operation of commercial real estate, including but not limited to self-storage facilities, apartment buildings,
55+ senior manufactured homes communities, and other income producing properties. Historically, the Company had principally engaged
in manufacture and marketing of the LiL Marc urinal used in the training of young boys, but then changed its focus to residential
and commercial rental real estate as well as exploring other business opportunities. 

On
February 5, 2016, Great Plains Holdings, Inc. a Nevada corporation ( GTPH , or the  Company ), GPH Merger
Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of GTPH ( Merger Sub ), and Jerrick Ventures, Inc., a
privately-held Nevada corporation headquartered in New Jersey ( Jerrick ), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the  Agreement ) pursuant to which the Merger Sub was merged with and into Jerrick, with Jerrick surviving as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of GTPH (the  Merger ). The transaction (the  Closing ) took place on February 5, 2016 (the
 Closing Date ). The Company acquired, through a reverse triangular merger, all of the outstanding capital stock of
Jerrick in exchange for issuing Jerrick s shareholders (the  Jerrick Shareholders ), pro-rata, a total of 28,500,000
shares of the Company s common stock. GTPH shall assume 33,414.89 shares of Jerrick s Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock (the  Series A Preferred ) and 8,063.33 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series B
Preferred ) and file the appropriate certificates of designation to reflect the rights, preferences and privileges of the
Jerrick s Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred. Jerrick shareholders that hold either Series A Preferred or Series
B Preferred will be able to exchange such shares for the equivalent in GTPH on a one for one basis. Additionally, GTPH shall assume
12,391,667 outstanding common stock purchase warrants of Jerrick such that each Jerrick shareholder that holds a warrant to purchase
shares of Jerrick common stock will by virtue of the Merger, be able to purchase the equivalent number of shares of GTPH Common
Stock under the same terms and conditions.  

In
connection with the Merger, on February 5, 2016, the Company and Kent Campbell entered into a Spin-Off Agreement (the  Spin-Off
Agreement ), pursuant to which Mr. Campbell purchased from the Company (i) all of the Company s interest in Ashland
Holdings, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and (ii) all of the Company s interest in Lil Marc, Inc., a Utah corporation,
in exchange for the cancellation of 781,818 shares of the Parent Company s Common Stock held by Mr. Campbell. In addition,
Mr. Campbell assumed all debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company existing prior to the Merger, pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Spin-Off Agreement.  

On
February 5, 2016 and in conjunction with the Merger, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Kent Campbell, Denis
Espinoza and Sarah Campbell (the  Exchange Agreement ). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, (i) Kent Campbell cancelled
363,636 shares of the Company s common stock, 6,000 shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock and 10,000 shares
of the Company s Series B Preferred Stock in exchange for 1,648,881 shares of the Company s Series D Preferred Stock,
(ii) Denis Espinoza cancelled 58,951 shares of the Company s common stock and 4,000 shares of the Company s Series
A Preferred Stock in exchange for 265,676 shares of the Company s Series D Preferred Stock, and (iii) Sarah Campbell cancelled
21,818 shares of the Company s common stock in exchange for 98,933 shares of the Company s Series D Preferred Stock.  

In
connection with the Statutory Merger, the Company changed its name to Jerrick Media Holdings, Inc.  

Jerrick was incorporated on November 24, 2014
under the laws of the State of Nevada.  Jerrick develops digital transmedia content, including videos,
imagery, articles, e-books, as well as traditional film and television, for each brand in its portfolio.  

Jerrick Ventures, LLC ( Jerrick LLC )
was incorporated in Delaware in 2013. On December 1, 2014, Jerrick LLC entered into a share exchange agreement whereby the members
of Jerrick LLC exchanged all of their membership interests in Jerrick LLC for Common Stock in Ventures (the  Jerrick Share
Exchange ). As result of the Jerrick Share Exchange, Jerrick LLC became the operating subsidiary of Jerrick. 

The Merger is being accounted for as a  Reverse
Business Combination,  and Jerrick is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the merger. Consequently, the assets and liabilities
and the historical operations that will be reflected in the financial statements prior to the Reverse Business Combination will
be those of Jerrick, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the Merger will include the assets and liabilities
of Jerrick, historical operations of Jerrick and combined operations of Jerrick and Jerrick Media Holdings, Inc. from the Closing
Date of the Merger. 

The Reverse Business Combination will be treated
as a recapitalization of the Company for financial accounting purposes. The historical financial statements of Predecessor before
the Reverse Business Combination will be replaced with the historical financial statements of Jerrick before the Reverse Business
Combination in all future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the   SEC  ). 

Note
2 - Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices   

Management
of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting
policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal
of the Company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company s
significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles.  

Basis
of Presentation    

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (  US GAAP  ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (  SEC  ).  

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting solely of normal
recurring items, which in the opinion of management are necessary to fairly state the financial position of the Company and the
results of its operations for the periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Information Report on Form 8K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015
filed with the SEC on August 4, 2016. The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read
or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional disclosure
needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure, which would substantially
duplicate the disclosure contained in the Company s Form 8K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015 has been omitted. The
results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending December
31, 2016 or any other period.  

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  

Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and
judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact
of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Company s critical accounting estimates
and assumptions affecting the financial statements were:  

(i)  
       Assumption
    as a going concern : Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity
    of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.   

(ii)  
       Fair
    value of long-lived assets:  Fair value is generally determined using the asset s expected future discounted cash
    flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined
    remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated
    over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives. The Company considers the following to be some examples of important
    indicators that may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant under-performance or losses of assets relative to expected
    historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant changes in the manner or use of assets or in the Company s
    overall strategy with respect to the manner or use of the acquired assets or changes in the Company s overall business
    strategy; (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iv) increased competitive pressures; (v) a significant
    decline in the Company s stock price for a sustained period of time; and (vi) regulatory changes. The Company evaluates
    acquired assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events.   

(iii)  
       Valuation
    allowance for deferred tax assets : Management assumes that the realization of the Company s net deferred tax assets
    resulting from its net operating loss ( NOL ) carry forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be
    offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of
    the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company
    has incurred recurring losses, (b) general economic conditions, and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its
    daily operations by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.   

(iv)  
       Estimates
    and assumptions used in valuation of equity instruments:  Management estimates expected term of share options and similar
    instruments, expected volatility of the Company s common shares and the method used to estimate it, expected annual
    rate of quarterly dividends, and risk free rate(s) to value share options and similar instruments.   

These
significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached
to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.  

Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  

Management
regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes
in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those
estimates are adjusted accordingly.   

Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  

Principles
of consolidation    

The
Company applies the guidance of Topic 810   Consolidation   of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (  ASC  )
to determine whether and how to consolidate another entity. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-10, all majority-owned subsidiaries all
entities in which a parent has a controlling financial interest shall be consolidated except (1) when control does not rest
with the parent, the majority owner; (2) if the parent is a broker-dealer within the scope of Topic 940 and control is likely
to be temporary; (3) consolidation by an investment company within the scope of Topic 946 of a non-investment-company investee.
Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 810-10-15-8, the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting
interest, and, therefore, as a general rule ownership by one reporting entity, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent
of the outstanding voting shares of another entity is a condition pointing toward consolidation. The power to control may also
exist with a lesser percentage of ownership, for example, by contract, lease, agreement with other stockholders, or by court decree.
The Company consolidates all less-than-majority-owned subsidiaries, if any, in which the parent s power to control exists.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial
instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements
and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of
fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:  

Level
    1  
         
      Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   

Level
    2  
         
      Pricing
    inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
    as of the reporting date.   

Level
    3  
         
      Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.  

The
carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities and accrued liquidating damages approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.  

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of
competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply
that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm s-length transactions
unless such representations can be substantiated.  

Fair
Value of Non-Financial Assets or Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis    

The
Company s non-financial assets include inventory. The Company identifies potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by
evaluating turn rates, inventory levels and other factors. Excess quantities are identified through evaluation of inventory aging,
review of inventory turns and historical sales experiences. The Company provides lower of cost or market reserves for such identified
excess and slow-moving inventories. The Company establishes a reserve for inventory shrinkage, if any, based on the historical
results of physical inventory cycle counts.  

Cash
Equivalents    

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  

Inventories    

Inventory
Valuation    

The
Company values inventory, entirely consisting of finished goods, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first-in
and first-out ( FIFO ) method. The Company reduces inventory for the diminution of value, resulting from product obsolescence,
damage or other issues affecting marketability, equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market
value. Factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include: (i) current sales data and historical return rates,
(ii) estimates of future demand, and (iii) competitive pricing pressures.  

Inventory
Obsolescence and Markdowns    

The
Company evaluates its current level of inventory considering historical sales and other factors and, based on this evaluation,
classify inventory markdowns in the income statement as a component of cost of goods sold pursuant to Paragraph 420-10-S99 of
the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to adjust inventory to net realizable value. These markdowns are estimates, which could
vary significantly from actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer demand or competition differ from expectations.  

The
Company recorded a markdown of $0 and $21,861 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 due to slow moving inventory.  

There
was no lower of cost or market adjustments for the reporting period ended September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.    

Property
and Equipment    

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs
are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account their respective
estimated residual values) over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:  

Estimated Useful  Life (Years)  

Computer equipment and software    
     3  

Furniture and fixture    
     5  

Upon
sale or retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.  

Investments
- Cost Method, Equity Method and Joint Venture    

The
Company accounts for marketable debt and equity securities, available for sale, in accordance with sub-topic 320-10 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification ( Sub-topic 320-10 ).  

Pursuant
to Paragraph 320-10-35-1, investments in debt securities that are classified as available for sale and equity securities that
have readily determinable fair values that are classified as available for sale shall be measured subsequently at fair value in
the consolidated balance sheets at each balance sheet date. Unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities
(including those classified as current assets) shall be excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income until
realized except an available-for-sale security that is designated as being hedged in a fair value hedge, from which all or a portion
of the unrealized holding gain and loss of shall be recognized in earnings during the period of the hedge, pursuant to paragraphs
815-25-35-1 through 815-25-35-4.  

The
Company follows Paragraphs 320-10-35-17 through 320-10-35-34E and assess whether an investment is impaired in each reporting period.
An investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost. Impairment indicators include, but are not
limited to the following: a. a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business
prospects of the investee; b. a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee;
c. a significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee
operates; d. a bona fide offer to purchase (whether solicited or unsolicited), an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed
auction process for the same or similar security for an amount less than the cost of the investment; e. factors that raise significant
concerns about the investee's ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations, working capital
deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or debt covenants. If the fair value of an investment is less
than its cost basis at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which impairment is assessed, the impairment is either
temporary or other than temporary. Pursuant to Paragraph 320-10-35-34, if it is determined that the impairment is other than temporary,
then an impairment loss shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s cost and
its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made. The measurement of the impairment
shall not include partial recoveries after the balance sheet date. The fair value of the investment would then become the new
basis of the investment and shall not be adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. For presentation purpose, the entity
shall present the total other-than-temporary impairment in the statement of earnings with an offset for the amount of the total
other-than-temporary impairment that is recognized in other comprehensive income, in accordance with paragraph 320-10-35-34D,
if any, pursuant to Paragraph 320-10-45-8A; and separately present, in the financial statement in which the components of accumulated
other comprehensive income are reported, amounts recognized therein related to held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt securities
for which a portion of an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized in earnings pursuant to Paragraph 320-10-45-9A.
Pursuant to Paragraphs 320-10-35-36 and 37 the entire change in the fair value of foreign-currency-denominated available-for-sale
debt securities shall be reported in other comprehensive income and An entity holding a foreign-currency-denominated available-for-sale
debt security is required to consider, among other things, changes in market interest rates and foreign exchange rates since acquisition
in determining whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. Pursuant to FASB ASC Paragraph 320-10-50-2, the entity
shall disclose all of the following by major security type as of each date for which a statement of financial position is presented:
a. cost basis (net of amortization of debt discount for debt securities), aggregate fair value, total other-than-temporary impairment
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income; b. Total gains for securities with net gains in accumulated other comprehensive
income; c. Total losses for securities with net losses in accumulated other comprehensive income; and d. Information about the
contractual maturities of those securities as of the date of the most recent statement of financial position presented.  

On
January 2, 2013, the Company purchased a minority interest in a business for proceeds of $83,333. The interest is accounted for
under the cost method. The Company tests the carrying value annually for impairment. As of September 30, 2016, no impairment charges
have been recognized on the minority interest.  

Related
Parties    

The
Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure
of related party transactions.    

Pursuant
to Section 850-10-20 FASB Accounting Standards, the related parties include (a.) affiliates of the Company ( Affiliate 
means, with respect to any specified Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,
controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such Person, as such terms are used in and construed under Rule 405
under the Securities Act); (b.) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election
of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825 10 15 FASB Accounting Standards, to
be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; (c.) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing
trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; (d.) principal owners of the Company and members of their immediate
families; (e.) management of the Company and members of their immediate families; (f.) other parties with which the Company may
deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that
one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and (g.) other parties that
can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest
in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties
might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.  

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 850-10-50-1 and 50-5 financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions,
other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. The disclosures
shall include: (a.) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; (b.) a description of the transactions, including transactions
to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such
other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; (c.) the
dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change
in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and (d.) amounts due from or to related parties
as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement. Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the
related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
representations can be substantiated.  

Commitments
and Contingencies    

The
Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company
but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities,
and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings
that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived
merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected
to be sought therein.  

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s consolidated financial statements. If the
assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but
cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable
and material, would be disclosed.  

Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would
be disclosed.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will
recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned
when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped
or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is
reasonably assured.  

Stock-Based
Compensation for Obtaining Employee Services    

The
Company accounts for share-based payment transactions issued to employees under the guidance of the Topic 718   Compensation Stock
Compensation   of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC Topic 718 ).  

Pursuant
to ASC Section 718-10-20 an employee is an individual over whom the grantor of a share-based compensation award exercises or has
the right to exercise sufficient control to establish an employer-employee relationship based on common law as illustrated in
case law and currently under U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) Revenue Ruling 87-41. A non-employee director does
not satisfy this definition of employee. Nevertheless, non-employee directors acting in their role as members of a board of directors
are treated as employees if those directors were elected by the employer s shareholders or appointed to a board position
that will be filled by shareholder election when the existing term expires. However, that requirement applies only to awards granted
to non-employee directors for their services as directors. Awards granted to non-employee directors for other services shall be
accounted for as awards to non-employees.    

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 718-10-30-2 and 718-10-30-3 a share-based payment transaction with employees shall be measured based on the
fair value of the equity instruments issued and an entity shall account for the compensation cost from share-based payment transactions
with employees in accordance with the fair value-based method, i.e., the cost of services received from employees in exchange
for awards of share-based compensation generally shall be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments
issued or the fair value of the liabilities incurred/settled.  

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 718-10-30-6 and 718-10-30-9 the measurement objective for equity instruments awarded to employees is to estimate
the fair value at the grant date of the equity instruments that the entity is obligated to issue when employees have rendered
the requisite service and satisfied any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments (for example,
to exercise share options). That estimate is based on the share price and other pertinent factors, such as expected volatility,
at the grant date. As such, the fair value of an equity share option or similar instrument shall be estimated using a valuation
technique such as an option pricing model. For this purpose, a similar instrument is one whose fair value differs from its intrinsic
value, that is, an instrument that has time value.   

If
the Company s common shares are traded in one of the national exchanges, the grant-date share price of the Company s
common stock will be used to measure the fair value of the common shares issued, however, if the Company s common shares
are thinly traded the use of share prices established in its most recent private placement memorandum ( PPM ), or
weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as such shares
could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.  

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraph 718-10-55-21 if an observable market price is not available for a share option or similar instrument with the
same or similar terms and conditions, an entity shall estimate the fair value of that instrument using a valuation technique or
model that meets the requirements in paragraph 718-10-55-11 and takes into account, at a minimum, all of the following factors:  

a.  
      The
    exercise price of the option.   

b.  
      The
    expected term of the option, taking into account both the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees 
    expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior: The expected life of options and similar instruments represents
    the period of time the option and/or warrant are expected to be outstanding. Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1, it may be
    appropriate to use the  simplified method  ,  i.e., expected term = ((vesting term + original contractual term) / 2)
     , if (i) A company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate
    expected term due to the limited period of time its equity shares have been publicly traded; (ii) A company significantly
    changes the terms of its share option grants or the types of employees that receive share option grants such that its historical
    exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term; or (iii) A company has or expects
    to have significant structural changes in its business such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable
    basis upon which to estimate expected term. The Company uses the simplified method to calculate expected term of share options
    and similar instruments as the company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon
    which to estimate expected term.   

c.  
      The
    current price of the underlying share.   

d.  
      The
    expected volatility of the price of the underlying share for the expected term of the option. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 718-10-55-25
    a newly publicly traded entity might base expectations about future volatility on the average volatilities of similar entities
    for an appropriate period following their going public. A nonpublic entity might base its expected volatility on the average
    volatilities of otherwise similar public entities. For purposes of identifying otherwise similar entities, an entity would
    likely consider characteristics such as industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage. Because of the effects
    of diversification that are present in an industry sector index, the volatility of an index should not be substituted for
    the average of volatilities of otherwise similar entities in a fair value measurement. Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1
    if shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate
    than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially
    inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market. The Company
    uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected term of the share options or similar
    instruments as its expected volatility.   

e.  
      The
    expected dividends on the underlying share for the expected term of the option. The expected dividend yield is based on the
    Company s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the expected term
    of the share options and similar instruments.   

f.  
      The
    risk-free interest rate(s) for the expected term of the option. Pursuant to ASC 718-10-55-28 a U.S. entity issuing an option
    on its own shares must use as the risk-free interest rates the implied yields currently available from the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
    yield curve over the contractual term of the option if the entity is using a lattice model incorporating the option s
    contractual term. If the entity is using a closed-form model, the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available
    on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the assumption in the model.   

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 718-10-30-11 and 718-10-30-17 a restriction that stems from the forfeitability of instruments to which employees
have not yet earned the right, such as the inability either to exercise a non-vested equity share option or to sell non-vested
shares, is not reflected in estimating the fair value of the related instruments at the grant date. Instead, those restrictions
are taken into account by recognizing compensation cost only for awards for which employees render the requisite service and a
non-vested equity share or non-vested equity share unit awarded to an employee shall be measured at its fair value as if it were
vested and issued on the grant date.  

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 718-10-35-2 and 718-10-35-3 the compensation cost for an award of share-based employee compensation classified
as equity shall be recognized over the requisite service period, with a corresponding credit to equity (generally, paid-in capital).
The requisite service period is the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award, which
often is the vesting period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized at the end of the requisite service period for an
award of share-based compensation shall be based on the number of instruments for which the requisite service has been rendered
(that is, for which the requisite service period has been completed). An entity shall base initial accruals of compensation cost
on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. That estimate shall be revised
if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of instruments is likely to differ from previous estimates. The cumulative
effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected
to be or has been rendered shall be recognized in compensation cost in the period of the change. Previously recognized compensation
cost shall not be reversed if an employee share option (or share unit) for which the requisite service has been rendered expires
unexercised (or unconverted).  

Under
the requirement of ASC Paragraph 718-10-35-8 the Company made a policy decision to recognize compensation cost for an award with
only service conditions that has a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
entire award.   

Equity
Instruments Issued to Parties Other Than Employees for Acquiring Goods or Services    

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under the guidance
of Sub-topic 505-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Sub-topic 505-50 ).  

Pursuant
to ASC paragraphs 505-50-25-6 and 505-50-25-7, a grantor shall recognize the goods acquired or services received in a share-based
payment transaction when it obtains the goods or as services are received. A grantor may need to recognize an asset before it
actually receives goods or services if it first exchanges share-based payment for an enforceable right to receive those goods
or services. Nevertheless, the goods or services themselves are not recognized before they are received. If fully vested, nonforfeitable
equity instruments are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services (no specific performance
is required by the grantee to retain those equity instruments), then, because of the elimination of any obligation on the part
of the counterparty to earn the equity instruments, a measurement date has been reached. A grantor shall recognize the equity
instruments when they are issued (in most cases, when the agreement is entered into). Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-45-1, a
grantor may conclude that an asset (other than a note or a receivable) has been received in return for fully vested, nonforfeitable
equity instruments that are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services (and no specific
performance is required by the grantee in order to retain those equity instruments). Such an asset shall not be displayed as contra-equity
by the grantor of the equity instruments. The transferability (or lack thereof) of the equity instruments shall not affect the
balance sheet display of the asset. This guidance is limited to transactions in which equity instruments are transferred to other
than employees in exchange for goods or services.  

Pursuant
to Paragraphs 505-50-25-8 and 505-50-25-9, an entity may grant fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments that are exercisable
by the grantee only after a specified period of time if the terms of the agreement provide for earlier exercisability if the grantee
achieves specified performance conditions. Any measured cost of the transaction shall be recognized in the same period(s) and
in the same manner as if the entity had paid cash for the goods or services or used cash rebates as a sales discount instead of
paying with, or using, the equity instruments. A recognized asset, expense, or sales discount shall not be reversed if a stock
option that the counterparty has the right to exercise expires unexercised.    

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraphs 505-50-30-2 and 505-50-30-11 share-based payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair
value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
The issuer shall measure the fair value of the equity instruments in these transactions using the stock price and other measurement
assumptions as of the earlier of the following dates, referred to as the measurement date: (a) The date at which a commitment
for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached (a performance commitment); or (b) The date at which
the counterparty's performance is complete. If the Company s common shares are traded in one of the national exchanges the
grant-date share price of the Company s common stock will be used to measure the fair value of the common shares issued;
however, if the Company s common shares are thinly traded the use of share prices established in the Company s most
recent private placement memorandum ( PPM ), or weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate
than the use of daily price observations as such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid
and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.  

Pursuant
to ASC Paragraph 718-10-55-21 if an observable market price is not available for a share option or similar instrument with the
same or similar terms and conditions, an entity shall estimate the fair value of that instrument using a valuation technique or
model that meets the requirements in paragraph 718-10-55-11 and takes into account, at a minimum, all of the following factors:  

a.  
      The
    exercise price of the option.   

b.  
      The
    expected term of the option, taking into account both the contractual term of the option and the effects of employees 
    expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior: Pursuant to Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(i) of the FASB
    Accounting Standards Codification the expected term of share options and similar instruments represents the period of time
    the options and similar instruments are expected to be outstanding taking into consideration of the contractual term of the
    instruments and holder s expected exercise behavior into the fair value (or calculated value) of the instruments. The
    Company uses historical data to estimate holder s expected exercise behavior. If the Company is a newly formed corporation
    or shares of the Company are thinly traded the contractual term of the share options and similar instruments is used as the
    expected term of share options and similar instruments as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to
    provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.   

c.  
      The
    current price of the underlying share.   

d.  
      The
    expected volatility of the price of the underlying share for the expected term of the option. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 718-10-55-25
    a newly publicly traded entity might base expectations about future volatility on the average volatilities of similar entities
    for an appropriate period following their going public. A nonpublic entity might base its expected volatility on the average
    volatilities of otherwise similar public entities. For purposes of identifying otherwise similar entities, an entity would
    likely consider characteristics such as industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage. Because of the effects
    of diversification that are present in an industry sector index, the volatility of an index should not be substituted for
    the average of volatilities of otherwise similar entities in a fair value measurement. Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1
    if shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate
    than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially
    inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market. The Company
    uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected term of the share options or similar
    instruments as its expected volatility.   

e.  
      The
    expected dividends on the underlying share for the expected term of the option. The expected dividend yield is based on the
    Company s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the expected term
    of the share options and similar instruments.   

f.  
      The
    risk-free interest rate(s) for the expected term of the option. Pursuant to ASC 718-10-55-28 a U.S. entity issuing an option
    on its own shares must use as the risk-free interest rates the implied yields currently available from the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
    yield curve over the contractual term of the option if the entity is using a lattice model incorporating the option s
    contractual term. If the entity is using a closed-form model, the risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available
    on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the assumption in the model.   

Pursuant
to ASC paragraph 505-50-S99-1, if the Company receives a right to receive future services in exchange for unvested, forfeitable
equity instruments, those equity instruments are treated as unissued for accounting purposes until the future services are received
(that is, the instruments are not considered issued until they vest). Consequently, there would be no recognition at the measurement
date and no entry should be recorded.    

Deferred
Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision    

The
Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets
and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets
will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.  

The
Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Section 740-10-25 ). Section 740-10-25
addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the
financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if
it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based
on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section
740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim
periods and requires increased disclosures.  

The
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability
of deferred tax assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.  

Management
makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous
estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in
these jurisdictions. In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual
taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.  

Cash
Flows Reporting    

The
Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash
receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions
of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (the  Indirect Method ) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile
it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and
payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income
that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments  

Subsequent
Events    

The
Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent
events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU
2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as a filer with the United States Securities   Exchange
Commission (the  SEC ) considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as
through filing them on EDGAR.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

In
August 2014, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15   Presentation of Financial Statements Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU
2014-15 ).   

In
connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity s management should
evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the  financial statements are issued  (or within
one year after the date that the  financial statements are available to be issued  when applicable). Management s evaluation
should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the  financial statements
are issued  (or at the date that the  financial statements are available to be issued  when applicable). Substantial doubt
about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate,
indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the
date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The term  probable  is used consistently with
its use in Topic 450,  Contingencies .    

When
management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going
concern, management should consider whether its plans that are intended to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate
the substantial doubt. The mitigating effect of management s plans should be considered only to the extent that (1) it is
probable that the plans will be effectively implemented and, if so, (2) it is probable that the plans will mitigate the conditions
or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  

If
conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial
doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, the entity should disclose information that enables
users of the financial statements to understand all of the following (or refer to similar information disclosed elsewhere in the
footnotes):  

a.  
      Principal
    conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern (before
    consideration of management s plans)   

b.  
      Management s
    evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity s ability to meet its obligations   

c.  
      Management s
    plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.   

If
conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and substantial doubt
is not alleviated after consideration of management s plans, an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating
that there is  substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern  within one year after the
date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). Additionally, the entity should disclose information
that enables users of the financial statements to understand all of the following:  

a.  
      Principal
    conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern   

b.  
      Management s
    evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity s ability to meet its obligations   

c.  
      Management s
    plans that are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability
    to continue as a going concern.   

The
amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim
periods thereafter. Early application is permitted.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes   ( ASU 2015-17 ). This update simplifies the presentation of deferred income
taxes; the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial
position.  

For
public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01   Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic
825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ).  

This
Update makes limited amendments to the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. The
new standard significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments
in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.
It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. Some of the major changes
as a result of the ASU 2016-01 are summarized below.  

Requires
    equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation
    of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.   

Simplify
    the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment
    to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the
    investment at fair value.   

Eliminate
    the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair
    value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet.   

Require
    public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure
    purposes.   

Require
    an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability
    resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair
    value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments.   

Require
    separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that
    is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.   

Clarify
    that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities
    in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.   

For
public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within those fiscal years.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which will amend current lease accounting to require
lessees to recognize (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease,
measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use,
or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements
applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting
model. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. The Company is currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results
of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation   which simplifies several aspects
of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting
for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash
flows. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption will be permitted in any interim or annual period for which
financial statements have not yet been issued or have not been made available for issuance. If early adoption is elected, all
amendments in the ASU that apply must be adopted in the same period. In addition, if early adoption is elected in an interim period,
any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. The Company is
in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 10   Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing .  The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic
606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations
and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation
guidance on (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether
an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property
(which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over
time). The amendments in this Update are intended render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce
the degree of judgment necessary to comply with Topic 606. The Company is currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine
if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply,
in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently
in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material
effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  

Note
3   Going Concern   

The
Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial
Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ) .  

The
Company's condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  

As
reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016, a
net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company is attempting to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues; however, its cash position may
not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to further implement
its business plan and generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private
offering, there can be no assurance to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues and its ability to raise additional funds
by way of a public or private offering.  

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.    

Note
4   Property and Equipment   

Property
and equipment stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, consisted of the following:  

Depreciation
expense was $10,933 and $5,508 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Depreciation expense was
$31,717 and $8,312 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Note 5   Line of Credit  

On March 19, 2009 Astoria Surgical
Supplies North LLC ( Astoria ), a now defunct subsidiary of the Company, signed a revolving note (the  Note )
at PNC Bank (the  Bank ). The outstanding balance of this Note is limited to $200,000 and expired March 19, 2010. The
outstanding balance accrues interest at a variable rate. The interest rate is subject to change based on changes in an independent
index which is the highest Prime Rate as published in the  Money Rates  section of the Wall Street Journal. Interest
is payable monthly and the rate as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 3.50% and 4.25%, respectively. 

The Note is personally guaranteed
by two third parties (the  Guarantors ). In January 2016, the Company assigned all business operations of Astoria and
agreed to indemnify the Guarantors for any amounts due or actions arising pursuant to the Loan. The Company has been in payment
default since March 19, 2010 but has negotiated a a monthly installment payment plan with the Bank. The Company does not believe
it is probable that amounts due under the Note will be called or that the interest rate will be increased to the default interest
rate due to the fact that the Company is current and has been current since the maturity date with its monthly installment payment
obligations. 

 The balance outstanding on the
Note at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $203,988 and $202,422, respectively. 

Note 6   Convertible Note Payable  

On December 2, 2015, the Company issued
a convertible note to a third party lender totaling $100,000. The note accrues interest at 12% per annum and matures with interest
and principal both due on December 1, 2016. In addition the Company issued a warrant to purchase 300,000 shares of Company common
stock. The note and accrued interest are convertible at a conversion price of $0.35 per share subject to adjustment. The warrant
issued in connection therewith entitles the holder to purchase the Company s common stock at a purchase price of $0.35 per
share for a period of five years from the issue date. 

On December 21, 2015, the notes were
automatically converted into Series B preferred stock. 

On March 17, 2016, the Company issued
a convertible note to a third party lender totaling $200,000. The note accrues interest at 12% per annum and matures with interest
and principal both due on April 21, 2016. In addition the Company issued a warrant to purchase 150,000 shares of Company common
stock. The note and accrued interest are convertible at a conversion price as defined therein. The warrant issued in connection
therewith entitles the holder to purchase the Company s common stock at a purchase price of $0.40 per share for a period
of five years from the issue date. 

On May 27, 2016, the note and accrued
interest were paid off in full satisfaction. 

On August 2, 2016, the Company issued
a convertible note to a third party lender totaling $50,000. The note accrues interest equal to 10% of the principal balance and
matures with interest and principal both due on August 31, 2016. The note and accrued interest are convertible at a conversion
price as defined therein. On August 22, 2016, the note and accrued interest were paid off in full satisfaction. 

Note 7   Related Party Loan  

On May 26, 2016, the Company entered
into a loan agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with Arthur Rosen, an individual (the  Lender ), pursuant

Preferred
Stock    

Series
A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock    

On
February 13, 2015, 100,000 shares of preferred stock were designated as Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series
A ). Each share of Series A shall have a stated value equal to $100.00 (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations
or splits with respect to such shares) (the  Series A Stated Value ).  

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold 24,400 shares of Series A for proceeds of $2,450,000. In addition, $800,000
in convertible notes and $91,400 in accrued interest were converted into 8,914 shares of the Company s Series A.  

The
holders of the Series A shall be entitled to receive preferential dividends at the rate of 6% per share per annum on the Series
A Stated Value, but before any dividend or other distribution will be paid or declared and set apart for payment on any shares
of any Junior Stock, as defined. Such dividends shall compound annually and be fully cumulative, and shall accumulate from the
date of original issuance of the Series A and shall be payable quarterly, in arrears, commencing on the first day of the calendar
quarter following the date on which the Series A is issued. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined below) and
while such Event of Default is outstanding, such dividend rate shall be increased to 15% per annum on the Series A Stated Value.
At the Company's option, such dividend payments may be made in (i) cash (ii) additional shares of Series A valued at the Series
A Stated Value thereof, in an amount equal to 150% of the cash dividend otherwise payable or (iii) a combination of cash and additional
shares of Series A, provided there is not an existing current Event of Default on the date on which a dividend payment is payable,
in which event the Holder entitled to receive such dividend may elect to receive such dividends in cash or additional shares of
Series A Preferred.  

The
dividends on the Series A shall be cumulative whether or not declared so that, if at any time full cumulative dividends at the
rate aforesaid on all shares of the Series A then outstanding from the date from and after which dividends thereon are cumulative
to the end of the annual dividend period next preceding such time shall not have been paid or declared and set apart for payment,
or if the full dividend on all such outstanding Series A for the then current dividend period shall not have been paid or declared
and set apart for payment, the amount of the deficiency shall be paid or declared and set apart for payment before any sum shall
be set apart for or applied by the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation to the purchase, redemption or other acquisition
of the Series A or any shares of any other class of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A and before any dividend or other
distribution shall be paid or declared and set apart for payment on any Junior Stock and before any sum shall be set aside for
or applied to the purchase, redemption or other acquisition of any Junior Stock.  

Holder
of Series A shall have the right at any time after the issuance, to convert such shares, accrued but unpaid declared dividends
on the Series A and any other sum owed by the Corporation arising from the Series A into fully paid and non-assessable shares
of Common Stock (the  Conversion Shares ) of the Corporation determined in accordance with the applicable conversion
price (the  Conversion Price ).  

The
number of Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion shall equal (i) the sum of (A) the Series A Stated Value being converted
and/or (B) at the Holder's election, accrued and unpaid dividends or any other component of the Conversion Amount, divided by
(ii) the Conversion Price. The Conversion Price of the Series A shall be $0.25, subject to adjustment.    

The
Corporation and the Holder may not convert that amount of the Conversion Amount on a Conversion Date in amounts that would result
in the Holder having a beneficial ownership of Common Stock which would be in excess of the sum of (i) the number of shares of
Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates on such Conversion Date, and (ii) the number of Conversion Shares
issuable upon the conversion of the Conversion Amount with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made on
such Conversion Date, which would result in the aggregate beneficial ownership by the Holder and its Affiliates of more than 4.99%
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation. For the purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence,
beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and Regulation 13d-3 thereunder. Subject
to the foregoing, the Holder shall not be limited to successive exercises which would result in the aggregate issuance of more
than 4.99%. The Holder may allocate which of the equity of the Corporation deemed beneficially owned by the Holder shall be included
in the 4.99% amount described above and which shall be allocated to the excess above 4.99%. The Holder may waive the conversion
limitation described in this Section in whole or in part, upon and effective after sixty one (61) days' prior written notice to
the Corporation.  

The
holders of our Series A do vote together with the holders of our Common Stock on an as converted basis on each matter submitted
to a vote of holders of Common Stock. The number of votes that may be cast by a holder of Series A shall be equal to the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Holder's Series A on the record date for determining those stockholders
entitled to vote on the matter. In addition, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding Series A is
required to for the following actions:  

(a)
amending the Corporation's certificate of incorporation or by-laws if such amendment would adversely affect the Series A  

(b)
purchasing any of the Corporation's securities other than required redemptions of Series A and repurchase under restricted stock
and option agreements authorizing the Corporation's employees;  

(c)
effecting a Liquidation Event;  

(d)
declaring or paying any dividends other than in respect of the Series A; and  

(e)
issuing any additional securities having rights senior to or on parity with the Series A.  

On
August 31, 2016, a holder of Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series A ) converted 1,099 shares of
Series A into 1,098,933 common shares of the Company s common stock.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company accrued $3,318,353 for liquidating damages on the Series A and $309,665
on the warrants associated with the Series A.  

Series
B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock    

On
December 21, 2015, 20,000 shares of preferred stock were designated as Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series
B ). Each share of Series B shall have a stated value equal to $100.00 (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations
or splits with respect to such shares) (the  Series B Stated Value ).  

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold 7,000 shares of Series B for proceeds of $700,000.  

The
holders of outstanding shares of Series B shall be entitled to receive preferential dividends at the rate of 6% per share per
annum on the Series B Stated Value, but before any dividend or other distribution will be paid or declared and set apart for payment
on any shares of any Junior Stock as defined. Such dividends shall compound annually and be fully cumulative, and shall accumulate
from the date of original issuance of the Series B, and shall be payable quarterly, in arrears, commencing on the first day of
the calendar quarter following the date on which the Series B is issued. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined
below and while such Event of Default is outstanding, such dividend rate shall be increased to 15% per annum on the Series B Stated
Value. At the Corporation's option, such dividend payments may be made in (i) cash (ii) additional shares of Series B valued at
the Series B Stated Value thereof, in an amount equal to 100% of the cash dividend otherwise payable or (iii) a combination of
cash and additional shares of Series B, provided there is not an existing current Event of Default on the date on which a dividend
payment is payable, in which event the Holder entitled to receive such dividend may elect to receive such dividends in cash or
additional shares of Series B Preferred.  

The
dividends on the Series B shall be cumulative whether or not declared so that, if at any time full cumulative dividends at the
rate aforesaid on all shares of the Series B then outstanding from the date from and after which dividends thereon are cumulative
to the end of the annual dividend period next preceding such time shall not have been paid or declared and set apart for payment,
or if the full dividend on all such outstanding Series B for the then current dividend period shall not have been paid or declared
and set apart for payment, the amount of the deficiency shall be paid or declared and set apart for payment before any sum shall
be set apart for or applied by the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation to the purchase, redemption or other acquisition
of the Series B or any shares of any other class of stock ranking on a parity with the Series B and before any dividend or other
distribution shall be paid or declared and set apart for payment on any Junior Stock and before any sum shall be set aside for
or applied to the purchase, redemption or other acquisition of any Junior Stock.    

Holders
of shares of Series B shall have the right at any time commencing after the issuance to convert such shares, accrued but unpaid
declared dividends on the Series B into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (the  Conversion Shares )
of the Corporation determined in accordance with the applicable conversion price (the  Conversion Price ). All declared
or accrued but unpaid dividends may be converted at the election of the Holder together with or independent of the conversion
of the Series B Stated Value of the Series B.  

The
number of Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion of the Conversion Amount shall equal (i) the sum of (A) the Series B Stated
Value being converted and/or (B) at the Holder's election, accrued and unpaid dividends or any other component of the Conversion
Amount, divided by (ii) the Conversion Price. The Conversion Price of the Series B shall be $0.30, subject to adjustment.  

The
Corporation and the Holder may not convert that amount of the Conversion Amount on a Conversion Date in amounts that would result
in the Holder having a beneficial ownership of Common Stock which would be in excess of the sum of (i) the number of shares of
Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates on such Conversion Date, and (ii) the number of Conversion Shares
issuable upon the conversion of the Conversion Amount with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made on
such Conversion Date, which would result in the aggregate beneficial ownership by the Holder and its Affiliates of more than 4.99%
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation. For the purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence,
beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and Regulation 13d-3 thereunder. Subject
to the foregoing, the Holder shall not be limited to successive exercises which would result in the aggregate issuance of more
than 4.99%. The Holder may allocate which of the equity of the Corporation deemed beneficially owned by the Holder shall be included
in the 4.99% amount described above and which shall be allocated to the excess above 4.99%. The Holder may waive the conversion
limitation described in this Section in whole or in part, upon and effective after sixty one (61) days' prior written notice to
the Corporation.  

The
holders of our Series B do vote together with the holders of our Common Stock on an as converted basis on each matter submitted
to a vote of holders of Common Stock. The number of votes that may be cast by a holder of Series B shall be equal to the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Holder's Series B on the record date for determining those stockholders
entitled to vote on the matter. In addition, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding Series B is
required to for the following actions:  

(a)
amending the Corporation's certificate of incorporation or by-laws if such amendment would adversely affect the Series B  

(b)
purchasing any of the Corporation's securities other than required redemptions of Series B and repurchase under restricted stock
and option agreements authorizing the Corporation's employees;  

(c)
effecting a Liquidation Event;  

(d)
declaring or paying any dividends other than in respect of the Company's Series A or Series B; and  

(e)
issuing any additional securities having rights senior to the Series B.

the warrants associated with the Series B.

The
purpose of the Plan is to provide additional incentive to those officers, employees, consultants and non-employee directors of
the Company and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates whose contributions are essential to the growth and success of the Company s

authority to grant to any eligible recipient any options, restricted stock or other awards valued in whole or in part by reference
to, or otherwise based on, our Common Stock.  

The
provisions of each option granted need not be the same with respect to each option recipient. Option recipients shall enter into
award agreements with us, in such form as the board shall determine.  

The
Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee consisting of two or more independent, non-employee and outside directors.
In the absence of such a Committee, the Board of the Company shall administer the Plan.  

Each

    purchase price of each share of Common Stock with respect to Incentive Options shall be determined by the Committee at the
    time of grant, shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value (defined as the closing price on the final trading day
    immediately prior to the grant on the principal exchange or quotation system on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted,
    as applicable) of the Common Stock of the Jerrick,  provided  that if the recipient of the Option owns more than ten
    percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of the Jerrick, the exercise price shall be at least 110% of the Fair Market
    Value;   

(ii)  
      The
    purchase price of each share of Common Stock purchasable under a Non-qualified Option shall be at least 100% of the Fair Market
    Value of such share of Common Stock on the date the Non-qualified Option is granted,  unless  the Committee, in its sole
    and absolute discretion, determines to set the purchase price of such Non-qualified Option below Fair Market Value.   

(iii)  
      the
    term of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee,  provided  that such Option shall not be exercisable more than five
    (5) years after the date such Option is granted, and  provided further  that with respect to an Incentive Option, if
    the recipient owns more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of the Jerrick, the Incentive Option shall
    not be exercisable more than five (5) years after the date such Incentive Option is granted;   

(iv)  
      subject
    to acceleration in the event of a Change of Control of the Jerrick (as further described in the Plan), the period during which
    the Options vest shall be designated by the Committee or, in the absence of any Option vesting periods designated by the Committee
    at the time of grant, shall vest and become exercisable in equal amounts on each fiscal quarter of the Jerrick through the
    four (4) year anniversary of the date on which the Option was granted;   

(vi)  
      no
    Option is transferable and each is exercisable only by the recipient of such Option except in the event of the death of the
    recipient; and   

(vii)  
      with
    respect to Incentive Options, the aggregate Fair Market Value of Common Stock exercisable for the first time during any calendar
    year shall not exceed $100,000.   

Each
award of Restricted Stock is subject to the following material terms:  

(i)  
      no
    rights to an award of Restricted Stock are granted to the intended recipient of Restricted Stock unless and until the grant
    of Restricted Stock is accepted within the period prescribed by the Compensation Committee;   

(ii)  
      Restricted
    Stock shall not be delivered until they are free of any restrictions specified by the Compensation Committee at the time of
    grant;   

(iii)  
      recipients
    of Restricted Stock have the rights of a stockholder of the Jerrick as of the date of the grant of the Restricted Stock;   

(iv)  
      shares
    of Restricted Stock are forfeitable until the terms of the Restricted Stock grant have been satisfied or the employment with
    the Company is terminated; and   

(v)  
      the
    Restricted Stock is not transferable until the date on which the Compensation Committee has specified such restrictions have
    lapsed.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other reports filed by Jerrick Media Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ) from time to
time with the SEC (collectively, the  Filings ) contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information
that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company s management as well as estimates and
assumptions made by Company s management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the Filings, the words  anticipate, 
 believe,   estimate,   expect,   future,   intend,   plan, 
or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company s management identify
forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject
to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including the risks relating to the Company s business, industry,
and the Company s operations and results of operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize,
or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed,
estimated, expected, intended, or planned.  

Although
the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee
future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities
laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results.  

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments
and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments
and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results.
In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s
judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative
would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  

Overview   

We
intend for this discussion to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain
key items in those financial statements, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting
principles affect our financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying
notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, included elsewhere in this report.  

We
produce and distribute digital media content, including, but not limited to, videos, imagery, articles, e-books, film, and television,
across multiple platforms for each brand in our portfolio. We sell genre specific products related to our brands, including but
limited to, video downloads, image downloads, photographs, art, magazines, apparel, toys, and signed and unsigned collectibles
to consumers through our online stores, auctions, conventions, and third party wholesalers and retailers. Revenues are generated
in two different categories: (i) the sale of advertising and marketing services related to our content, including but not limited
to pre-roll videos, text and image advertisements, native advertisements, and affiliate marketing and (ii) the sale of genre specific
products related to our brands and, licensing of our content for download-to-own services. Demand and pricing for our advertising
depends on our user base and overall market conditions. We also drive additional demand through integrated sales of digital advertising
inventory and through our marketing services, providing unique branded entertainment and custom sponsorship opportunities to our
advertisers. Our advertising revenues may be affected by the strength of advertising markets and general economic conditions and
may fluctuate depending on the success of our content, as measured by the number of people visiting our websites at any given
time.

Critical
Accounting Policies   

We
believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.    

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s). Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, varying from 3 to 5 years or, when applicable, the life
of the lease, whichever is shorter.  

Carrying
Value, Recoverability and Impairment of long-lived assets   

The
Company has adopted paragraph 360-10-35-17 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) Accounting
Standards Codification (  ASC  ) for its long-lived assets. The Company s long-lived assets, which include
property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable.  

The
Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated
with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective
carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair
value is generally determined using the asset s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.
If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than
originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated
useful lives.  

The
Company considers the following to be some examples of important indicators that may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant
under-performance or losses of assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant
changes in the manner or use of assets or in the Company s overall strategy with respect to the manner or use of the acquired
assets or changes in the Company s overall business strategy; (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iv)
increased competitive pressures; and (v) regulatory changes. The Company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators
at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events.  

The
impairment charges, if any, are included in operating expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB ASC. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined
based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted
tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.  

The
Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB ASC ( Section 740-10-25 ). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination
of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under
Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not
that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that
has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides
guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires
increased disclosures.  

The
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carryforwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability
of deferred tax assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.  

Management
makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous
estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in
these jurisdictions. In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual
taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company follows Paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB ASC for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is
realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria
are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered
to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  

Equity based
compensation   

The
Company recognizes compensation expense for all equity based payments in accordance with ASC 718   Compensation
  Stock Compensation  . Under fair value recognition provisions, the Company recognizes equity based compensation
net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest over the requisite
service period of the award.  

Restricted
stock awards are granted at the discretion of the Company. These awards are restricted as to the transfer of ownership and generally
vest over the requisite service periods, typically over a four year period (vesting on a straight line basis). The fair
value of a stock award is equal to the fair market value of a share of Company stock on the grant date.  

The
fair value of option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option valuation model. The Black Scholes
option valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are input into the model. These assumptions are the expected
stock volatility, the risk free interest rate, the expected life of the option, the dividend yield on the underlying stock
and the expected forfeiture rate. Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Company s
Common stock over the expected option life and other appropriate factors. Risk free interest rates are calculated based
on continuously compounded risk free rates for the appropriate term. The dividend yield is assumed to be zero as the Company
has never paid or declared any cash dividends on our Common stock and does not intend to pay dividends on our Common stock in
the foreseeable future. The expected forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical experience.  

Determining
the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards requires the input of the
subjective assumptions described above. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards
represent management s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment.
As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, our equity based compensation could be materially
different in the future. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only
for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the equity based
compensation could be significantly different from what the Company has recorded in the current period.  

The
Company accounts for share based payments granted to non employees in accordance with ASC 505-40,   Equity
Based Payments to Non Employees  . The Company determines the fair value of the stock based payment as either
the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions
as of the earlier of either (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments
is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete. The fair value of the equity instruments
is re-measured each reporting period over the requisite service period.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

We
follow Paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB ASC for disclosures about fair value of our financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37
of the FASB ASC ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to measure the fair value of our financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency
and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described
below:  

Level
    1   Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date;   

Level
    2   Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly
    observable as of the reporting date; and   

Level
    3   Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.  

The
carrying amount of the Company s assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and unearned revenue approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those
instruments.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
November 2015, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes   ( ASU 2015-17 ). This update simplifies the presentation of deferred income
taxes; the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial
position.  

For
public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01   Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic
825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ).  

This
Update makes limited amendments to the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. The
new standard significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments
in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.
It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. Some of the major changes
as a result of the ASU 2016-01 are summarized below.  

Requires
    equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation
    of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.   

Simplify
    the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment
    to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the
    investment at fair value.   

Eliminate
    the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair
    value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet.   

Require
    public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure
    purposes.   

Require
    an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability
    resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair
    value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments.   

Require
    separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that
    is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.   

Clarify
    that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities
    in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.   

For
public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within those fiscal years.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which will amend current lease accounting to require
lessees to recognize (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease,
measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use,
or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements
applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting
model. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. The Company is currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results
of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation   which simplifies several aspects
of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting
for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash
flows. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption will be permitted in any interim or annual period for which
financial statements have not yet been issued or have not been made available for issuance. If early adoption is elected, all
amendments in the ASU that apply must be adopted in the same period. In addition, if early adoption is elected in an interim period,
any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. The Company is
in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016 10   Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing .  The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic
606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations
and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation
guidance on (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether
an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property
(which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over
time). The amendments in this Update are intended render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce
the degree of judgement necessary to comply with Topic 606. The Company is currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine
if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply,
in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently
in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material
effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s
management, including the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based
upon that evaluation, management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. The Company is committed to improving financial organization. As part of this commitment,
management and the Board will perform an extensive review of the Company s policies and procedures as it relates to financial
reporting in an effort to mitigate future risks of potential misstatements. The Company will focus on continuing to develop and
documenting internal controls and procedures surrounding the financial reporting process, primarily through the use of account
reconciliations, and supervision
