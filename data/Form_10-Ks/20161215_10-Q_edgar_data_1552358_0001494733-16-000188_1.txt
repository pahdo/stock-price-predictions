NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     October 31, 2016     NOTE 1         CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    The    Company    was    incorporated    in    the    State    of    Nevada    as    a    for-profit    Company    on    April    17,    2012    and   established a fiscal year end of April 30.   In  the  opinion  of  management,  the  accompanying  balance  sheets  and  related  interim  statements  of   income,    cash flows, and stockholders       equity include all    adjustments,    consisting only of normal    recurring   items, necessary for their fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in   the    United    States    of    America    (   US    GAAP   ).      Preparing    financial    statements    requires    management    to   make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenue,  and   expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management   s estimates and assumptions.   Interim    results    are    not    necessarily    indicative    of    results    for    a    full    year.     The    information    included    in    this   Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Form 10-K.    NOTE 2         GOING CONCERN    The  Company   s  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting   principles applicable to a going concern.  This contemplates the realization of assets    and the liquidation of   liabilities    in    the    normal    course    of    business.    Currently,    the    Company    has    a    working    capital    deficit    of   $107,273, an accumulated deficit of $134,688. The Company does not have a source of revenue sufficient   to    cover    its    operation    costs    giving    substantial    doubt    for    it    to    continue    as    a    going    concern.    The    Company   will    be    dependent    upon    the raising of    additional    capital    through    placement    of    our common    stock in    order   to    implement    its    business    plan,    or    merge    with    an    operating company.     There    can be    no    assurance    that    the   Company    will    be    successful    in    either    situation    in    order    to    continue    as    a    going    concern.     The    Company    is   funding its initial operations by way of issuing Founder   s shares.   The     officers     and     directors     have     committed     to     advancing     certain     operating     costs     of     the     Company,   including Legal, Audit, Transfer Agency and Edgarizing costs    NOTE 3 - CAPITAL STOCK    The    Company   s    capitalization    is    75,000,000    common    shares    with    a    par    value    of    $0.001    per    share.   No   preferred shares have been authorized or issued.   On    April    25,    2012,    the    Company    issued    7,500,000    Founder's    shares    for    cash    at    $0.001    per    share.    In   September 2012 the Company issued 260,000 common shares for cash at $0.02 per share.   On December 13, 2014 7,000,000 common shares were retired.   On    October    31,    2016    and    on    April    30,    2015,    the    Company    had    760,000    common    shares    issued    and   outstanding.   As    of    October    31,    2016,    the    Company    has    not    granted    any    stock    options    and    has    not    recorded    any    stock-   based compensation.    NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS           As of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2015, the Company has received $93,947 and $82,318 respectively,   in    loans    and    payment    of    expenses    from    a    related    party.    The    loans    are    payable    on    demand    and    without   interest.    NOTE 5 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    The company has evaluated all the recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will   have a material effect on the company   s financial statement.    NOTE 6 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS    The    Company has    evaluated    subsequent    events from the    balance sheet    date    through    the    date the    financial   statements were issued and has determined that there are no further events to disclose.                                                        ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT`S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    This    section    of    this    report    includes    a    number    of    forward-looking    statements    that    reflect   our    current    views    with    respect    to    future    events    and    financial    performance.   Forward    looking   statements  are  often  identified  by  words  like:  believe,  expect,  estimate,  anticipate,  intend,   project    and    similar    expressions    or    words    which,    by    their    nature,    refer    to    future    events.   You   should    not    place    undue    certainty    on    these    forward-looking    statements,    which    apply    only    as    of   the  date  of  this  report.   These  forward  looking  statements  are  subject  to  certain  risks  and   uncertainties    that    could    cause    actual    results    to    differ    materially    from    historical    results    or    our   predictions.    Summary Information    On    April    17,    2012,    Mr.    Vagner    Gomes    Tome,    our    former    executive    officer    and    former   director,    incorporated    the    Company    in    the    State    of    Nevada    and    established    a    fiscal    year    end    of   April 30th.    On May 23,    2013 the Company accepted the resignation of    Vagner    Gomes Tome as   the    sole    director    and    officer    of    the    Company    and    accepted    the    appointment    of    Joelyn    Alcantara   to    serve    in    his    stead.    The    objective    of  the    company    remains    to    introduce    advertisement  in   nightclub line-ups.   We    are    a    company    that    intends    to    provide    TV    streaming    advertisements    for    customers   lining up on the outside of the nightclubs. The idea is to showcase pictures of that particular club   scene,    special    events,    deals    on    drink    specials    and    advertisements    from    local    businesses    and   other    companies.    We    plan    on    providing    the    TV    at    no    cost    to    the    club    and    to    generate    revenue   through     the     sale     of     advertisements     from     local     restaurants,     cigarette     companies,     alcohol   companies, clothing companies, ads for sports and entertainment events, etc.   On     December     13,     2013,     Mr.     Vagner     Gomes     Tome,     surrendered     for     cancellation   7,000,000    shares    of    common    stock    of    the    Company.   On    March    10,    2014,    Ms.    Alcantara,    our   current    sole    executive    officer    and    director,    acquired    the    remaining    500,000    shares    of    common   stock of the Company formerly owned by Mr. Tome for a purchase price of $0.05    per share. Ms.   Alcantara    is    currently    the    holder    of    65.7%    of    the    issued    and    outstanding    shares    of    common   stock of the Company and is the majority shareholder of the Company   As    of    the    date    of    this    quarterly    report,    we    have    not    yet    contacted    any    potential    clients.   Furthermore,    we    have    not    yet    developed    our    systems    and    services.    The    Company    has    not    yet   implemented its business model and to date has generated no revenues.   We    have    been    unable    to    raise    additional    funds    to    implement    our    operations,    and    we    do   not    believe    that    we    currently    have    sufficient    resources    to    do    so    without    additional    funding.    As    a   result,  our  Board  of  Directors  has  begun  to  analyze  strategic  alternatives  available  to  our   Company    to    continue    as    a    going    concern.    Such    alternatives    include    raising    additional    debt    or   equity    financing    or    consummating    a    merger    or    acquisition    with    a    partner    that    may    involve    a   change in our business plan.   Although    our    Board    of    Directors'    preference    would    be    to    obtain    additional    funding    to   implement  our  business  plan,  the  Board  believes  that  it  must  consider  all  viable  strategic   alternatives that are in the best interests of our shareholders. Such strategic    alternatives include   a  merger,  acquisition,  share  exchange,  asset  purchase,  or  similar  transaction  in  which  our   present    management    will    no    longer    be    in    control    of    our    Company    and    our    business    operations   will  be  replaced  by  that  of  our  transaction  partner.  We  believe  we  would  be  an  attractive          candidate    for    such    a    business    combination    due    to    the    perceived    benefits    of    being    a    publicly   registered company, thereby providing a transaction partner access to the public marketplace to   raise capital.   We     have     had     preliminary     discussions     with     other     potential     business     combination   partners,    but    have    not    signed    a    definitive    agreement    to    engage    in    a    strategic    transaction.    Any   such    business    combination    and    the    selection    of    a    partner    for    such    a    business    combination   involves    certain    risks,    including    analyzing    and    selecting    a business    partner    that    is    compatible to   engage in a transaction with us or has business operations that are or will prove to be profitable.   In    the    event    we    select    a    partner    for    a    strategic    transaction    and    sign    a    definitive    agreement    to   consummate    such    a    transaction,    we    will    report    this    event    on    a    Form    8-K    to    be    filed    with    the   Securities     and     Exchange     Commission.     If     we     are     unable     to     locate     a     suitable     business   combination partner and are otherwise unable to raise additional funding, we will likely be forced   to cease business operations.    Results of Operations    Revenue   We did not generate any revenue during the three month periods ending October 31,   2016 and 2015.   Expenses   We    incurred    expenses    in    the    amount    of    $14,598    during    the    six    month    period    ending   October  31,  2016    and    $17,920    during    the    six    month    period    ending  October    31,    2015.    The   decrease  in  expenses  have  been  to  decreased  costs  related  to  legal  and  accounting  cost   associated with filing quarterly and annual reports.   Net Loss   We incurred a net loss of $14,598 and $17,902 during the six month periods ending   October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    As    of    October    31,    2016,    we    had    $0    in    cash,    with    liabilities    of    $107,273,    as compared to   $0    in    cash    and    $92,676    in    liabilities    at    April    30,    2016.    Our    current    cash    holdings    will    not    satisfy   our     liquidity     requirements     and     we     will     require     additional     financing     to     pursue     our     planned   business activities.   Net cash used in operating activities for the three month periods ending October 31,   2016 and 2015 was $0 and $0, respectively. We had $0 net cash provided by financing   activities for the six month periods ending October 31, 2016 and 2015.   As    of    October    31,    2016    and    April    30,    2016,    the    Company    has    received    $93,947    and   $82,318,    respectively,    in    loans    and    payment    of    expenses    from    a    related    party.    The    loans    are   payable    on    demand    and    without    interest.    The    funds    provided    to    the    Company    by    the    former   President and current President have no interest and no fixed repayment date.   Our    officer    and    director    has    committed    to    advancing    funds    (up    to    $25,000)    for    the    next          twelve    months    to    cover    expenses    to    maintain    the    reporting    status    current    with    the    SEC.    Ms.   Joelyn  Alcantara  is  willing  to  lend  the  full  amount  of  these  funds  to  the  Company  as  the   expenses    are    incurred,    if    necessary    or    if    no    other    proceeds    are    obtained    by    the    Company.   However,    there    is    no    contract    in    place    or    written    agreement    with    Ms.    Alcantara    and    the    funds   expressed    in    the    above    president   s    verbal    commitment,    would    be    in    the    form    of    a    non-secured   loan and would have no interest and no fixed repayment date.   Additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and   thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. The failure to secure additional equity   financing would result in need to seek capital from other resources such as debt financing,   which may not be available to the Company. However, if such financing were available,   because we are a company with no operations to date, it would likely have to pay additional   costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such   time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing. If   the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or   secure debt financing, it would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors   may lose all of their investment.    Off-balance sheet arrangements    The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have   a     current     or     future     effect     or     change     on     the     Company   s     financial     condition,     revenues     or   expenses,  results  of  operations,  liquidity,  capital  expenditures  or  capital  resources  that  are   material   to   investors.   The   term      off-balance   sheet   arrangement      generally   means   any   transaction,    agreement    or    other    contractual    arrangement    to    which    an    entity unconsolidated    with   the  Company  is  a  party,  under  which  the  Company  has  (i)  any  obligation  arising  under  a   guarantee    contract,    derivative    instrument    or    variable    interest;    or    (ii)    a    retained    or    contingent   interest in assets transferred to such entity or    similar    arrangement that serves as credit,    liquidity   or market risk support for such assets.    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    Not required.    Item 4. Controls and Procedures     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our   management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who is our Principal Executive Officer) and   our Chief Financial Officer (who is our Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting   Officer), of the effectiveness of the design of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined   by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of October 31, 2016, pursuant to Exchange   Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal   Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of   October 31, 2016 in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we   file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within   the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission   s (the    SEC   ) rules and   forms. This conclusion is based on findings that constituted material weaknesses. A material   weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over   financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the   Company   s interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.          In performing the above-referenced assessment, our management identified the   following material weaknesses:    1   .             Lack   of   formal   policies   and   procedures   necessary   to   adequately   review       significant         accounting         transactions.                     The     Company     utilizes     a     third     party     independent   contractor    for    the    preparation    of    its    financial    statements.    Although    the    financial    statements    and   footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant   accounting  transactions    and  the  accounting  treatment  of  such  transactions.  The  third  party   independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the Company and may not   be   provided   information   from   management   on   a   timely   basis   to   allow   for   adequate   reporting/consideration of certain transactions.    2   .              Audit        Committee        and        Financial        Expert  .    The    Company    does    not    have    a    formal    audit   committee    with    a    financial    expert,    and    thus    the    Company    lacks    the    board    oversight    role    within   the financial reporting process.   Our  management  feels  the  weaknesses  identified  above  have  not  had  any    material   affect    on    our    financial    results.    However,    we    are    currently    reviewing    our    disclosure    controls    and   procedures related    to these    material    weaknesses    and    expect    to    implement    changes    in    the    near   term,     including     identifying     specific     areas     within     our     governance,     accounting     and     financial   reporting   processes   to   add   adequate   resources   to   potentially   mitigate   these   material   weaknesses.   Our    management    team    will    continue    to    monitor    and    evaluate    the    effectiveness    of    our   internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing   basis    and    is    committed    to    taking    further    action    and    implementing    additional    enhancements    or   improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.   Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not   prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of    any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods   are    subject    to    the    risk    that    controls    may    become    inadequate    because    of    changes    in    conditions,   or    that    the    degree    of    compliance    with    the    policies    or    procedures    may    deteriorate.    All    internal   control    systems,    no    matter    how    well    designed,    have    inherent    limitations.    Therefore,    even    those   systems  determined    to    be    effective    can    provide    only    reasonable    assurance    with    respect  to   financial statement preparation and presentation.    Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting    There    were    no    changes    in    our    internal    controls    over    financial    reporting    that    occurred   during  the  quarterly  period  ended  October  31,  2016  that  have  materially  affected,  or  are   reasonably    likely    to    materially    affect,    our    internal    controls    over    financial    reporting.    We    believe   that    a    control    system,    no    matter    how    well    designed    and    operated,    cannot    provide    absolute   assurance    that    the    objectives    of    the    control    system    are    met,    and    no    evaluation    of    controls    can   provide    absolute    assurance    that    all    control    issues    and    instances    of    fraud,    if    any,    within    any   company have been detected.
