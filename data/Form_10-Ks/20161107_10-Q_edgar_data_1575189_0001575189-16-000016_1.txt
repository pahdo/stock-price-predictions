NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Match Group, Inc. is the world's leading provider of dating products.  We operate a portfolio of over   45   brands, including Match, OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, Tinder, Meetic, Twoo, OurTime, BlackPeopleMeet and LoveScout24 (formerly known as FriendScout24), each designed to increase our users' likelihood of finding a romantic connection.  Through our portfolio of trusted brands, we provide tailored products to meet the varying preferences of our users.  We currently offer our dating products in   38   languages across more than   190   countries.  Match Group has   two   operating segments: Dating and Non-dating. 
  Through the brands within our Dating business, we are a leading provider of membership-based and ad-supported dating products servicing North America, Western Europe and many other countries around the world.  We provide these services through websites and applications that we own and operate.  The Non-dating business consists of The Princeton Review, which provides a variety of educational test preparation, academic tutoring and college counseling services. 
  On November 24, 2015, the Company completed its initial public offering ("IPO") of   38.3 million   shares of its common stock at a price of   $12.00   per share for net proceeds of   $428.3 million  .  At   September 30, 2016  , IAC/InterActiveCorp's ("IAC") ownership interest and voting interest in Match Group were   82.8%   and   98.0%  , respectively. 
  All references to "Match Group," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us" in this report are to Match Group, Inc. 
  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  
  The Company prepares its consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  The Company's financial statements were prepared on a consolidated basis beginning October 1, 2015 and on a combined basis for periods prior thereto.  The difference in presentation is due to the fact that the final steps of the legal reorganization of the entities included in Match Group at the time of the IPO were not completed until October 1, 2015.  The preparation of financial statements on a combined basis for periods prior thereto allows for the financial statements to be presented on a consistent basis for all periods presented.  The combined financial statements reflect the results of operations and cash flows of Match Group's businesses since their respective dates of acquisition by IAC.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, all entities that are wholly-owned by the Company and all entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. 
  The combined financial statements reflect the allocation to Match Group of certain IAC corporate expenses relating to Match Group based on the historical financial statements and accounting records of IAC through the date of the IPO.  Management believes the assumptions underlying the historical combined financial statements, including the basis on which expenses have been allocated, are reasonable and that the consolidated and combined financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.  The accompanying unaudited consolidated and combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  For the purposes of these financial statements, income taxes have been computed for Match Group on an as if stand-alone, separate tax return basis. 
  All intercompany transactions and balances between and among the Company, its subsidiaries and the entities comprising Match Group have been eliminated.  
  Accounting Estimates 
  Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP.  These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

MATCH GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to: the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets; the useful lives and recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment; the fair value of long-term investments; the carrying value of accounts receivable, including the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts; the determination of revenue reserves; the fair value of            acquisition-related contingent consideration arrangements; the liabilities for uncertain tax positions; the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets; and the fair value of and forfeiture rates for stock-based awards, among others.  The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, its forecasts and budgets and other factors that the Company considers relevant. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which makes clarifications to how cash receipts and cash payments in certain transactions are presented and classified on the statement of cash flows.  The provisions of ASU 2016-15 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods, and will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable; early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements; and is currently evaluating the method and timing of adoption. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payments Accounting (Topic 718).    The update is intended to simplify existing guidance on various aspects of the accounting and presentation of employee share-based payments in financial statements, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification on the statement of cash flows.  The provisions of ASU 2016-09 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; early adoption is permitted.   
  The primary effects of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on the Company s results of operations, cash flows and earnings per share will be due to the change in the treatment of the excess tax benefit (deficiency) related to equity awards to employees upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units.  The table below illustrates this effect.                       Excess tax benefit (deficiency) of equity awards to employees upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units: 
      
    Accounting under current GAAP: 
      
    Accounting following adoption of ASU 2016-09: 
      Statement of operations 
      
    Treated as an increase (or decrease) to additional paid-in capital when realized (i.e., reduction of income taxes payable) 
      
    Included in the determination of the income tax provision or benefit upon option exercise or share vesting 
      Statement of cash flows 
      
    Treated as a financing cash flow 
      
    Treated as an operating cash flow 
      Calculation of fully diluted shares for the determination of earnings per share 
      
    Included as a component of the assumed proceeds in applying the treasury stock method 
      
    Excluded from the assumed proceeds in applying the treasury stock method 

The expected effect of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 for the Company will be to increase reported net earnings (or reduce reported net loss) and increase operating cash flow and basic earnings per share (or reduce reported net loss per share).  The number of shares used in the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share will also increase due to the reduction in assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method.  The actual effect on fully diluted earnings per share could be an increase or a decrease in any period, which will depend upon the increase in reported earnings and the increase in the number of shares included in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation. 
  The Company will adopt the change in treatment of excess tax benefit (deficiency) as of January 1, 2017 using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial adoption and will apply the provisions of ASU 2016-09 related to the presentation on the statement of cash flows using the prospective approach.

To illustrate the effect of ASU 2016-09 on the Company s results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the table below illustrates the change in the Company s reported results after giving pro forma effect to ASU 2016-09 as if it had been in effect on January 1, 2016.   

  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in   "Leases (Topic 840)"   and generally requires all leases to be recognized in the statement of financial position.  The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted.  The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard update will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   and in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  .  Together, this guidance requires that deferred debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability, while debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements may still continue to be classified as assets.  The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 in the first quarter of 2016 and applied the provisions retrospectively, resulting in   $16.6 million   of deferred debt issuance costs being reclassified from other non-current assets to long-term debt, net of current maturities, in the accompanying December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common standard for all industries.  In July 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, respectively, which provide further revenue recognition guidance related to principal versus agent considerations, performance obligations and licensing, and narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients.  Early adoption is permitted beginning on the original effective date of December 15, 2016.  Upon adoption, ASU 2014-09 may either be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard update will have on its consolidated financial statements.  The Company will adopt this standard using the modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2018. 
   
  NOTE 2 INCOME TAXES 
  Match Group is a member of IAC's consolidated federal and state income tax returns.  In all periods presented, current income tax provision and deferred income tax benefit have been computed for Match Group on an as if stand-alone, separate return basis.  Match Group's payments to IAC for its share of IAC's consolidated federal and state tax return liabilities have been reflected within cash flows from operating activities in the accompanying consolidated and combined statement of cash flows. 
  At the end of each interim period, the Company makes its best estimate of the annual expected effective income tax rate and applies that rate to its ordinary year-to-date earnings or loss.  The income tax provision or benefit related to significant,  
  
   10 

MATCH GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

unusual, or extraordinary items, if applicable, that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effects are individually computed and recognized in the interim period in which they occur.  In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws or rates, tax status, judgment on the realizability of beginning-of-the-year deferred tax assets in future years or the liabilities for uncertain tax positions is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs. 
  The computation of the annual expected effective income tax rate at each interim period requires certain estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, the expected pre-tax income (or loss) for the year, projections of the proportion of income (and/or loss) earned and taxed in foreign jurisdictions, permanent and temporary differences, and the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets generated in the current year.  The accounting estimates used to compute the provision or benefit for income taxes may change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, additional information is obtained or our tax environment changes.  To the extent that the expected annual effective income tax rate changes during a quarter, the effect of the change on prior quarters is included in income tax provision in the quarter in which the change occurs. 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded an income tax provision of   $20.3 million   which represents an effective income tax rate of   26%  .  The effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   is lower than the statutory rate of   35%   due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates and the non-taxable gain on contingent consideration fair value adjustments.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded an income tax provision of   $39.2 million   which represents an effective income tax rate of   29%  .  The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is lower than the statutory rate of   35%   due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded an income tax provision of   $22.1 million  , which represents an effective income tax rate of   38%  .  The effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   is higher than the statutory rate of   35%   due primarily to state taxes.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded an income tax provision of   $42.6 million  , which represents an effective income tax rate of   33%  .  The effective rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   is lower than the statutory rate of   35%   due principally to the non-taxable gain on contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by state taxes. 
  The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had accrued   $1.4 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively, for the payment of interest.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has accrued   $1.7 million   and   $1.8 million  , respectively, for penalties. 
  Match Group is routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities in the area of income tax as a result of previously filed separate company tax returns and consolidated tax returns with IAC.  These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions.  The Internal Revenue Service is currently auditing IAC's federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2010 through 2012, which includes the operations of Match Group.  The statute of limitations for the years 2010 through 2012 has been extended to March 31, 2017.  Various other jurisdictions are open to examination for tax years beginning with 2009.  Income taxes payable include reserves considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns.  Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon the resolution of audits and amounts previously provided may be material.  Differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the Company are recorded in the period they become known. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, were   $24.7 million   and   $26.2 million  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   $15.7 million   and   $16.4 million  , respectively, were included in unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions included in IAC's consolidated tax return filings.  If unrecognized tax benefits at   September 30, 2016   are subsequently recognized,   $24.3 million  , net of related deferred tax assets and interest, would reduce income tax expense.  The comparable amount as of   December 31, 2015   was   $25.8 million  .  The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately   $6.8 million   within twelve months of   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to expirations of statutes of limitations. 
   
  NOTE 3 BUSINESS COMBINATION 
  On October 28, 2015, the Company completed the purchase of all the outstanding shares of Plentyoffish Media Inc. ("PlentyOfFish"), a leading provider of subscription-based and ad-supported online personals servicing North America, Europe,  
  
   11 

MATCH GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

Latin America and Australia.  Services are provided through websites and mobile applications that PlentyOfFish owns and operates.  The purchase price was   $574.1 million   in cash and is net of a   $0.9 million   working capital adjustment paid to the Company in the second quarter of 2016.  The financial results of PlentyOfFish are included in Match Group's consolidated financial statements, within the Dating segment, beginning October 28, 2015. 
  The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below presents the combined results of Match Group and PlentyOfFish as if the acquisition of PlentyOfFish had occurred on January 1, 2015.  The pro forma financial information includes adjustments required under the acquisition method of accounting and is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been achieved had the acquisition actually occurred on January 1, 2015.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , pro forma adjustments reflected below include decreases to revenue of   $0.6 million   and   $9.0 million  , respectively, related to the write-off of deferred revenue at the date of acquisition and increases of   $3.7 million   and   $12.7 million  , respectively in amortization of intangible assets. 

NOTE 4 MARKETABLE SECURITIES  
  At   December 31, 2015  , marketable securities consisted of an equity security that had a cost basis of   $8.7 million  , with gross unrealized gains of   $3.0 million   which was included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  This marketable security was sold in its entirety in the second quarter of 2016.  Proceeds and gross realized gains from the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities were   $11.7 million   and   $3.1 million  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
   
  NOTE 5 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  The Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: 
             
    Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 
                
    Level 2: Other inputs, which are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 
                
    Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and require the Company to develop its own assumptions, based on the best information available in the circumstances, about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.  See below for a discussion of fair value measurements made using Level 3 inputs. 
     The following tables present the Company's financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Contingent consideration arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there are   five   contingent consideration arrangements related to business acquisitions.  The maximum contingent payments related to these arrangements is   $97.6 million  .  The Company expects to make payments on   two   of the   five   contingent consideration arrangements and the aggregate fair value of these   two   arrangements at   September 30, 2016   is   $29.9 million  .  
  The contingent consideration arrangements are based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics such as monthly active users.  The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate, that appropriately captures the risks associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the financial statements.  The number of scenarios in the probability-weighted analyses can vary; generally, more scenarios are prepared for longer duration and more complex arrangements.  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the fair values of the contingent consideration arrangements outstanding,   two   in 2016 and   one   in 2015, reflect a   12%   discount rate. 
  The fair values of the contingent consideration arrangements are sensitive to changes in the forecasts of earnings and/or the relevant operating metrics and changes in discount rates.  The Company remeasures the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, and changes are recognized in  General and administrative expense  in the accompanying consolidated and combined statement of operations.   The contingent consideration arrangement liability at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 includes a current portion of   $29.7 million   and   $0  , respectively, and non-current portion of   $0.2 million   and   $29.0 million  , respectively, which are included in  Accrued expenses and other current liabilities  and  Other long-term liabilities,  respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
  Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
  The Company's non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as cost method investments, are adjusted to fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized.  Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs. 
  Cost method investments 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying values of the Company's investments accounted for under the cost method totaled   $55.4 million   and   $55.6 million  , respectively, and are included in "Long-term investments" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  The Company evaluates each cost method investment for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognizes an impairment loss if a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary.  If the Company has not

identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of a cost method investment, then the fair value of such cost method investment is not estimated, as it is impracticable to do so. 
  Financial instruments measured at fair value only for disclosure purposes 
  The following table presents the carrying value and the fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value only for disclosure purposes. 

The fair value of long-term debt including current maturities is estimated using market prices or indices for similar liabilities and taking into consideration other factors such as credit quality and maturity, which are Level 3 inputs.

   (a)     The Term Loan matures on November 16, 2022; provided that, if any of the 2015 Senior Notes remain outstanding on the date that is   91 days   prior to the maturity date of the 2015 Senior Notes, the Term Loan maturity date shall be the date that is   91 days   prior to the maturity date of the 2015 Senior Notes  . 
  Senior Notes  : 
  The 2016 Senior Notes were issued on June 1, 2016.  The proceeds of   $400 million   were used to repay a portion of indebtedness outstanding under the Term Loan.  At any time prior to June 1, 2019, these notes may be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the sum of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium.  Thereafter, these notes may be redeemed at the redemption prices set forth below, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on June 1 of the years indicated below:

The 2015 Senior Notes were issued on November 16, 2015, in exchange for a portion of IAC's   4.75%   Senior Notes due December 15, 2022 (the "IAC 2012 Senior Notes") (the "Match Exchange Offer").  Promptly following the Match Exchange Offer, the Company and its subsidiaries were designated as unrestricted subsidiaries of IAC for purposes of the indentures governing the IAC   4.875%   Senior Notes due November 30, 2018, the IAC 2012 Senior Notes and the IAC Credit Facility.      Following this designation, neither Match Group nor any of its subsidiaries guarantee any debt of IAC, or are subject to any of the covenants related to such debt. 
  The indentures governing the 2016 and 2015 Senior Notes contain covenants that would limit the Company's ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem Match Group stock in the event a default has occurred or Match Group's leverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) exceeds   5.0   to 1.0.  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   limitations pursuant thereto.  There are additional covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur indebtedness, make investments, or sell assets in the event the Company is not in compliance with the financial ratio set forth in the indenture, and (ii) incur liens, enter into agreements restricting the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of their assets. 
  Term Loan and Credit Facility  : 
  On November 16, 2015, under a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), the Company borrowed   $800 million   in the form of a term loan (the "Term Loan").  On March 31, 2016, the Company made a   $10 million   principal payment on the Term Loan.  In addition, on June 1, 2016, the   $400 million   in proceeds from the 2016 Senior Notes were used to repay a portion of the Term Loan.  The remaining principal balance at September 30, 2016 of   $390 million   is due at maturity.  The Term Loan provides for additional annual principal payments as part of an excess cash flow sweep provision, the amount of which, if any, is governed by the secured net leverage ratio contained in the Credit Agreement.  The Term Loan bears interest, at our option, at a base rate or LIBOR, plus   3.50%   or   4.50%  , respectively, and in the case of LIBOR, a floor of   1.00%  .  Interest payments are due at least semi-annually through the term of the loan.   
  The Company has a   $500 million   revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") that expires on October 7, 2020.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.  The annual commitment fee on undrawn funds based on the current leverage ratio is   30 basis points  .  Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at a base rate or LIBOR, in each case plus an applicable margin, which is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio.  The terms of the Credit Facility require the Company to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of not more than   5.0   to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than   2.5   to 1.0. 
  There are additional covenants under the Credit Facility and the Term Loan that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions.  While the Term Loan remains outstanding, these same covenants under the Credit Agreement are more restrictive than the covenants that are applicable to the Credit Facility.  Obligations under the Credit Facility and Term Loan are unconditionally guaranteed by certain Match Group wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, and are also secured by the stock of certain Match Group domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  The Term Loan and outstanding borrowings, if any, under the Credit Facility rank equally with each other, and have priority over the 2016 and 2015 Senior Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing the borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

   (a)     If the effect is dilutive, weighted average common shares outstanding include the incremental shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise of subsidiary denominated equity and stock options or vesting of restricted stock units ("RSUs").  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   0.4 million   and   11.2 million   potentially dilutive securities, respectively, are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , all potentially dilutive securities were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were dilutive. 
   (b)     Market-based awards and performance-based stock options ("PSOs") and units ( PSUs ) are considered contingently issuable shares.  Market-based awards, PSOs and PSUs are included in the denominator for earnings per share if (i) the applicable market or performance condition(s) has been met and (ii) the inclusion of the market-based award, PSOs and PSUs are dilutive for the respective reporting periods.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   7.1 million   market-based awards, PSOs and PSUs were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the market or performance conditions had not been met.

Revenue by geography is based on where the customer is located.  Geographic information about revenue and long-lived assets is presented below: 

The United States is the only country whose revenue is greater than 10 percent of total revenue for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

The only country, other than the United States, with greater than 10 percent of total long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets), was France with   $14.3 million   and   $14.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The Company's primary financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements.  The Company believes this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors.  Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our

individual business segments.  The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.  Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to Match Group's statement of operations of certain expenses. 
  The following tables reconcile operating income (loss) for the Company's reportable segments and net earnings attributable to Match Group, Inc. shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA:

NOTE 10 CONTINGENCIES 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a party to various lawsuits.  The Company establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable.  Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established.  Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results

of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.  The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and       non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss.  It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of   one   or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company.  See Note 2 for additional information related to income tax contingencies. 
   
  NOTE 11 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

  NOTE 12 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  Relationship with IAC pre-IPO 
  For periods prior to the IPO, the Company's consolidated and combined statement of operations includes allocations of general and administrative costs, including stock-based compensation expense, related to IAC's accounting, treasury, legal, tax, corporate support and internal audit functions.  These allocations were based on Match Group's revenue as a percentage of IAC's total revenue.  Allocated general and administrative costs, inclusive of stock-based compensation expense, were   $2.0 million   and   $5.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, and are included in "General and administrative expense" in the accompanying consolidated and combined statement of operations.  It is not practicable to determine the actual expenses that would have been incurred for these services had the Company operated as a stand-alone entity.  Management considers the allocation method to be reasonable.   
  Relationship with IAC post IPO 
  In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into certain agreements relating to our relationship with IAC after the IPO.  These agreements include a master transaction agreement; an investor rights agreement; a tax sharing agreement; a services agreement; an employee matters agreement and a subordinated loan agreement. 
  The Company has entered into certain arrangements with IAC in the ordinary course of business, which have continued post IPO, for: (i) the leasing of office space for certain of our businesses at properties owned by IAC, for which we paid IAC approximately   $1.1 million   and   $3.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $0.4 million   and   $1.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively; and (ii) the subleasing of space in a data center from an IAC subsidiary, for which we paid such IAC subsidiary approximately   $0.3 million   and   $0.9 million   for both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company was charged   $2.9 million   and   $8.7 million  , respectively, by IAC for services rendered pursuant to a services agreement (including the leasing of office space noted above).  This amount was paid in full by the Company at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The employee matters agreement provides, among other things, that: (i) with respect to equity awards denominated in shares of certain of the Company s subsidiaries, IAC may elect to cause such equity awards to be settled in either shares of IAC common stock or Company common stock and, to the extent that shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement of such equity awards, the Company will reimburse IAC for the cost of such shares of IAC common stock by issuing to IAC additional shares of Company common stock; and (ii) the Company will reimburse IAC for the cost of any IAC equity awards held by the Company s employees and former employees and that IAC may elect to receive payment either in cash or Company common stock. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   0.9 million   shares of Company common stock were issued to IAC pursuant to the employee matters agreement;   0.5 million   shares were issued as reimbursement for shares of IAC common stock

issued in connection with the exercise and settlement of equity awards denominated in shares of a subsidiary of the Company; and   0.4 million   shares were issued as reimbursement for shares of IAC common stock issued in connection with the exercise and vesting of IAC equity awards held by Company employees. 
   
  NOTE 13 STREAMLINING OF TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND CONSOLIDATION OF EUROPEAN OPERATIONS 
  The Company is currently in the process of modernizing and streamlining its underlying Dating technology infrastructure that supports both its mobile and desktop platforms, as well as consolidating its European operations from   seven   principal locations down to   three  .  The project is substantially complete and is expected to be fully completed by the end of   2016  .  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $0.8 million   and   $4.3 million   in costs related to this project, respectively, compared to   $2.5 million   and   $14.8 million  , for   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.  A summary of the costs incurred, payments made and the related accruals at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented below. 

The costs are allocated as follows in the accompanying consolidated and combined statement of operations:

  GENERAL 
  Key Terms: 
  When the following terms appear in this report, they have the meanings indicated below: 
             
    Reportable Segments 
                
    Dating   - consists of all of our dating businesses globally.  
                
    Non-dating   - consists of The Princeton Review. 
                
    Dating North America   - consists of the financial results of our Dating businesses for customers located in the United States and Canada. 
                
    Dating International   - consists of the financial results of our Dating businesses for customers located outside of the United States and Canada. 
                
    Direct Revenue   - is revenue that is directly received from an end user of our products. 
                
    Indirect Revenue   - is revenue that is not received directly from an end user of our products, substantially all of which is advertising revenue. 
                
    Average PMC   - is calculated by summing the number of paid members, or paid member count ("PMC"), at the end of each day in the relevant measurement period and dividing it by the number of calendar days in that period.  PMC as of any given time represents the number of users with a paid membership at that time.  Users who purchase   la carte features from us do not qualify as paid members for purposes of PMC by virtue of such purchase, though often such purchasers are also paid members. 
                
    Average Revenue Per Paying User ("ARPPU")   - is Direct Revenue in the relevant measurement period divided by the Average PMC in such period divided by the number of calendar days in such period. 
                
    Cost of revenue -   consists primarily of compensation (including stock-based compensation) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in data center and customer care functions, in-app purchase fees, credit card processing fees, hosting fees, and data center rent, energy and bandwidth costs.  In-app purchase fees are monies paid to Apple and Google for the distribution and facilitation of in-app purchases of product features. 
                
    Selling and marketing expense -   consists primarily of advertising expenditures and compensation (including    stock-based compensation) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in selling and marketing, and sales support functions.  Advertising expenditures includes online marketing, including fees paid to search engines, offline marketing (which is primarily television advertising), and partner-related payments to those who direct traffic to our brands. 
                
    General and administrative expense -   consists primarily of compensation (including stock-based compensation) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in executive management, finance, legal, tax and human resources, acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments (described below), fees for professional services and facilities costs. 
                
    Product development expense -   consists primarily of compensation (including stock-based compensation) and other employee-related costs that are not capitalized for personnel engaged in the design, development, testing and enhancement of product offerings and related technology. 
                
    Acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments   - relate to the portion of the purchase price (of certain acquisitions) that is contingent upon the future operating performance of the acquired company.  The amounts ultimately paid are generally dependent upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics as stipulated in the relevant share purchase agreements.  A liability is estimated at the date of acquisition and adjusted each reporting period until the liability is settled.  If the payment date of the liability is longer than one year, the amount is initially recorded net of a discount, which is amortized as an expense each period.  In a period where the acquired company is expected to perform better than the previous estimate, the liability will be increased resulting in additional expense; and in a period when the acquired company is expected to perform worse than the previous estimate, the liability will be decreased resulting in income.  The year-over-year impact can be significant if there is income in one period and expense in the other period.

  2016 Development 
  On June 1, 2016, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due June 1, 2024, with interest payable each June 1 and December 1, which commences on December 1, 2016.  The proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Term Loan. 
  Third Quarter and Year to Date September 2016 Consolidated Results  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , revenue, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA grew   18%  ,   57%   and   34%  , respectively.  Revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in Direct Revenue with a strong contribution from Tinder, the acquisition of PlentyOfFish, which was acquired on October 28, 2015, and Eureka.  The growth in operating income and Adjusted EBITDA was due primarily to higher revenue and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue as our sales mix continues to shift towards brands with lower marketing spend.  Operating income was further impacted by income in the current year period of $5.1 million from acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments compared to expense of $0.8 million in the prior year and lower stock-based compensation expense of $1.9 million, partially offset by higher depreciation expense of $1.9 million. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , revenue, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA grew   20%  ,   55%   and   54%  , respectively.  Revenue, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to the factors described above in the three-month discussion, as well as from the acquisition of Eureka on April 24, 2015.  Operating income and Adjusted EBITDA also benefited from a decrease of $10.5 million in costs related to the consolidation and streamlining of our technology systems and European operations at our Dating business ($4.3 million in 2016 compared to $14.8 million in 2015).  Operating income was further impacted by income in the current year period of $2.7 million from acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments compared to income of $11.5 million in the prior year and increases of $10.4 million and $5.4 million in stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles, respectively.

  Revenue 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 
  Revenue increased   $47.5 million  , or   18%  , in 2016 versus 2015.  Revenue during the period was favorably impacted by a strong contribution from Tinder, the acquisition of PlentyOfFish (acquired October 2015) and Eureka. 
  North America Direct Revenue grew   $23.7 million  , or   16%  , in 2016 versus 2015, driven by   26%   growth in Average PMC, partially offset by an   8%   decline in ARPPU.  Average PMC growth was driven by higher beginning PMC, growth in new users and an increase in the percentage of new users becoming paid members.  ARPPU decreased due to the continued mix shift towards lower ARPPU brands including Tinder and PlentyOfFish, both of which have lower price points compared to our more established brands, partially offset by increases in mix-adjusted rates. 
  International Direct Revenue grew   $25.5 million  , or   34%  , in 2016 versus 2015, primarily driven by   46%   growth in Average PMC, partially offset by an   8%   decline in ARPPU.  Average PMC growth was driven by higher beginning PMC, growth in new users, and an increase in the percentage of new users becoming paid members.  The decline in ARPPU was due to mix shifts to lower rate brands.

  Revenue increased   $150.0 million  , or   20%  , in 2016 versus 2015 primarily driven by the factors described above in the three-month discussion and the acquisition and continued growth of Eureka (acquired April 2015). 
  North America Direct Revenue grew   $73.2 million  , or   17%  , in 2016 versus 2015, driven by   25%   growth in Average PMC, partially offset by a   7%   decline in ARPPU.  Average PMC growth was driven by the factors described above in the three-month discussion.  ARPPU declines were primarily driven by the factors described above in the three-month discussion. 
  International Direct Revenue grew   $73.1 million  , or   36%  , in 2016 versus 2015, primarily driven by   49%   growth in Average PMC, partially offset by a   10%   decline in ARPPU.  Average PMC growth was driven by the factors described above in the three-month discussion.  The decline in ARPPU was due to mix shifts to lower rate brands and a decrease in mix-adjusted rates. 
  Non-dating revenue decreased   $5.0 million   driven by the factors described above in the three-month discussion. 
  Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation) 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 

Cost of revenue increased   $13.5 million  , or   28%  , in 2016 versus 2015. 
  Dating cost of revenue increased $15.1 million, or 42%, outpacing revenue growth, driven primarily by a significant increase in in-app purchase fees across multiple brands, including Tinder, and the acquisition of PlentyOfFish. 
  Non-dating cost of revenue decreased $1.6 million, or 13%, driven by a mix shift to higher margin online products from in-person courses. 
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015

Selling and marketing expense 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 

Selling and marketing expense increased   $2.7 million  , or   3%  , but declined as a percentage of revenue as the product mix at Dating continues to shift towards brands with lower marketing spend. 
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 

Selling and marketing expense increased   $4.2 million  , or   1%  , but declined as a percentage of revenue, due primarily to the factor described above in the three-month discussion. 
  General and administrative expense 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 

General and administrative expense decreased   $6.3 million  , or   14%  , in 2016 versus 2015. 
  Dating general and administrative expense decreased $1.7 million, or 5%, driven primarily by a change of $5.9 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by an increase of $2.4 million in compensation.  The change in the acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was due to income of $5.1 million in the current year period compared to expense of $0.8 million in the prior year period.  The increase in compensation is driven by increased headcount from recent acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the inclusion in 2015 of a modification charge related to certain equity awards, partially offset by the issuance of new equity awards since the prior year.   
  Non-dating general and administrative expense decreased $4.6 million, or 32%, driven primarily by a favorable resolution of a non-income tax related matter and a decrease in consulting expenses.

The change in the acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was due to income of $2.7 million in the current year period compared to income of $11.5 million in the prior year period.  The increase in compensation is due to an increase in headcount from recent acquisitions and a $4.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the issuance of new equity awards since the prior year, partially offset by the inclusion in 2015 of a modification charge related to certain equity awards.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 
  Operating income and Adjusted EBITDA increased   $33.4 million  , or   57%  , and   $28.1 million  , or   34%  , respectively, in 2016 versus 2015. 
  Dating operating income and Adjusted EBITDA increased $31.9 million, or 54%, and $26.8 million, or 33%, respectively, as a result of the increase in revenue of $52.4 million and a decrease in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue resulting from continued mix shifts towards brands with lower marketing spend, partially offset by the increase in cost of revenue.  Additionally, costs incurred related to the consolidation and streamlining of our technology systems and European operations were $0.8 million, a decline of $1.8 million compared to the prior year period.  Operating income was further impacted by income in the current year period of $5.1 million from acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments compared to expense of $0.8 million in the prior year and lower stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million partially offset by higher depreciation expense of $2.2 million. 
  Non-dating operating loss improved $1.5 million to income of $0.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA improved $1.3 million, or 55%, primarily due to reduced losses as a result of a mix-shift to higher margin online products from in-person courses, a favorable resolution of a non-income tax related matter, and a decrease in consulting expenses.  Operating income in the current year period was further impacted by lower depreciation in 2016. 
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 
  Operating income and Adjusted EBITDA increased   $68.7 million  , or   55%  , and   $96.1 million  , or   54%  , respectively, in 2016 versus 2015. 
  Dating operating income and Adjusted EBITDA increased $59.7 million, or 42%, and $90.8 million, or 49%, respectively, primarily due to the factors described above in the three-month discussion.  Operating income was further impacted by $8.8 million in changes from acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and increases in stock-based compensation expense of $10.6 million, which is due to the issuance of new equity awards and a net increase in expense associated with the modification of certain equity awards since the prior year period, $5.9 million in additional amortization of intangibles, which is due to acquisitions that occurred in 2015, and $5.8 million in additional depreciation, which is due to acquisitions and assets being placed in service.  The change in the acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was the result of income of $2.7 million in the current year period compared to income of $11.5 million in the prior year period. 
  Non-dating operating loss and Adjusted EBITDA loss decreased $9.0 million, or 53%, and $5.3 million, or 93%, respectively, driven by the factors described above in the three-month discussion. 
  At September 30, 2016, there was $96.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.8 years.

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Financial Position 

(1)   
    Domestically, cash equivalents include $50.0 million of AAA rated treasury money market funds at September 30, 2016; the balance reflects cash deposits held in financial institutions. 
               (2)   
    Internationally, cash equivalents include $1.8 million of money market funds at September 30, 2016; the balance reflects cash deposits held in financial institutions.  If needed for our U.S. operations, most of the cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated, which, under current tax law, would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes.  We currently do not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to finance our U.S. operations and it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the U.S.; therefore, we have not provided for any U.S. income taxes related to these funds. 
               (3)   
    Proceeds from the 2016 Senior Notes were used to repay a portion of the Term Loan.  A final principal payment of   $390 million   is due at maturity. 
               (4)   
    The Term Loan matures on November 16, 2022; provided that, if any of the 2015 Senior Notes remain outstanding on the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2015 Senior Notes, the Term Loan maturity date shall be the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2015 Senior Notes. 
     Senior Notes: 
  On June 1, 2016, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% of Senior Notes due June 1, 2024.  
  Promptly following the closing of the Match Exchange Offer on November 16, 2015, the Company and its subsidiaries were designated as unrestricted subsidiaries of IAC for purposes of the indentures governing the IAC 4.875% Senior Notes due November 30, 2018, the IAC Senior Notes and the IAC Credit Facility.  Following this designation, neither Match Group nor any of its subsidiaries guarantee any debt of IAC, or are subject to any of the covenants related to such debt. 
  The indentures governing the 2016 and 2015 Senior Notes contain covenants that would limit the Company's ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem Match Group stock in the event a default has occurred or  
  
   35 

Match Group's leverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0.  At September 30, 2016, Match Group was in compliance with all applicable covenants. 
  Term Loan and Credit Facility: 
  On November 16, 2015, under a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), the Company borrowed $800 million in the form of a term loan (the "Term Loan").  On March 31, 2016, the Company made a $10.0 million principal payment on the Term Loan.  In addition, on June 1, 2016, the $400 million in proceeds from the 2016 Senior Notes were used to repay a portion of the Term Loan and, as a result, quarterly principal payments of $10.0 million under the Term Loan are no longer due.  The remaining principal balance at September 30, 2016 of $390 million is due at maturity.  The Term Loan provides for additional annual principal payments as part of an excess cash flow sweep provision, the amount of which, if any, is governed by the secured net leverage ratio contained in the Credit Agreement.  The Term Loan bears interest, at our option, at a base rate or LIBOR, plus 3.50% or 4.50%, respectively, and in the case of LIBOR, a floor of 1.00%.  Interest payments are due at least semi-annually through the term of the loan. 
  The Company has a $500 million revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") that expires on October 7, 2020.  The annual commitment fee on undrawn funds based on the current leverage ratio is   30 basis points  .  Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at a base rate or LIBOR, in each case plus an applicable margin, which is determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio.  The terms of the Credit Facility require the Company to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of not more than 5.0 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.5 to 1.0. 
  There are additional covenants under the Credit Facility and the Term Loan that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions.  While the Term Loan remains outstanding, these same covenants under the Credit Agreement are more restrictive than the covenants that are applicable to the Credit Facility.  Obligations under the Credit Facility and Term Loan are unconditionally guaranteed by certain Match Group wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, and are also secured by the stock of certain Match Group domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  The Term Loan and outstanding borrowings, if any, under the Credit Facility rank equally with each other, and have priority over the 2016 and 2015 Senior Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing the borrowings under the Credit Agreement. 
  IAC Subordinated Loan Facility: 
  Prior to the IPO, the Company entered into an uncommitted subordinated loan facility with IAC (the "IAC Subordinated Loan Facility"), which allows the Company to make one or more requests to IAC to borrow funds from it.  If IAC agrees to fulfill any such borrowing request from the Company, such borrowing will be incurred in accordance with the terms of the IAC Subordinated Loan Facility.  Any indebtedness outstanding under the IAC Subordinated Loan Facility will be by its terms subordinated in right of payment to the obligations under the Credit Facility, the Term Loan and the 2015 and 2016 Senior Notes.  The IAC Subordinated Loan Facility has a scheduled final maturity date of no earlier than 90 days after the maturity date of the Credit Facility or the latest maturity date in respect of any Term Loan outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  At September 30, 2016, the Company has no indebtedness outstanding under the IAC Subordinated Loan Facility. 
  Cash Flow Information 
  In summary, the Company's cash flows are as follows: 

2016 
  Net cash provided by operating activities consists of earnings adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, deferred income taxes, acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value  
  
   36 

adjustments, excess tax benefits and the effect of changes from working capital activities.  Adjustments to earnings primarily consist of   $41.3 million   of stock-based compensation expense,   $22.6 million   of depreciation,   $19.6 million   of amortization of intangibles,   $25.9 million   in excess tax benefits,   $2.7 million   in gains from acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and $1.8 million in other adjustments that consist primarily of a non-cash charge on the repayment of $400 million of the Term Loan, partially offset by foreign currency exchange gains on intercompany loans.  The increase in cash from changes in working capital primarily consists of an increase in deferred revenue of   $26.1 million  , due mainly to growth in membership revenue, partially offset by an increase in other assets of   $10.1 million   primarily related to the prepayment of certain expenses. 
  Net cash used in investing activities in 2016 consists primarily of capital expenditures of   $39.1 million   that are related to the internal development of software to support our products and services, as well as computer equipment and leasehold improvements as we continue to grow and expand our operations at Dating, partially offset by the proceeds of   $11.7 million   from the sale of a marketable security. 
  Net cash used in financing activities in 2016 mainly relates to the payment of $410.0 million toward the Term Loan, of which $400.0 million was financed by the issuance of the 2016 Senior Notes. 
  2015 
  Adjustments to earnings primarily consist of   $31.0 million   of stock-based compensation expense,   $19.8 million   of depreciation and   $14.1 million   of amortization of intangibles, partially offset by   $31.3 million   in excess tax benefits from stock-based awards,   $11.5 million   of acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, $11.3 million of other adjustments, which mainly relate to non-cash foreign currency exchange gains on related party debt, and $8.6 million of deferred income taxes.  The increase in cash from changes from working capital is due primarily to an increase in income taxes payable of   $27.0 million  , an increase of   $24.0 million   in deferred revenue and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of   $20.8 million  , partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of   $25.1 million   and an increase in other current assets of   $7.4 million  .  The increase in income taxes payable is due to current year income tax accruals in excess of current year income tax payments.  The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to growth in membership fees in the Dating business, a seasonal increase in class enrollment in the Non-dating business and acquisitions.  The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities is primarily due to increased online spending, the timing of marketing payments and costs associated with the consolidation and streamlining of technology systems and European operations at the Dating business.  The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to growth from in-app purchases sold through Dating's mobile products.  The increase in other current assets is primarily due to an increase in prepaid expenses and VAT refund receivables.  
  Net cash used in investing activities in 2015 includes cash consideration used in acquisitions of   $40.7 million   and capital expenditures of   $19.9 million  , primarily related to the internal development of software to support our products and services. 
  Net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 includes net cash transfers of   $75.9 million   from IAC and   $31.3 million   in excess tax benefits from stock-based awards, partially offset by   $5.5 million   in contingent consideration payments.  The net cash transfers include a $155.0 million capital contribution to partially fund the PlentyOfFish acquisition, partially offset by cash transfers to IAC of $79.1 million that relate to IAC's centrally managed U.S. treasury management function. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The Company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash flows generated from operations as well as cash and cash equivalents.  The Company has a $500 million Credit Facility that expires on October 7, 2020.  At September 30, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. 
  The Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. The Company's 2016 capital expenditures will be higher than 2015 by approximately 50% to 60%, driven primarily by leasehold improvements related to a new lease for the Company's corporate headquarters and costs related to a new data center. 
  The Company believes its expected positive cash flows generated from operations together with its existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future.  The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services.  Our indebtedness could limit our ability to: (i)  
  
   37 

obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures or debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make acquisitions, capital expenditures, invest in other areas, such as developing properties and exploiting business opportunities.  IAC owns 82.8% of our outstanding shares of capital stock and has approximately 98.0% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.  As a result of IAC's ability to control the election and removal of our board of directors, IAC effectively has the ability to control our financing activities, including the issuance of additional debt and equity securities, or the incurrence of other indebtedness.  While the Company believes we will have the ability to access debt and equity markets if needed, such transactions may require the concurrence of IAC. 
  
   38 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS 
  At September 30, 2016, except as noted below, there have been no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations, commercial commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements since the disclosure in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  The Company has total long-term debt of $1.2 billion at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  On June 1, 2016, the Company issued $400 million of 6.375% Senior Notes.  The proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the $790 million of indebtedness outstanding under the Term Loan.  Following the payment, $390 million of the Term Loan is outstanding.  The Term Loan currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 4.50%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, or 5.50%.  Based on this transaction, the Company will incur approximately $100 million of additional interest expense over the term of its debt obligations due to the higher interest rate and the longer maturity of the 2016 Senior Notes, due June 1, 2024, as compared to the Term Loan, due November 16, 2022.

MATCH GROUP, INC.'S PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING 
  Match Group reports Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.  We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results.  This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.  Match Group endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure.  We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below. 
  Definition of Match Group's Non-GAAP Measures 
  Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA")   is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements.  We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors.  Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments.  The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.  Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our consolidated and combined statement of operations of certain expenses. 
  Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From Match Group's Adjusted EBITDA 
  Stock-based compensation   expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance-based RSUs.  These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method.  Upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of RSUs and performance-based RSUs, the awards are settled, at the Company's discretion, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds. 
  Depreciation   is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives. 
  Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets   are non-cash expenses.  At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as customer lists, trade names, content, technology and franchise rights are valued and amortized over their estimated lives.  Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization.  An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value.  We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of goodwill or intangible assets, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business. 
  Gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements   are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value.  These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or ongoing costs of doing business.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA 
  For a reconciliation of operating income (loss) by reportable segment and net earnings attributable to Match Group, Inc. shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, see Note 9 to the consolidated and combined financial statements.

Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
  At September 30, 2016, the Company's outstanding debt was $1.2 billion, which consists of $845.2 million of Match Group Senior Notes, which bear interest at fixed rates, and a $390 million Term Loan, which bears interest at a variable rate.  If market rates decline, the Company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates.  A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by $46.1 million.  Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of fixed-rate debt and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.  The Term Loan currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 4.50%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, or 5.50%.  LIBOR at September 30, 2016 for similar borrowings of three months was approximately 85 basis points.  If LIBOR were to increase by 100 basis points then the annual interest payments on the Term Loan would increase by 85 basis points, or $3.4 million, in 2016.  If LIBOR decreased 85 basis points to zero, annual interest payments on the Term Loan would remain the same because of the 1% floor.  Such potential changes in interest payments are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant rate of variable-rate debt and an immediate across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
  The Company conducts business in certain foreign markets, primarily in the European Union. 
  While historically foreign currency exchange gains and losses have not been material to the Company, the significant decline in the British Pound ("GBP") due to the Brexit vote generated significant foreign currency exchange gains during 2016, which total $14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  This gain is primarily related to a U.S. dollar denominated intercompany loan related to a recent acquisition in which the receivable is held by a foreign subsidiary with a GBP functional currency.  
    
  If the GBP had declined a further 10% further versus the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the gain would have been greater by $2.5 million and if the GBP had declined 10% less versus the U.S. dollar the gain would have been reduced by $2.0 million.   
  Historically, the Company has not hedged foreign currency exposures.  Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.

Item 4.      Controls and Procedures 
  The Company monitors and evaluates on an ongoing basis its disclosure controls and procedures in order to improve their overall effectiveness.  In the course of these evaluations, the Company modifies and refines its internal processes as conditions warrant. 
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, Match Group management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), conducted an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e).  Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
  OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.    Legal Proceedings 
    
  Overview 
    
  We are, and from time to time may become, involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business activities, such as patent infringement claims, trademark oppositions and consumer or advertising complaints, as well as stockholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits and other matters. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage. Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See "Item 1A-Risk factors Risks relating to our business We are subject to litigation and adverse outcomes in such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition" of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require the description of material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary, routine litigation incident to the registrant s business) and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not exceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In the judgment of Match Group management, none of the pending litigation matters which we are defending, including those described below, involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude. The litigation matters described below involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to our stockholders, regardless of whether any of these matters may be material to our financial position or operations based upon the standard set forth in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
    
  Securities Class Action Litigation against Match Group 
    
  As previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016, on February 26, 2016, a putative nationwide class action was filed in federal court in Texas against the Company, five of its officers and directors, and twelve underwriters of the Company s initial public offering in November 2015.    See David M. Stein v. Match Group, Inc. et al.  , No. 3:16-cv-549 (U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas).  The complaint alleged that the Company s registration statement and prospectus issued in connection with its initial public offering were materially false and misleading given their failure to state that: (i) the Company s Non-dating business would miss its revenue projection for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, and (ii) ARPPU (as defined in "Item 2-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-General-Key Terms") would decline substantially in the quarter ended December 31, 2015.  The complaint asserted that these alleged failures to timely disclose material information caused the Company s stock price to drop after the announcement of its earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.  The complaint pleaded claims under the Securities Act of 1933 for untrue statements of material fact in, or omissions of material facts from, the registration statement, the prospectus, and related communications in violation of Sections 11 and 12 and, as to the officer/director defendants only, control-person liability under Section 15 for the Company s alleged violations.  The complaint sought class certification, damages in an unspecified amount and attorneys  fees.  On March 9, 2016, a virtually identical class action complaint was filed in the same court against the same defendants by a different named plaintiff.    See Stephany Kam-Wan Chan v. Match Group, Inc. et al.  , No. 3:16-cv-668 (U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas).  On April 25, 2016, Judge Boyle in the   Chan   case issued an order granting the parties  joint motion to transfer that case to Judge Lindsay, who was presiding over the earlier-filed   Stein   case.  On April 27, 2016, various current or former shareholders in the Company and their respective law firms filed motions seeking appointment as lead plaintiff(s) and lead or liaison counsel for the putative class.  On April 28, 2016, the Court issued orders: (i) consolidating the   Chan   case into the   Stein   case, (ii) approving the parties  stipulation to extend the defendants  time to respond to the complaint until after the Court has appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel for the putative class and has set a schedule for the plaintiff s filing of a consolidated complaint and the defendants  response to that pleading, and (iii) referring the various motions for appointment of lead plaintiff(s) and lead or liaison counsel for the putative class to a United States Magistrate Judge for determination.  On June 9, 2016, the Magistrate Judge issued an order appointing two lead plaintiffs, two law firms as co-lead plaintiffs  counsel, and a third law firm as plaintiffs  liaison counsel.  In accordance with this order, the consolidated case is now captioned   Mary McCloskey et ano. v. Match Group, Inc. et al.  , No. 3:16-CV-549-L.  On July 27, 2016, the parties submitted to the Court a joint status report proposing a schedule for the plaintiffs  filing of a consolidated amended complaint and the parties  briefing of the defendants  contemplated motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint.      On August 17, 2016, the Court issued an order  
  
   44 

approving the parties  proposed schedule.  On September 9, 2016, in accordance with the schedule, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint.  The new pleading focuses solely on allegedly misleading statements or omissions concerning the Company s Non-dating business.  The defendants will file motions to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint on or before November 8, 2016.  The Company believes that the allegations in this lawsuit are without merit and will defend vigorously against them. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The use of words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "plans" and "believes," among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: Match Group's future financial performance, Match Group's business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and prospects in the industries in which Match Group's businesses operate and other similar matters. These forward-looking statements are based on Match Group management's current expectations and assumptions about future events as of the date of this quarterly report, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.           
  Actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others: These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: Match Group s future financial performance, Match Group s business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and other similar matters.  These forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations and assumptions about future events, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.  Actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others: competition, our ability to maintain user rates on our higher monetizing dating products, our ability to attract users to our dating products through cost-effective marketing and related efforts, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, our ability to distribute our dating products through third parties and offset related fees, the integrity and scalability of our systems and infrastructure (and those of third parties) and our ability to adapt ours to changes in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to  protect our systems from cyberattacks and to protect personal and confidential user information, risks relating to certain of our international operations and acquisitions and certain risks relating to our relationship with IAC/InterActiveCorp, among other risks.  
    
  Certain of these and other risks and uncertainties are discussed in Match Group s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in Part I "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect Match Group's business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time.  In light of these risks and uncertainties, these forward-looking statements discussed in this quarterly report may not prove to be accurate.  Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which only reflect the views of Match Group management as of the date of this quarterly report.  Match Group does not undertake to update these forward-looking statements. 

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  The Employee Matters Agreement dated as of November 24, 2015, by and between IAC/InterActiveCorp ( IAC ) and the Company, as amended effective as of April 13, 2016 (the  Employee Matters Agreement ), provides. among other things, that the Company will reimburse IAC for the cost of any IAC equity awards held by the Company s employees and former employees and that IAC may elect to receive payment either in cash or Company common stock. 
    
  Pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, 16,848 shares of Company common stock were issued to IAC on September 28, 2016 as reimbursement for shares of IAC common stock issued in connection with the exercise of IAC stock options held by Match Group employees. 
     
  None of the above issuances involved any underwriters or public offerings and we believe that each issuance was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of such act.

Exhibit 10.1 

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT  
  THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (   Agreement   ) is entered by and between Jared Sine (   Executive   ) and Match Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the    Company   ) and is effective as of July 5, 2016 (the    Effective Date   ).   
  WHEREAS, the Company desires to establish its right to the services of Executive, in the capacity described below, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, and Executive is willing to accept such employment on such terms and conditions. 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter set forth, Executive and the Company have agreed and do hereby agree as follows: 
  1A.      EMPLOYMENT  . During the Term (as defined below), the Company shall employ Executive, and Executive shall be employed, as the General Counsel and Secretary of the Company; provided that Executive s designation as Secretary shall be effective upon his appointment to such office by the Company s Board of Directors.

  2A.      TERM  . This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of one (1) year.  This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for successive one-year periods (ending on each anniversary of the Effective Date) unless one party hereto provides written notice to the other, at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then current one-year employment period, that it elects not to extend this Agreement, which notice shall be irrevocable (any such notice, a    Non-Renewal Notice   ).  The period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the first anniversary hereof or, if the Agreement is renewed pursuant to the prior sentence, the last day of the last one-year renewal period, shall be referred to hereinafter as the    Term  .   Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Executive s employment with the Company is  at will  and may be terminated at any time for any reason or no reason, with or without cause, by the Company or Executive.

The Base Salary may be increased from time to time in the discretion of the Company.  For all purposes under this Agreement, the term    Base Salary    shall refer to the Base Salary as in effect from time to time.

STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
  1.        TERMINATION OF EXECUTIVE S EMPLOYMENT. 
  (a)        DEATH  . In the event Executive s employment hereunder is terminated by reason of Executive s death, the Company shall pay Executive s designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, within thirty (30) days of Executive s death in a lump sum in cash, (i) Executive s Base Salary through the end of the month in which death occurs and (ii) any Accrued Obligations (as defined in paragraph 1(f) below).  
  (b)        DISABILITY  .

breach, the nature of the willful or gross neglect or the violation that the Company believes constitutes Cause.  
  (d)        TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY OTHER THAN FOR DEATH, DISABILITY OR CAUSE OR RESIGNATION BY EXECUTIVE FOR GOOD REASON  . If Executive s employment hereunder is terminated prior to the expiration of the Term by the Company for any reason other than Executive s death or Disability or for Cause, or if Executive terminates his employment hereunder prior to the expiration of the Term for Good Reason, then:

A  ny severance benefits due to Executive pursuant to Section 1(d)(i) shall be paid in equal biweekly installments (or, if different, in accordance with the Company s payroll practice as in effect   from time to time, but no less often than monthly  ) over the course of the twelve (12) month period beginning on the first business day of the second month following the month in which Executive s Separation from Service (as such term is defined in paragraph 7) took place.  
    
  For purposes of this Agreement,  Good Reason  shall mean the occurrence of any of the following without Executive s prior written consent:  (A) a material reduction in Executive s Base Salary, (B) a material reduction in Executive s title, duties or level of responsibilities as compared to those existing as of the Effective Date, excluding for this purpose any such reduction that is an isolated and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith, but including any circumstances under which the Company is no longer publicly traded and is controlled by another company, (C) a material and adverse change in reporting structure such that Executive is no longer reporting directly to the Reporting Officer or (D) the relocation of Executive s principal place of employment outside of the Dallas, Texas metropolitan area;   provided   that in no event shall Executive s resignation be for  Good Reason  unless (x) an event or circumstance set forth in clauses (A), (B), (C) or (D)  shall have occurred and Executive provides the Company with written notice thereof within thirty (30) days after Executive has initial knowledge of the occurrence or existence of such event or circumstance, which notice specifically identifies the  
  
   2 

event or circumstance that Executive believes constitutes Good Reason, (y) the Company fails to correct the circumstance or event so identified within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice, and (z) Executive resigns within ninety (90) days after the date of delivery of the notice referred to in clause (x) above. 
  (e)        OFFSET  .  If Executive obtains other employment during the period of time in which the Company is required to make payments to Executive pursuant to Section 1(d)(i) above, the amount of any such remaining payments or benefits to be provided to Executive shall be reduced by the amount of compensation and benefits earned by Executive from such other employment through the end of such period.  For purposes of this Section 1(e), Executive shall have an obligation to inform the Company regarding Executive s employment status following termination and during the period of time in which the Company is making payments to Executive under Section 1(d)(i) above. 
  (f)        ACCRUED OBLIGATIONS  .  As used in this Agreement,  Accrued Obligations  shall mean the sum of (i) any portion of Executive s accrued but unpaid Base Salary through the date of death or termination of employment for any reason, as the case may be; (ii) any compensation previously earned but deferred by Executive (together with any interest or earnings thereon) that has not yet been paid and that is not otherwise to be paid at a later date pursuant to the executive deferred compensation plan of the Company, if any, and (iii) any reimbursements that Executive is entitled to receive under Section 3A(d)(i) of the Agreement.  
  (g)        NON-RENEWAL  .  If the Company delivers a Non-Renewal Notice to Executive then,   provided   Executive s employment hereunder continues through the expiration date then in effect, effective as of such expiration date, Executive s employment with the Company automatically will terminate and the Company and Executive shall have the same rights and obligations hereunder as they would if the Company had terminated Executive s employment hereunder at the end of the Term for any reason other than Executive s death, Disability or for Cause.  
  2.        CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION; NON-COMPETITION; NON-SOLICITATION; AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. 
  (a)        CONFIDENTIALITY  .  Executive acknowledges that, while employed by the Company, Executive will occupy a position of trust and confidence.  The Company, its subsidiaries and/or affiliates shall provide Executive with  Confidential Information  as referred to below.  Executive shall not, except as may be required to perform Executive s duties hereunder or as required by applicable law, without limitation in time, communicate, divulge, disseminate, disclose to others or otherwise use, whether directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information regarding the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries and/or affiliates.   
   Confidential Information  shall mean information about the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, and their respective businesses, employees, consultants, contractors, clients and customers that is not disclosed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates for financial reporting purposes or otherwise generally made available to the public (other than by Executive s breach of the terms hereof) and that was learned or developed by Executive in  
  
   3 

the course of employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, including (without limitation) any proprietary knowledge, trade secrets, data, formulae, information and client and customer lists and all papers, resumes, and records (including computer records) of the documents containing such Confidential Information.  Executive acknowledges that such Confidential Information is specialized, unique in nature and of great value to the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates, and that such information gives the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates a competitive advantage.  Executive agrees to deliver or return to the Company, at the Company s request at any time or upon termination or expiration of Executive s employment or as soon thereafter as possible, all documents, computer tapes and disks, records, lists, data, drawings, prints, notes and written information (and all copies thereof) furnished by the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates or prepared by Executive in the course of Executive s employment by the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates.  As used in this Agreement,  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  shall mean any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with the Company.  As of the date hereof, Expedia, Inc. and its subsidiaries are not  affiliates  of the Company. 
  (b)        NON-COMPETITION  .  In consideration of this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration provided hereunder, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by Executive, Executive hereby agrees and covenants that, during Executive s employment with the Company and for a period of (12) twelve months thereafter, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, engage in or become associated with a Competitive Activity.  For purposes of this Section 2(b), (i) a    Competitive Activity    means any business or other endeavor involving products or services that are the same or similar to products or services that any business of the Company is engaged in providing as of the date hereof or at any time during the Term (the    Company Products or Services   ),   provided   such business or endeavor is in the United States, or in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company provides, or has provided during the Term, the relevant Company Group Products or Services; and (ii) Executive shall be considered to have become    associated with a Competitive Activity    if Executive becomes directly or indirectly involved as an owner, principal, employee, officer, director, independent contractor, representative, stockholder, financial backer, agent, partner, member, advisor, lender, consultant or in any other individual or representative capacity with any individual, partnership, corporation or other organization that is engaged in a Competitive Activity.  
  Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 2(b), Executive may own, for investment purposes only, up to five percent (5%) of the outstanding capital stock of any     publicly-traded corporation engaged in a Competitive Activity if the stock of such corporation is either listed on a national stock exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System if Executive is not otherwise affiliated with such corporation.  Executive acknowledges that Executive s covenants under this Section 2(b) are a material inducement to the Company s entering into this Agreement. 
  (c)        NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES  . Executive recognizes that he will possess Confidential Information about other employees, consultants and contractors of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, compensation and benefits, and inter-personal relationships with suppliers to and  
  
   4 

customers of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Executive recognizes that the information he will possess about these other employees, consultants and contractors is not generally known, is of substantial value to the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in developing their respective businesses and in securing and retaining customers, and will be acquired by Executive because of Executive s business position with the Company. Executive agrees that, during Executive s employment with the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, solicit, recruit or hire any employee of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries and/or affiliates (or any individual who was an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and/or affiliates at any time during the six (6) months prior to such act of hiring, solicitation or recruitment) for the purpose of being employed by Executive or by any business, individual, partnership, firm, corporation or other entity on whose behalf Executive is acting as an agent, representative or employee and that Executive will not convey any such Confidential Information or trade secrets about employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to any other person except within the scope of Executive s duties hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive is not precluded from soliciting or hiring any individual who (i) responds to any public advertisement or general solicitation or (ii) has resigned or been terminated by the Company at least six (6) months prior to the solicitation.  
  (d)        NON-SOLICITATION OF BUSINESS PARTNERS  . During Executive s employment with the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, persuade or encourage any business partners or business affiliates of (i) the Company and/or (ii) any of its subsidiaries and/or affiliates with whom Executive has direct contact during his employment with the Company, in each case, to cease doing business with the Company or any of its subsidiaries and/or affiliates or to engage in any business competitive with the Company and/or its subsidiaries and/or affiliates.  
  (e)        PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; ASSIGNMENT  . All Employee Developments (defined below) shall be considered works made for hire by Executive for the Company or, as applicable, its subsidiaries or affiliates, and Executive agrees that all rights of any kind in any Employee Developments belong exclusively to the Company.  In order to permit the Company to exploit such Employee Developments, Executive shall promptly and fully report all such Employee Developments to the Company.  Except in furtherance of his obligations as an employee of the Company, Executive shall not use or reproduce any portion of any record associated with any Employee Development without prior written consent of the Company or, as applicable, its subsidiaries or affiliates.  Executive agrees that in the event actions of Executive are required to ensure that such rights belong to the Company under applicable laws, Executive will cooperate and take whatever such actions are reasonably requested by the Company, whether during or after the Term, and without the need for separate or additional compensation.     Employee Developments    means any idea, know-how, discovery, invention, design, method, technique, improvement, enhancement, development, computer program, machine, algorithm or other work of authorship, whether developed, conceived or reduced to practice during the period of employment, that: (i) concerns or relates to the actual or anticipated business, research or development activities, or operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, (ii) results from or is suggested by any undertaking assigned to Executive or work performed by Executive for or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether created  
  
   5 

alone or with others, during or after working hours, or (iii) uses, incorporates or is based on Company equipment, supplies, facilities, trade secrets or inventions of any form or type.  All Confidential Information and all Employee Developments are and shall remain the sole property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.  Executive shall acquire no proprietary interest in any Confidential Information or Employee Developments developed or acquired during the Term.  To the extent Executive may, by operation of law or otherwise, acquire any right, title or interest in or to any Confidential Information or Employee Development, Executive hereby assigns and covenants to assign to the Company all such proprietary rights without the need for a separate writing or additional compensation.  Executive shall, both during and after the Term, upon the Company s request, promptly execute, acknowledge, and deliver to the Company all such assignments, confirmations of assignment, certificates, and instruments, and shall promptly perform such other acts, as the Company may from time to time in its discretion deem necessary or desirable to evidence, establish, maintain, perfect, enforce or defend the Company s rights in Confidential Information and Employee Developments. 
  (f)        COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES  . During the period that Executive is employed with the Company hereunder, Executive shall adhere to the policies and standards of professionalism set forth in the Company s Policies and Procedures as they may exist and be made known to the Executive by the Company from time to time. 
  (g)        SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS  . The obligations contained in this Section 2 shall, to the extent provided in this Section 2, survive the termination or expiration of Executive s employment with the Company and, as applicable, shall be fully enforceable thereafter in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that any restriction in this Section 2 is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under applicable law, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. 
  3.        TERMINATION OF PRIOR AGREEMENTS  .  This Agreement, together with any agreements referenced herein, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and, as of the Effective Date, terminates and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.  Executive acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has made, and is not making, and in executing this Agreement, Executive has not relied upon, any representations, promises or inducements except to the extent the same is expressly set forth in this Agreement.   
  4.        ASSIGNMENT; SUCCESSORS  . This Agreement is personal in its nature and none of the parties hereto shall, without the consent of the others, assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder; provided, that the Company may assign this Agreement to, or allow any of its obligations to be fulfilled by, or take actions through, any affiliate of the Company and, in the event of the merger, consolidation, transfer, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (a    Transaction   ) with or to any other individual or entity, this Agreement shall, subject to the provisions hereof, be binding upon and inure to the  
  
   6 

benefit of such successor and such successor shall discharge and perform all the promises, covenants, duties, and obligations of the Company hereunder, and in the event of any such assignment or Transaction, all references herein to the  Company  shall refer to the Company s assignee or successor hereunder.  
  5.        WITHHOLDING  . The Company shall make such deductions and withhold such amounts from each payment and benefit made or provided to Executive hereunder, as may be required from time to time by applicable law, governmental regulation or order. 
  6.        WAIVER; MODIFICATION  . Failure to insist upon strict compliance with any of the terms, covenants, or conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant, or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of, or failure to insist upon strict compliance with, any right or power hereunder at any one or more times be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times. This Agreement shall not be modified in any respect except by a writing executed by each party hereto.  
  7.        SECTION 409A OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE  .   
  (a)        This Agreement is not intended to constitute a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations issued thereunder ( Section 409A ).  It is intended that any amounts payable under this Agreement and the Company s and Executive s exercise of authority or discretion hereunder shall comply with and avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of the Code.  This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with that intent. 
  (b)        For purposes of this Agreement, a  Separation from Service  occurs when Executive dies, retires or otherwise has a termination of employment with the Company that constitutes a  separation from service  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(1), without regard to the optional alternative definitions available thereunder. 
  (c)        If Executive is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i) as of the date of Executive s Separation from Service, Executive shall not be entitled to any payment or benefit pursuant to clause (i) of Section 1(d) until the earlier of (i) the date which is six (6) months after his or her Separation from Service for any reason other than death, or (ii) the date of Executive s death.  The provisions of this paragraph shall only apply if, and to the extent, required to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A.  Any amounts otherwise payable to Executive upon or in the six (6) month period following Executive s Separation from Service that are not so paid by reason of this Section 6(b) shall be paid (without interest) as soon as practicable after the date that is six (6) months after Executive s Separation from Service (or, if earlier, as soon as practicable after the date of Executive s death).  
  (d)        To the extent that any reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement is taxable to Executive, Executive shall provide the Company with documentation of the related expenses promptly so as to facilitate the timing of the reimbursement payment contemplated by this  
  
   7 

paragraph, and any reimbursement payment due to Executive pursuant to such provision shall be paid to Executive on or before the last day of Executive s taxable year following the taxable year in which the related expense was incurred.  Such reimbursement obligations pursuant to this Agreement are not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit and the amount of such benefits that Executive receives in one taxable year shall not affect the amount of such benefits that Executive receives in any other taxable year. 
  (e)        In no event shall the Company be required to pay Executive any  gross-up  or other payment with respect to any taxes or penalties imposed under Section 409A with respect to any benefit paid to Executive hereunder.  The Company agrees to take any reasonable steps requested by Executive to avoid adverse tax consequences to Executive as a result of any benefit to Executive hereunder being subject to Section 409A, provided that Executive shall, if requested, reimburse the Company for any incremental costs (other than incidental costs) associated with taking such steps.  All payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a  separation from service  under Section 409A.  
  8.        HEADING REFERENCES  . Section headings in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose. References to  this Agreement  or the use of the term  hereof  shall refer to these Standard Terms and Conditions and the Employment Agreement attached hereto, taken as a whole. 
  9.        REMEDIES FOR BREACH  .  
  (a)        Executive expressly agrees and understands that Executive will notify the Company in writing of any alleged breach of this Agreement by the Company, and the Company will have thirty (30) days from receipt of Executive s notice to cure any such breach. Executive expressly agrees and understands that in the event of any termination of Executive s employment by the Company during the Term, the Company s contractual obligations to Executive shall be fulfilled through compliance with its obligations under Section 1 of the Standard Terms and Conditions.  
  (b)        Executive expressly agrees and understands that the remedy at law for any breach by Executive of Section 2 of the Standard Terms and Conditions will be inadequate and that damages flowing from such breach are not usually susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that, upon Executive s violation of any provision of such Section 2, the Company shall be entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction immediate injunctive relief and obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach as well as an equitable accounting of all profits or benefits arising out of such violation. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit the Company s remedies at law or in equity for any breach by Executive of any of the provisions of this Agreement, including Section 2, which may be pursued by or available to the Company. 
  10.        SEVERABILITY  . In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Agreement is in violation of any law or public policy, only the portions of this Agreement that violate such law or public policy shall be stricken. All portions of this  
  
   8 

Agreement that do not violate any law or public policy shall continue in full force and effect. Further, any court order striking any portion of this Agreement shall modify the stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to the intentions of the parties under this Agreement. 
  11.       INDEMNIFICATION  .   The Company shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless for acts and omissions in Executive s capacity as an officer, director or employee of the Company to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law;   provided  ,   however  , that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries and affiliates shall indemnify Executive for any losses incurred by Executive as a result of acts described in Section 1(c) of the Standard Terms and Conditions of this Agreement.
