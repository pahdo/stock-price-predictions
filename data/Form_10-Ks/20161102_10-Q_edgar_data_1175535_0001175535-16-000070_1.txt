  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  September 30, 2016 
  (Unaudited) 

The use of the words  we,   us,   our,   Company  or  Whitestone  refers to   Whitestone REIT   and our consolidated subsidiaries, except where the context otherwise requires. 

1.  INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
    
  The consolidated financial statements included in this report are unaudited; however, amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.  The unaudited financial statements as of and for the period ended   September 30, 2016   have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information on a basis consistent with the annual audited consolidated financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. 
    
  The consolidated financial statements presented herein reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of   Whitestone   and our subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016  , and the results of operations for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the consolidated statements of changes in equity for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   and cash flows for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  All of these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for a full year.  The statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Business  .    Whitestone   was formed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) pursuant to the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act on August 20, 1998.  In July 2004, we changed our state of organization from Texas to Maryland pursuant to a merger where we merged directly with and into a Maryland REIT formed for the sole purpose of the reorganization and the conversion of each of the outstanding common shares of beneficial interest of the Texas entity into   1.42857   common shares of beneficial interest of the Maryland entity.  We serve as the general partner of Whitestone REIT Operating Partnership, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ), which was formed on December 31, 1998 as a Delaware limited partnership.  We currently conduct substantially all of our operations and activities through the Operating Partnership.  As the general partner of the Operating Partnership, we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Partnership, subject to certain customary exceptions.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Whitestone owned and operated   71   and   70   commercial properties, respectively, in and around Austin, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Phoenix and San Antonio. 

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Basis of Consolidation.    We are the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and possess full legal control and authority over the operations of the Operating Partnership.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we owned a majority of the partnership interests in the Operating Partnership.  Consequently, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Operating Partnership.  All significant inter-company balances have been eliminated.  Noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements represents the share of equity and earnings of the Operating Partnership allocable to holders of partnership interests other than us.  Net income or loss is allocated to noncontrolling interests based on the weighted average percentage ownership of the Operating Partnership during the period.  Issuance of additional common shares of beneficial interest in   Whitestone   (the  common shares ) and units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership that are convertible into cash or, at our option, common shares on a   one  -for-one basis (the  OP units ) changes the ownership interests of both the noncontrolling interests and   Whitestone  . 
     
  Basis of Accounting.    Our financial records are maintained on the accrual basis of accounting whereby revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred. 
    
  Use of Estimates.     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Significant estimates that we use include the estimated fair values of properties acquired, the estimated useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets and costs, the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts, the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps and the estimates supporting our impairment analysis for the carrying values of our real estate assets.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Reclassifications.    We have reclassified certain prior period amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in order to be consistent with the current period presentation.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we reclassified certain deferred financing costs, previously classified as an asset as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of certain debt liabilities for all periods presented.  Deferred financing costs related to our unsecured line of credit have not been reclassified.  See Note 6 for additional information.  These reclassifications had no effect on net income or equity.   
    
    Restricted Cash.    We classify all cash pledged as collateral to secure certain obligations and all cash whose use is limited as restricted cash.  During 2015, pursuant to the terms of our   $15.1 million     4.99%   Note, due January 6, 2024 (See Note 6), which is collateralized by our Anthem Marketplace property, we were required by the lenders thereunder to establish a cash management account controlled by the lenders to collect all amounts generated by our Anthem Marketplace property in order to collateralize such promissory note.  As a result, these amounts are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows under cash flows from financing activities as change in restricted cash. 
    
  Marketable Securities.    We classify our existing marketable equity securities as available-for-sale in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ( FASB ) Investments-Debt and Equity Securities guidance. These securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.  The fair value of the marketable securities is determined using Level 1 inputs under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820,    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.    Level 1 inputs represent quoted prices available in an active market for identical investments as of the reporting date.  Gains and losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method, and are reported as a component of interest, dividend and other investment income.  
    
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.    We utilize derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.  We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment, and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instruments.  We recognize our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges with the effective portion of the changes in fair value recorded in comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.  Any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedges' change in fair value is recorded immediately into earnings.  Our cash flow hedges are determined using Level 2 inputs under ASC 820.  Level 2 inputs represent quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we consider our cash flow hedges to be highly effective. 
           
    Development Properties.    Land, buildings and improvements are recorded at cost.  Expenditures related to the development of real estate are carried at cost which includes capitalized carrying charges and development costs.  Carrying charges (interest, real estate taxes, loan fees, and direct and indirect development costs related to buildings under construction), are capitalized as part of construction in progress.  The capitalization of such costs ceases when the property, or any completed portion, becomes available for occupancy.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $103,000   and   $16,000   in interest expense and real estate taxes, respectively, were capitalized, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $235,000   and   $48,000   in interest expense and real estate taxes, respectively, were capitalized.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , approximately   $25,000   and   $16,000   in interest expense and real estate taxes, respectively, were capitalized, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , approximately   $83,000   and   $53,000   in interest expense and real estate taxes, respectively, were capitalized.  
    
  Real Estate Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.   We consider a commercial property to be held for sale when it meets all of the criteria established under ASC 205,    Presentation of Financial Statements.    For commercial properties classified as held for sale, assets and liabilities are presented separately for all periods presented. 
    
  In accordance with ASC 205,     a discontinued operation may include a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity.  A disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when the component of an entity or group of components of an entity is classified as held for sale, disposed of by sale or disposed of other than by sale, respectively.  In addition, ASC 205 requires us to provide additional disclosures about both discontinued operations and the disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not meet the criteria for a discontinued operation.

Share-Based Compensation.     From time to time, we award nonvested restricted common share awards or restricted common share unit awards, which may be converted into common shares, to executive officers and employees under our 2008 Long-Term Equity Incentive Ownership Plan (the  2008 Plan ).  The vast majority of the awarded shares and units vest when certain performance conditions are met.  We recognize compensation expense when achievement of the performance conditions is probable based on management's most recent estimates using the fair value of the shares as of the grant date.  We recognized   $3,042,000   and   $1,859,000   in share-based compensation for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and we recognized   $6,886,000   and   $5,202,000   in share-based compensation for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Noncontrolling Interests.    Noncontrolling interests is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable to a parent.  The ownership interests not held by the parent are considered noncontrolling interests.  Accordingly, we have reported noncontrolling interests in equity on the consolidated balance sheets but separate from Whitestone's equity.  On the consolidated statements of operations, subsidiaries are reported at the consolidated amount, including both the amount attributable to Whitestone and noncontrolling interests.  The consolidated statement of changes in equity is included for quarterly financial statements, including beginning balances, activity for the period and ending balances for shareholders' equity, noncontrolling interests and total equity. 
    
  See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for further discussion on significant accounting policies. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  .  In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance to clarify that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit agreements may still be presented as an asset and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of such arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit.  This guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015 and is to be applied retrospectively.  We have adopted this guidance for all periods presented. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance requiring lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases.  Lessor accounting will remain largely unchanged.  The guidance will also require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the timing, amount and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  This guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance and its impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance simplifying the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, balance sheet classification of awards and the classification on the statement of cash flows.  This guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance and its impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

3.  MARKETABLE SECURITIES  
    
  All of our marketable securities were classified as available-for-sale securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Available-for-sale securities consisted of the following (in thousands):

Debt consisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands): 

(1)   
    Promissory note includes an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate at   3.55%   for the duration of the term. 

(3)   
    Promissory note includes an interest rate swap that fixed the LIBOR portion of Term Loan 2 (as defined below) at   1.50%  . 
       
            (4)   
    Promissory note includes an interest rate swap that fixed the LIBOR portion of Term Loan 3 (as defined below) at   1.73%  , 
       
            (5)   
    Promissory note includes an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate at   5.72%   for the duration of the term.  As part of our acquisition of Paradise Plaza in August 2012, we recorded a discount on the note of   $1.3 million  , which amortizes into interest expense over the life of the loan and results in an imputed interest rate of   4.13%  . 
       
  On November 7, 2014, we, through our Operating Partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the  2014 Facility ) with the lenders party thereto, with BMO Capital Markets, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated, and U.S. Bank, National Association, as co-lead arrangers and joint book runners, and Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent (the  Agent ). The 2014 Facility amended and restated our previous unsecured revolving credit facility.   On October 30, 2015, we, through our Operating Partnership, entered into the First Amendment to the 2014 Facility (the  First Amendment ) with the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and the Agent.  We refer to the 2014 Facility, as amended by the First Amendment, as the  Facility.

  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  September 30, 2016 
  (Unaudited) 

Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company made the following amendments to the 2014 Facility: 

Borrowings under the Facility accrue interest (at the Operating Partnership's option) at a Base Rate or an Adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon our then existing leverage.  The applicable margin for Adjusted LIBOR borrowings ranges from   1.40%   to   1.95%   for the Revolver and   1.35%   to   2.25%   for the Term Loans.  Base Rate means the higher of: (a) the Agent's prime commercial rate, (b) the sum of (i) the average rate quoted by the Agent by two or more federal funds brokers selected by the Agent for sale to the Agent at face value of federal funds in the secondary market in an amount equal or comparable to the principal amount for which such rate is being determined, plus (ii) 1/2 of   1.00%  , and (c) the LIBOR rate for such day plus   1.00%  . Adjusted LIBOR means LIBOR divided by one minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage.

7.  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
    
  The fair value of our interest rate swaps is as follows (in thousands): 

On November 19, 2015, we, through our Operating Partnership, entered into an interest rate swap with Bank of Montreal that fixed the LIBOR portion of Term Loan 3 under the Facility at   1.725%  .  In the fourth quarter of 2015, pursuant to the terms of the agreement governing the interest rate swap, Bank of Montreal assigned   $35.0 million   of the swap to U.S. Bank, National Association, and   $15.0 million   of the swap to SunTrust Bank.

We have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge with the effective portion of the changes in fair value to be recorded in comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value, if any, will be recognized directly in earnings.   
    
  On November 19, 2015, we, through our Operating Partnership, entered into an interest rate swap with Bank of Montreal that fixed the LIBOR portion of Term Loan 1 under the Facility at   1.75%  .

A summary of our interest rate swap activity is as follows (in thousands): 

(1)   
    We did not recognize any ineffective portion of our interest rate swaps in earnings for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

8.  EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  Basic earnings per share for our common shareholders is calculated by dividing income from continuing operations excluding amounts attributable to unvested restricted common shares and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests by our weighted average common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common shareholders excluding amounts attributable to unvested restricted common shares and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests by the weighted average number of common shares including any dilutive unvested restricted common shares. 
    
  Certain of our performance-based restricted common shares are considered participating securities that require the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   487,090   and   435,440   OP units, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive, and during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   487,510   and   406,277   OP units, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , distributions of   $158,000   and   $139,000  , respectively, were made to holders of certain restricted common shares,   $12,000   and   $9,000  , respectively, of which were charged against earnings.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , distributions of   $510,000   and   $427,000  , respectively, were made to holders of certain restricted common shares,   $12,000   and   $27,000  , respectively, of which were charged against earnings.  See Note 11 for information related to restricted common shares under the 2008 Plan.

9.  INCOME TAXES  
    
  With the exception of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, federal income taxes are generally not provided because we intend to and believe we qualify as a REIT under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ) and because we have distributed and intend to continue to distribute all of our taxable income to our shareholders.  As a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain income sources and investment restriction requirements.  In addition, REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.

Income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiary, Whitestone Davenport TRS LLC ( Davenport TRS ), is subject to federal income tax.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $45,000   in income tax expense related to Davenport TRS for the 2016 taxable year. 
    
  Taxable income differs from net income for financial reporting purposes principally due to differences in the timing of recognition of interest, real estate taxes, depreciation and rental revenue.  We recorded   $49,000   in credits to tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 for the 2015 taxable year. 
    
  We are subject to the Texas Margin Tax, which is computed by applying the applicable tax rate (  0.75%   for us) to the profit margin, which generally will be determined for us as total revenue less a   30%   standard deduction.  Although the Texas Margin Tax is not an income tax, FASB ASC 740,    Income Taxes    applies to the Texas Margin Tax.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized approximately   $75,000   and   $104,000   in margin tax provision, respectively, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized approximately   $237,000   and   $292,000   in margin tax provision, respectively. 

10.  EQUITY 
    
    Common Shares       
    
  Under our declaration of trust, as amended, we have authority to issue up to   400,000,000   common shares of beneficial interest,   $0.001   par value per share, and up to   50,000,000   preferred shares of beneficial interest,   $0.001   par value per share. 
     
    Equity Offerings 
    
  On June 26, 2015, we completed the sale of   3,750,000   common shares,   $0.001   par value per share, at a purchase price of   $13.3386   per share.  Total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting offering expenses, were approximately   $49.7 million  , which we contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP units.  The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of the Facility and for general corporate purposes.  
    
  On June 4, 2015, we entered into   six   amended and restated equity distribution agreements for an at-the-market equity distribution program (the  2015 equity distribution agreements ).  Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2015 equity distribution agreements, we can issue and sell up to an aggregate of   $50 million   of our common shares.  Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of our common shares, capital needs and our determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for us, and will be made in transactions that will be deemed to be  at-the-market  offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. We have no obligation to sell any of our common shares, and can at any time suspend offers under the 2015 equity distribution agreements or terminate the 2015 equity distribution agreements.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   1,083,926   common shares under the 2015 equity distribution agreements, with net proceeds to us of approximately   $16.1 million  .  In connection with such sales, we paid compensation of approximately   $0.2 million   to the sales agents.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   1,819,681   common shares under the 2015 equity distribution agreements, with net proceeds to us of approximately   $26.7 million  .  In connection with such sales, we paid compensation of approximately   $0.4 million   to the sales agents.  We had not sold any common shares under the 2015 equity distribution agreements as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
    Operating Partnership Units    
    
  Substantially all of our business is conducted through our Operating Partnership.  We are the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a   96.3%   interest in the Operating Partnership.

Limited partners in the Operating Partnership holding OP units have the right to redeem their OP units for cash or, at our option, common shares at a ratio of   one   OP unit for   one   common share.  Distributions to OP unit holders are paid at the same rate per unit as distributions per share to holders of Whitestone common shares.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   30,200,345   and   27,367,704   OP units outstanding, respectively.  We owned   29,097,709   and   26,870,671   OP units as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The balance of the OP units is owned by third parties, including certain members of our board of trustees.  Our weighted average share ownership in the Operating Partnership was approximately   98.3%   and   98.4%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   98.3%   and   98.4%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   2,434   and   1,693   OP units, respectively, were redeemed for an equal number of c  ommon shares, and during the     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   15,450   and   10,277   OP units, respectively, were redeemed for an equal number of common shares. 
    
     Distributions 
    
  The following table summarizes the cash distributions paid or payable to holders of common shares and to holders of noncontrolling OP units during each quarter during   2015   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (in thousands, except per share/unit data): 

11.  INCENTIVE SHARE PLAN 
    
  On July 29, 2008, our shareholders approved the 2008 Plan.  On December 22, 2010, our board of trustees amended the 2008 Plan to allow for awards in or related to Class B common shares pursuant to the 2008 Plan.  On June 27, 2012, our Class B common shares were redesignated as  common shares.   The 2008 Plan, as amended, provides that awards may be made with respect to common shares of Whitestone or OP units, which may be redeemed for cash or, at our option, common shares of Whitestone.  The maximum aggregate number of common shares that may be issued under the 2008 Plan is increased upon each issuance of common shares by Whitestone so that at any time the maximum number of common shares that may be issued under the 2008 Plan shall equal   12.5%   of the aggregate number of common shares of Whitestone and OP units issued and outstanding (other than common shares and/or OP units issued to or held by Whitestone). 
    
  The Compensation Committee of our board of trustees administers the 2008 Plan, except with respect to awards to non-employee trustees, for which the 2008 Plan is administered by our board of trustees.  The Compensation Committee is authorized to grant share options, including both incentive share options and non-qualified share options, as well as share appreciation rights, either with or without a related option.  The Compensation Committee is also authorized to grant restricted common shares, restricted common share units, performance awards and other share-based awards.

On April 2, 2014, the Compensation Committee approved the modification of the vesting provisions with respect to awards of an aggregate of   633,704   restricted common shares and restricted common share units for   51   of our employees.  The modified time-based shares will vest annually in three equal installments.  The modified performance-based restricted common shares and restricted common share units were modified to include performance-based vesting based on achievement of certain absolute financial goals, as well as   one   to   two years   of time-based vesting post achievement of financial goals.  Continued employment is required through the applicable vesting date.  Additionally,   2,049,116   restricted performance-based common share units were granted with the same vesting conditions as the modified performance-based grants described above.  If the performance targets are not met prior to December 31, 2018, any unvested performance-based restricted common shares and restricted common share units will be forfeited.  
    
  The Compensation Committee approved the grant of an aggregate of   320,000   and   143,000   time-based restricted common share units on June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to James C. Mastandrea and David K. Holeman. 
    
  A summary of the share-based incentive plan activity as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

A summary of our non-vested and vested shares activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is presented below: 

Total compensation recognized in earnings for share-based payments was   $3,042,000   and   $1,859,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $6,886,000   and   $5,202,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Based on our current financial projections, we expect approximately   83%     of the unvested awards to vest over the next     30     months.  As of     September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $6.8 million   in unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding non-vested performance-based shares, which are expected to vest over a period of   30   months and approximately   $6.4 million   in unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding non-vested time-based shares, which are expected to be recognized over a period of approximately   15   months beginning on October 1, 2016.

We expect to record approximately   $9.8 million     in non-cash share-based compensation expense in 2016 and     $10.3 million     subsequent to 2016.  The unrecognized share-based compensation cost is expected to vest over a weighted average period of     20     months.      The dilutive impact of the performance-based shares will be included in the denominator of the earnings per share calculation beginning in the period that the performance conditions are expected to be met.   

12.  GRANTS TO TRUSTEES  
    
  On December 21, 2015, each of our   four   independent trustees and   one   trustee emeritus was granted   1,500   common shares, which vested immediately.  The   7,500   common shares granted to our trustees had a grant fair value of   $12.10   per share.  On December 21, 2015,   one   of our independent trustees elected to receive a total of   992   common shares with a grant date fair value of   $12.10   in lieu of cash for board fees.  The fair value of the shares granted were determined using quoted prices available on the date of grant.

  Overview 
    
  We are a self-managed, fully-integrated real estate company that primarily owns, manages, and redevelops high quality retail properties, which we refer to as Community Centered Properties .  Our properties are located in attractive and affluent neighborhoods within high growth markets located primarily in the Sunbelt, such as Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Phoenix and San Antonio.  We believe that gaining critical mass within these target markets, combined with our local market intelligence, existing platform, access to capital and broad network of industry relationships, gives us a competitive advantage and allows us to generate long-term return opportunities and added value for our shareholders.

In October 2006, our current management team joined the Company and adopted a strategic plan to acquire, redevelop, own and operate Community Centered Properties   TM   .  We market, lease and manage our centers to match tenants with the shared needs of the surrounding neighborhood.  Those needs may include specialty retail, grocery, restaurants, medical, educational and financial services, and entertainment.  Our goal is for each property to become a Whitestone-branded business center or retail community that serves a neighboring five-mile radius around our property.  We employ and develop a diverse group of associates who understand the needs of our multicultural communities and tenants. 
    
  We serve as the general partner of Whitestone REIT Operating Partnership, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ), which was formed on December 31, 1998 as a Delaware limited partnership.  We currently conduct substantially all of our operations and activities through the Operating Partnership.  As the general partner of the Operating Partnership, we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Partnership, subject to certain customary exceptions. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned and operated   71   commercial properties consisting of: 
    
  Operating Portfolio 
             
    48   retail properties containing approximately   4.2 million   square feet of gross leasable area and having a total carrying value (net of accumulated depreciation) of   $645.8 million  ; 
                
    four   office properties containing approximately   0.5 million   square feet of gross leasable area and having a total carrying value (net of accumulated depreciation) of   $35.9 million  ; and 
                
    10   office/flex properties containing approximately   1.1 million   square feet of gross leasable area and having a total carrying value (net of accumulated depreciation) of   $35.1 million  . 
     Redevelopment, New Acquisitions Portfolio 
             
    three   retail properties containing approximately   0.2 million   square feet of gross leasable area and having a total carrying value (net of accumulated depreciation) of   $78.6 million  ; and 
                
    six   parcels of land held for future development having a total carrying value of   $19.4 million  . 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an aggregate of   1,561   tenants.  We have a diversified tenant base with our largest tenant comprising only   3.0%   of our annualized rental revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Lease terms for our properties range from less than one year for smaller tenants to over 15 years for larger tenants.  Our leases generally include minimum monthly lease payments and tenant reimbursements for payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance.  We completed   336   new and renewal leases during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , totaling   863,936   square feet and approximately   $57.1 million   in total lease value.  This compares to   304   new and renewal leases totaling   707,993   square feet and approximately   $42.8 million   in total lease value during the same period in   2015  . 
    
  We employed   101   full-time employees as of   September 30, 2016  .  As an internally managed REIT, we bear our own expenses of operations, including the salaries, benefits and other compensation of our employees, office expenses, legal, accounting and investor relations expenses and other overhead costs. 
    
  How We Derive Our Revenue 
    
  Substantially all of our revenue is derived from rents received from leases at our properties.  We had rental income and tenant reimbursements of approximately   $25.5 million   and   $24.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $76.1 million   and   $67.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Known Trends in Our Operations; Outlook for Future Results 
    
  Rental Income 
    
  We expect our rental income to increase year-over-year due to the addition of properties and rent increases on renewal leases. The amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space, newly acquired properties with vacant space, and space available from unscheduled lease terminations. The amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in our submarkets. Over the past two years, we have seen modest improvement in the overall economy in our markets, which has allowed us to maintain overall occupancy rates, with slight increases in occupancy at certain of our properties, and to recognize modest increases in rental rates.  We expect this trend to continue in 2016. 
    
  Scheduled Lease Expirations 
    
  We tend to lease space to smaller businesses that desire shorter term leases.  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   21%   of our gross leasable area was subject to leases that expire prior to December 31, 2017.  Over the last two years, we have renewed leases covering approximately   76%   of the square footage subject to expiring leases.  We routinely seek to renew leases with our existing tenants prior to their expiration and typically begin discussions with tenants as early as 18 months prior to the expiration date of the existing lease.  While our early renewal program and other leasing and marketing efforts target these expiring leases, we hope to re-lease most of that space prior to expiration of the leases.  In the markets in which we operate, we obtain and analyze market rental rates through review of third-party publications, which provide market and submarket rental rate data and through inquiry of property owners and property management companies as to rental rates being quoted at properties that are located in close proximity to our properties and we believe display similar physical attributes as our nearby properties.  We use this data to negotiate leases with new tenants and renew leases with our existing tenants at rates we believe to be competitive in the markets for our individual properties.  Due to the short term nature of our leases, and based upon our analysis of market rental rates, we believe that, in the aggregate, our current leases are at market rates.  Market conditions, including new supply of properties, and macroeconomic conditions in our markets and nationally affecting tenant income, such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and energy costs and other matters, could adversely impact our renewal rate and/or the rental rates we are able to negotiate.  We continue to monitor our tenants' operating performances as well as overall economic trends to evaluate any future negative impact on our renewal rates and rental rates, which could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our shareholders. 
    
    Capital Recycling and Becoming a Pure-Play Retail REIT 
    
  We seek to continually upgrade our portfolio by opportunistically selling properties that do not have the potential to meet our Community Centered Property  strategy.  We previously announced our intention to recycle our non-core office and office/flex properties as we transition to becoming a pure-play owner of neighborhood retail centers.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our non-core assets had an aggregate carrying value (net of accumulated depreciation) of approximately   $71.0 million  .  
    
  Acquisitions 
    
  We have continued to successfully grow our gross leasable area through the acquisition of additional properties, and we expect to actively pursue and consummate additional acquisitions in the foreseeable future.  We believe that over the next few years we will continue to have excellent opportunities to acquire quality properties at historically attractive prices.  We have extensive relationships with community banks, attorneys, title companies and others in the real estate industry, which we believe enables us to take advantage of these market opportunities and maintain an active acquisition pipeline.  
    
  Property Acquisitions 
    
  We seek to acquire commercial properties in high-growth markets.  Our acquisition targets are properties that fit our Community Centered Properties   TM    strategy.  We define Community Centered Properties   TM    as visibly located properties in established or developing, culturally diverse neighborhoods in our target markets, primarily in and around Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Phoenix and San Antonio.  We may acquire properties in other high-growth cities in the future.  We market, lease and manage our centers to match tenants with the shared needs of the surrounding neighborhood.  Those needs may include specialty retail, grocery, restaurants, medical, educational and financial services and entertainment.  Our goal is for each property to become a Whitestone-branded business center or retail community that serves a neighboring five-mile radius around our property.

Property revenues.   We had rental income and tenant reimbursements of approximately   $25,508,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $24,599,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $909,000  , or   4%  .  The three months ended   September 30, 2016   included   $489,000   in increased revenues from Non-Same Store operations.  We define  Non-Same Stores  as properties that were not owned for the entire period being compared.  For purposes of comparing the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , Non-Same Stores include properties that were not owned for the entire period between July 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016.  Same Store revenues increased   $420,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year.  We define  Same Stores  as properties that have been owned for the entire period being compared.  For purposes of comparing the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , Same Stores include properties owned during the entire period from July 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  Same Store revenue increased   $179,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   as the result of an increase in the average occupancy to   87.0%   from   86.1%  .  The Same Store average revenue per leased square foot increased   $0.20   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $19.32   per leased square foot as compared to the average revenue per leased square foot of   $19.12   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , resulting in an increase of Same Store revenues of   $241,000  . 
    
  Property expenses.    Our property expenses were approximately   $8,318,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $8,297,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $21,000  , or   0%  .  The primary components of total property expenses are detailed in the table below (in thousands, except percentages):

Real estate taxes.    Real estate taxes decreased approximately   $60,000  , or   2%  , during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Real estate taxes for Non-Same Store properties increased approximately   $46,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Same Store real estate taxes decreased approximately   $106,000   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The decrease in Same Store real estate tax expense was primarily attributable to favorable settlements with tax authorities resulting in a larger expense reduction for refunds during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  We actively work to keep our valuations and resulting taxes low because a majority of these taxes are charged to our tenants through triple net leases, and we strive to keep these charges to our tenants as low as possible. 
    
    Utilities.    Utilities expenses increased approximately   $16,000  , or   1%  , during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .

Same Store contract service expenses increased approximately   $137,000  , or   11%  , during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The Same Store contract service expense increase of $137,000 was primarily attributable to increased security and security monitoring on several of our properties.  
     
  Repairs and maintenance.    Repairs and maintenance expenses decreased approximately   $44,000  , or   6%  , during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Repairs and maintenance expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   included approximately   $7,000   in decreases for Non-Same Store properties.  Same Store repairs and maintenance expenses decreased approximately   $37,000  , or   5%  , during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .

Labor and other expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   included approximately   $35,000   in decreased cost for Non-Same Store properties.  Same Store labor and other expenses decreased approximately   $24,000  , or   3%  , during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .

The increase was comprised of   $1,183,000   in increased   share-based compensation   expense,   $270,000   in increased   salaries and benefits  , and offset by   $391,000   in decreased   acquisition transaction expenses  ,   $521,000   in decreased   legal fees   and   $10,000   in decreased   other expenses  . 
    
  Total compensation recognized in earnings for share-based payments was   $3,042,000   and   $1,859,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Based on our current financial projections, we expect approximately   83%     of the unvested awards to vest over the next     30     months.  As of     September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $6.8 million   in unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding non-vested performance-based shares, which are expected to vest over a period of   30   months and approximately   $6.4 million   in unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding non-vested time-based shares, which are expected to be recognized over a period of approximately   15   months beginning on October 1, 2016.  
    
  We expect to record approximately   $9.8 million     in non-cash share-based compensation expense in 2016 and     $10.3 million     subsequent to 2016.  The unrecognized share-based compensation cost is expected to vest over a weighted average period of     20     months.      The dilutive impact of the performance-based shares will be included in the denominator of the earnings per share calculation beginning in the period that the performance conditions are expected to be met.   
    
     Depreciation and amortization.   Depreciation and amortization increased   $300,000  , or   6%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .    Depreciation for improvements to Same Store properties   increased   $91,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .    Lease commission amortization and depreciation of corporate assets   increased   $55,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .    Depreciation for Non-Same Store properties   increased   $154,000  .   
    
  Interest expense.    Interest expense increased approximately   $929,000  , or   25%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase in interest expense is comprised of approximately $579,000 in increased interest expense resulting from a $75,835,000 increase in our average notes payable balance, $337,000 in increased interest expense resulting from an increase in the average effective interest rate on our average notes payable from 3.05% to 3.31% and an increase in amortized loan fees included in interest expense of $13,000. 
    
  Interest, dividend and other investment income.   Interest, dividend and other investment income increased approximately   $91,000  , or   125%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase in interest, dividend and other investment income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 is comprised of approximately $92,000 in increased interest income and was offset by a $1,000 decrease in dividend income.

Property revenues.   We had rental income and tenant reimbursements of approximately   $76,072,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $67,821,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $8,251,000  , or   12%  .  The   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included   $6,697,000   in increased revenues from Non-Same Store operations.  We define  Non-Same Stores  as properties that were not owned for the entire period being compared.  For purposes of comparing the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , Non-Same Stores include properties that were not owned during the entire period from January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  Same Store revenues increased   $1,554,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year.  We define  Same Stores  as properties that have been owned for the entire period being compared.  For purposes of comparing the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , Same Stores include properties that were owned for the entire period from January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  Same Store revenue increased   $425,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   as the result of an increase in the average occupancy to   87.1%   from   86.3%  .  The Same Store average revenue per leased square foot increased   $0.32   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $18.61   per leased square foot as compared to the average revenue per leased square foot of   $18.29   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , resulting in an increase of Same Store revenues of   $1,129,000  . 
    
  Property expenses.    Our property expenses were approximately   $24,453,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $22,548,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $1,905,000  , or   8%  .  The primary components of total property expenses are detailed in the table below (in thousands, except percentages):

Real estate taxes.    Real estate taxes increased approximately   $769,000  , or   8%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Real estate taxes for Non-Same Store properties increased approximately   $1,157,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Same Store real estate taxes decreased approximately   $388,000   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The decrease in Same Store real estate tax expense was primarily attributable to favorable settlements with tax authorities resulting in a larger expense reduction for refunds  and lower valuations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  We actively work to keep our valuations and resulting taxes low because a majority of these taxes are charged to our tenants through triple net leases, and we strive to keep these charges to our tenants as low as possible. 
    
    Utilities.    Utilities expenses increased approximately   $72,000  , or   2%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Utilities expense increases attributable to Non-Same Store properties were approximately   $182,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Same Store utilities expenses decreased approximately   $110,000  , or   3%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  
    
  Contract services.    Contract services expenses increased approximately   $660,000  , or   17%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase in contract service expenses included   $284,000   in increases for Non-Same Store properties for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Same Store contract service expenses increased approximately   $376,000  , or   10%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The Same Store contract service expense increase of   $376,000   was primarily attributable to increased security and security monitoring on several of our properties.  
     
  Repairs and maintenance.    Repairs and maintenance expenses increased approximately   $347,000  , or   17%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Repairs and maintenance expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included approximately   $51,000   in increases for Non-Same Store properties.  Same Store repairs and maintenance expenses increased approximately   $296,000  , or   15%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The Same Store increase in repairs and maintenance was primarily attributable to routine parking lot surface and life safety system repairs. 
    
  Bad debt.    Bad debt expenses decreased approximately   $44,000  , or   3%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Bad debt expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included approximately   $249,000   in increases for Non-Same Store properties.  Same Store bad debt decreased approximately   $293,000  , or   24%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  
    
  Labor and other.    Labor and other expenses increased approximately   $101,000  , or   4%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Labor and other expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included approximately   $154,000   in increased cost for Non-Same Store properties.  Same Store labor and other expenses decreased approximately   $53,000  , or   2%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .

Other expenses.    Our other expenses were approximately   $46,711,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $39,978,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $6,733,000  , or   17%  .  The primary components of other expenses are detailed in the table below (in thousands, except percentages): 

General and administrative.   General and administrative expenses increased approximately   $1,297,000  , or   9%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase was comprised of   $1,684,000   in increased   share-based compensation   expense,   $707,000   in increased   salaries and benefits   and was offset by   $202,000   in decreased   legal fees  ,   $801,000   in decreased   acquisition transaction expenses   and   $91,000   in decreased other expenses. 
    
  Total compensation recognized in earnings for share-based payments was   $6,886,000   and   $5,202,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Based on our current financial projections, we expect approximately   83%     of the unvested awards to vest over the next     30     months.  As of     September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $6.8 million   in unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding non-vested performance-based shares, which are expected to vest over a period of   30   months and approximately   $6.4 million   in unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding non-vested time-based shares, which are expected to be recognized over a period of approximately   15   months beginning on October 1, 2016.  
    
  We expect to record approximately   $9.8 million     in non-cash share-based compensation expense in 2016 and     $10.3 million     subsequent to 2016.  The unrecognized share-based compensation cost is expected to vest over a weighted average period of     20     months.      The dilutive impact of the performance-based shares will be included in the denominator of the earnings per share calculation beginning in the period that the performance conditions are expected to be met.   
    
     Depreciation and amortization.   Depreciation and amortization increased   $1,974,000  , or   14%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .    Depreciation for improvements to Same Store properties   increased   $247,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .    Lease commission amortization and depreciation of corporate assets   increased   $225,000   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .    Depreciation for Non-Same Store properties   increased   $1,502,000  .   
    
  Interest expense.    Interest expense increased approximately   $3,557,000  , or   33%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase in interest expense is comprised of approximately $2,073,000 in increased interest expense resulting from a $90,213,000 increase in our average notes payable balance, $1,442,000 in increased interest expense resulting from an increase in the average effective interest rate on our average notes payable from 3.06% to 3.44% and an increase in amortized loan fees included in interest expense of $42,000. 
    
  Interest, dividend and other investment income.   Interest, dividend and other investment income increased approximately   $95,000  , or   39%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase in interest, dividend and other investment income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 was comprised of approximately $141,000 in increased interest income and was offset by a decrease of $44,000 in gains realized from the sale of available-for-sale securities and a $2,000 decrease in dividend income.

Property Dispositions.    On March 3, 2016, we completed the sale of Brookhill, located in Houston, Texas, for   $3.1 million  .  This disposition was pursuant to our strategy of recycling capital by disposing of non-core properties, primarily properties that we owned at the time our current management team assumed the management of the Company, that do not fit our Community Centered Property  strategy.  We recorded a gain on sale of   $1.9 million  .  The sale was structured as a like-kind exchange within the meaning of Section 1031 of the Code and sales proceeds were deposited into a Section 1031 exchange escrow account with a qualified intermediary and may be used as consideration for future acquisitions.  We have not included Brookhill in discontinued operations as it did not meet the definition of discontinued operations. 
    
  On February 17, 2016, we completed the sale of approximately   0.5   acres of our   4.5   acre Pinnacle Phase II development parcel, located in Scottsdale, Arizona, for   $1.1 million  .  We recorded a gain on sale of   $1.0 million  .

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  Funds From Operations ( FFO ) 
    
  The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) defines FFO as net income (loss) available to common shareholders computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets, impairment charges on properties held for investment and extraordinary items, plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties, including our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships.  We calculate FFO in a manner consistent with the NAREIT definition.   
    
  Management uses FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using U.S. GAAP net income (loss) alone as the primary measure of our operating performance.  Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  Because real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself.  In addition, securities analysts, investors and other interested parties use FFO as the primary metric for comparing the relative performance of equity REITs.   
    
  FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity.  FFO does not reflect working capital changes, cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness.  Although our calculation of FFO is consistent with that of NAREIT, there can be no assurance that FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. 
    
  Funds From Operations Core ( FFO Core ) 
    
  Management believes that the computation of FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition includes certain items 
  that are not indicative of the results provided by our operating portfolio and affect the comparability of our period-over-period performance. These items include, but are not limited to, legal settlements, non-cash share-based compensation expense, rent support agreement payments received from sellers on acquired assets and acquisition costs.  Therefore, in addition to FFO, management uses FFO Core, which we define to exclude such items.  Management believes that these adjustments are appropriate in determining FFO Core as they are not indicative of the operating performance of our assets.  In addition, we believe that FFO Core is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in comparing us to other REITs as many REITs provide some form of adjusted or modified FFO.  However, there can be no assurance that FFO Core presented by us is comparable to the adjusted or modified FFO of other REITs. 
    
  Below are the calculations of FFO and FFO Core and the reconciliations to net income, which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure (in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

Property Net Operating Income ( NOI ) 
    
  Management believes that NOI is a useful measure of our property operating performance and is useful to securities analysts in estimating the relative net asset values of REITs.  We define NOI as operating revenues (rental and other revenues) less property and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes). Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, involuntary conversion, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes and gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. We use NOI to evaluate our operating performance since NOI allows us to evaluate the impact that factors such as occupancy levels, lease structure, lease rates and tenant base have on our results, margins and returns. In addition, management believes that NOI provides useful information to the investment community about our property and operating performance when compared to other REITs since NOI is generally recognized as a standard measure of property performance in the real estate industry. However, NOI should not be viewed as a measure of our overall financial performance since it does not reflect general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, involuntary conversion, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes and gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties. 
    
  Below is the calculation of NOI and the reconciliations to net income, which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure (in thousands): 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of distributions to holders of our common shares and OP units, including those required to maintain our REIT status and satisfy our current quarterly distribution target of $0.2850 per share and OP unit, recurring expenditures, such as repairs and maintenance of our properties, non-recurring expenditures, such as capital improvements and tenant improvements, debt service requirements, and, potentially, acquisitions of additional properties.   
    
       During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our cash provided from operating activities was   $27,993,000   and our total distributions were   $24,021,000  .  Therefore, we had cash flow from operations in excess of distributions of approximately   $3,972,000  .  We anticipate that cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility will provide adequate capital for our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments in the short term.  We also believe that cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity will allow us to make all distributions required for us to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.

     Table of Contents  

Our long-term capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longer-term debt agreements, development and redevelopment costs, and potential acquisitions.  We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements with net cash from operations, long-term indebtedness, sales of common shares, issuance of OP units, sales of underperforming properties and non-core properties and other financing opportunities, including debt financing.  We believe we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity.  However, our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to access the equity markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our Company.  
    
  We expect that our rental income will increase as we continue to acquire additional properties, subsequently increasing our cash flows generated from operating activities.  We intend to continue acquiring such additional properties that meet our Community Centered Property  strategy through equity issuances and debt financing.  
    
  As discussed in Note 10 (Equity) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on June 26, 2015, we completed the sale of 3,750,000 common shares at a purchase price of $13.3386 per share.  Total net proceeds from the offering, after deducting offering expenses, were approximately $49.7 million, which we contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP units.  The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the Facility and for general corporate purposes.  In addition, on June 4, 2015, we entered into the 2015 equity distribution agreements, as discussed in Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2015 equity distribution agreements, we can issue and sell up to an aggregate of $50 million of our common shares into the existing trading market at current market prices or at negotiated prices through the placement agents over a period of time and from time to time.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   1,083,926   common shares under the 2015 equity distribution agreements, with net proceeds to us of approximately   $16.1 million  .  In connection with such sales, we paid compensation of approximately   $0.2 million   to the sales agents.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   1,819,681   common shares under the 2015 equity distribution agreements, with net proceeds to us of approximately   $26.7 million  .  In connection with such sales, we paid compensation of approximately   $0.4 million   to the sales agents.  We had not sold any common shares under the 2015 equity distribution agreements as of   September 30, 2015  .  We have used and anticipate using net proceeds from common shares issued pursuant to the 2015 equity distribution agreements for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions of additional properties, the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, the expansion, redevelopment and/or re-tenanting of properties in our portfolio, working capital and other general purposes. 
    
  Our capital structure includes non-recourse mortgage debt that we have assumed or originated on certain properties. We may hedge the future cash flows of certain variable rate debt transactions principally through interest rate swaps with major financial institutions.  See Note 7 (Derivatives and Hedging Activities) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our current cash flow hedges. 
    
  As discussed in Note 2 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, pursuant to the terms of our   $15.1 million     4.99%   Note, due January 6, 2024 (see Note 6 (Debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), which is collateralized by our Anthem Marketplace property, we were required by the lenders thereunder to establish a cash management account controlled by the lenders to collect all amounts generated by our Anthem Marketplace property in order to collateralize such promissory note.  Amounts in the cash management account are classified as restricted cash. 
     
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  We had cash and cash equivalents of approximately   $8,786,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $2,587,000   on   December 31, 2015  .  The increase of   $6,199,000   was primarily the result of the following: 
    
  Sources of Cash

     Table of Contents  

Uses of Cash 

We place all cash in short-term, highly liquid investments that we believe provide appropriate safety of principal. 
    
  Debt 
    
  Debt consisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands): 

(1)   
    Promissory note includes an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate at   3.55%   for the duration of the term. 

(3)   
    Promissory note includes an interest rate swap that fixed the LIBOR portion of Term Loan 2 (as defined below) at   1.50%  . 

42 

     Table of Contents  

(4)   
    Promissory note includes an interest rate swap that fixed the LIBOR portion of Term Loan 3 (as defined below) at   1.73%  , 
       
            (5)   
    Promissory note includes an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate at   5.72%   for the duration of the term.  As part of our acquisition of Paradise Plaza in August 2012, we recorded a discount on the note of   $1.3 million  , which amortizes into interest expense over the life of the loan and results in an imputed interest rate of   4.13%  . 
       
  On November 7, 2014, we, through our Operating Partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the  2014 Facility ) with the lenders party thereto, with BMO Capital Markets, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated, and U.S. Bank, National Association, as co-lead arrangers and joint book runners, and Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent (the  Agent ). The 2014 Facility amended and restated our previous unsecured revolving credit facility.   On October 30, 2015, we, through our Operating Partnership, entered into the First Amendment to the 2014 Facility (the  First Amendment ) with the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and the Agent.  We refer to the 2014 Facility, as amended by the First Amendment, as the  Facility.  
    
  Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company made the following amendments to the 2014 Facility: 

Borrowings under the Facility accrue interest (at the Operating Partnership's option) at a Base Rate or an Adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon our then existing leverage.  The applicable margin for Adjusted LIBOR borrowings ranges from   1.40%   to   1.95%   for the Revolver and   1.35%   to   2.25%   for the Term Loans.  Base Rate means the higher of: (a) the Agent's prime commercial rate, (b) the sum of (i) the average rate quoted by the Agent by two or more federal funds brokers selected by the Agent for sale to the Agent at face value of federal funds in the secondary market in an amount equal or comparable to the principal amount for which such rate is being determined, plus (ii) 1/2 of   1.00%  , and (c) the LIBOR rate for such day plus   1.00%  . Adjusted LIBOR means LIBOR divided by one minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage. The Eurodollar Reserve Percentage means the maximum reserve percentage at which reserves are imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on eurocurrency liabilities.  
    
  We serve as the guarantor for funds borrowed by the Operating Partnership under the Facility. The Facility contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, affirmative and negative covenants such as information reporting requirements, maximum secured indebtedness to total asset value, minimum EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization or extraordinary items) to fixed charges, and maintenance of a minimum net worth. The Facility also contains customary events of default with customary notice and cure, including, without limitation, nonpayment, breach of covenant, misrepresentation of representations and warranties in a material respect, cross-default to other major indebtedness, change of control, bankruptcy and loss of REIT tax status. 
    
  The Facility includes an accordion feature that will allow the Operating Partnership to increase the borrowing capacity to   $700 million  , upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $391.6 million   was drawn on the Facility, and our remaining borrowing capacity was   $108.4 million  .  Proceeds from the Facility were used for general corporate purposes, including property acquisitions, debt repayment, capital expenditures, the expansion, redevelopment and retenanting of properties in our portfolio and working capital.  We intend to use the additional proceeds from the Facility for general corporate purposes, including property acquisitions, debt repayment, capital expenditure, the expansion, redevelopment and re-tenanting of properties in our portfolio and working capital. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our   $159.4 million   in secured debt was collateralized by   19   properties with a carrying value of   $191.2 million  .  Our loans contain restrictions that would require the payment of prepayment penalties for the acceleration of outstanding debt and are secured by deeds of trust on certain of our properties and by assignment of the rents and leases associated with those properties.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all loan covenants.

     Table of Contents  

Scheduled maturities of our outstanding debt as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands): 

Capital Expenditures 
    
  We continually evaluate our properties  performance and value.  We may determine it is in our shareholders  best interest to invest capital in properties that we believe have potential for increasing value. We also may have unexpected capital expenditures or improvements for our existing assets.  Additionally, we intend to continue investing in similar properties outside of the markets on which we focus in cities with exceptional demographics to diversify market risk, and we may incur significant capital expenditures or make improvements in connection with any properties we may acquire. 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to the information regarding specified contractual obligations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Distributions 
    
  The following table summarizes the cash distributions paid or payable to holders of our common shares and noncontrolling OP units during each quarter during   2015   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (in thousands, except per share data):

     Table of Contents  

Taxes 
    
  We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999.  As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our shareholders.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.  We believe that we are organized and operate in a manner to qualify and be taxed as a REIT, and we intend to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
    
  Income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiary, Whitestone Davenport TRS LLC ( Davenport TRS ), is subject to federal income tax.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $45,000   in income tax expense related to Davenport TRS for the 2016 taxable year. 
    
  Taxable income differs from net income for financial reporting purposes principally due to differences in the timing of recognition of interest, real estate taxes, depreciation and rental revenue.  We recorded   $49,000   in credits to tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 for the 2015 taxable year. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  Our properties are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which our operations are conducted.  From our inception, we have incurred no significant environmental costs, accrued liabilities or expenditures to mitigate or eliminate future environmental contamination. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
    
  Our future income, cash flows and fair value relevant to our financial instruments depend upon prevailing market interest rates.  Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates.  Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange rate or commodity price risk.  The principal market risk to which we are exposed is the risk related to interest rate fluctuations.  Many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk.  Our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs.  To achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable. 
    
  All of our financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes.   
    
  Fixed Interest Rate Debt 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $359.6 million  , or approximately   65%   of our outstanding debt, was subject to fixed interest rates, which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates.  Though a change in the market interest rates affects the fair market value of our fixed interest rate debt, it does not impact net income to shareholders or cash flows.  Our total outstanding fixed interest rate debt had an average effective interest rate as of   September 30, 2016   of approximately   3.84%   per annum with scheduled maturities ranging from 2016 to 2024 (see Note 6 (Debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail).  Holding other variables constant, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would cause a   $14.9 million   decline or increase, respectively, in the fair value for our fixed rate debt.   
    
  Variable Interest Rate Debt 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $191.6 million  , or approximately   35%   of our outstanding debt, was subject to floating interest rates of LIBOR plus 1.40% to 1.95% and not currently subject to a hedge.  The impact of a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates on our non-hedged variable rate debt would result in a decrease or increase of annual net income of approximately   $1.9 million  , respectively.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures. 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The management of Whitestone REIT, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to Whitestone REIT's management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and financial officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   (the end of the period covered by this Report). 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
    
  We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  These matters are generally covered by insurance.  While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
    
  There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the  Risk Factors  section of Whitestone s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as updated by Whitestone s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016.
