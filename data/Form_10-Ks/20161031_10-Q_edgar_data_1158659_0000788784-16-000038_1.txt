  Basis of Presentation 
  The financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) applicable to Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes) should be read in conjunction with, and update and supplement matters discussed in, the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly state the results for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The year-end Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards  
  New Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted 
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
  This accounting standard clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and removes inconsistencies in revenue recognition requirements; improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; and provides improved disclosures.  
  The guidance provides a five-step model to be used for recognizing revenue for the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. 
  The standard was originally to be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance deferring the effective date by one year to periods beginning after December 31, 2017. Early application will be permitted as of the original effective date. PSEG is currently analyzing the impact of this standard on its financial statements     and disclosures as well as the transition method to use to adopt the guidance. PSEG is considering the impacts of outstanding industry related issues currently being addressed by the AICPA s Revenue Recognition Working Group and the FASB s Transition Resource Group, including its ability to recognize revenue for  
  
   16 

    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 
   Table of Contents      

certain contracts where there is uncertainty regarding collection, bundled price sales contracts and accounting for contributions in aid of construction. 
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
  This accounting standard will change how entities measure equity investments that are not consolidated or accounted for under the equity method. Under the new guidance, equity investments (other than those accounted for using the equity method) will be measured at fair value through Net Income instead of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Entities that have elected the fair value option for financial liabilities will present changes in fair value due to a change in their own credit risk through Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For equity investments which do not have readily determinable fair values, the impairment assessment will be simplified by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairments. The new standard also changes certain disclosures.  
  The standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. PSEG is currently analyzing the impact of this standard on our financial statements; however, PSEG expects increased volatility in Net Income due to changes in fair value of our equity securities within the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) and Rabbi Trust Funds. 
  Leases 
  This accounting standard replaces existing lease accounting guidance and requires lessees to recognize all leases with a term greater than 12 months on the balance sheet using a right-of-use asset approach. At lease commencement, a lessee will recognize a lease asset and corresponding lease obligation. A lessee will classify its leases as either finance leases or operating leases based on whether control of the underlying assets has transferred to the lessee. A lessor will classify its leases as operating or direct financing leases, or as sales-type leases based on whether control of the underlying assets has transferred to the lessee. Both the lessee and lessor models require additional disclosure of key information. The standard requires lessees and lessors to apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. However, existing guidance related to leveraged leases will not change. 
  The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with retrospective application to previously issued financial statements for 2018 and 2017. Early application is permitted. PSEG is currently analyzing the impact of this standard on its financial statements.      
  Stock Compensation-Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
  This accounting standard was issued to simplify aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. 
  Under the new guidance, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be recognized in income tax expense rather than recognized in additional paid in capital. In the statement of cash flows, excess tax benefits and deficiencies will be classified with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity rather than a financing activity as currently classified. In addition, the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements were simplified in order to facilitate equity classification of the award. 
  The standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for an entity in any interim or annual period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period; however, the amendments within this update require different adoption methods. PSEG is evaluating early adoption of the standard in the fourth quarter of 2016; however, PSEG does not expect adoption to materially affect its financial statements.  
  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
  This accounting standard provides a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial assets carried at amortized cost. The new model requires entities to use an estimate of expected credit losses that will be recognized as an impairment allowance rather than a direct write-down of the amortized cost basis. The estimate of expected credit losses is to be based on past events, current conditions and supportable forecasts over a reasonable period. For purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, a similar model is to be used; however, the initial allowance will be added to the purchase price rather than reported as an allowance. Credit losses on available-for-sale securities should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP; however, this standard requires those credit losses to be presented as an allowance, rather than a write-down. This new standard also requires additional disclosures of credit quality indicators for each class of financial asset disaggregated by year of origination. 
  The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019; however, entities may adopt early beginning in the annual or interim periods after December 15, 2018. PSEG is currently analyzing the impact of this standard on its financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
  This accounting standard reduces the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the Statement of Cash Flows.  
  The standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017; however, entities may adopt early including in an interim period. PSEG is currently analyzing the impact of this standard on its financial statements. 

Note 3. Early Plant Retirements  
  On October 3, 2016, Power determined that it will cease generation operations of the existing coal/gas units at the Hudson and Mercer generating stations on June 1, 2017. Power has filed deactivation notices with PJM for these existing units at both stations and final must-offer exception requests for the 2020-2021 PJM capacity auction to the PJM Independent Market Monitor. Power expects the units to continue to be available to generate electricity and receive previously cleared capacity payments through the date the units cease operations. The exact timing of the early retirement of these units will be reviewed for reliability impacts by PJM, the regional transmission organization that controls the area where these units are located, and may be impacted by operational and other conditions that could subsequently arise.   
  PSEG and Power undertake their annual five year strategic planning process primarily during the third and fourth quarters of each year. The primary factors considered during this process that contributed to the decision to retire these units early include significant declines in revenues and margin caused by a sustained period of depressed wholesale power prices and reduced capacity factors caused by lower natural gas prices making coal generation less economically competitive than natural gas-fired generation. Despite experiencing recent warmer than normal weather in PJM this summer, Power did not experience the usual increase in electricity prices in PJM as it had in past hot summers. This trend has a further adverse economic impact to these units because they generally dispatch and earn energy margin on peak hot and cold days. In addition, the upcoming PJM capacity auction in May 2017 for the capacity period from June 2020 to May 2021 will be the first to require all generating units to meet the increased operating performance standards of PJM s new capacity performance regulations. During the current annual five-year strategic planning process, Power determined, on October 3, 2016, that the costs to upgrade the existing units at the Hudson and Mercer stations to comply with these higher reliability standards to be too significant and not economic given current market conditions, including anticipated future capacity prices, current forward energy prices and past operational performance results of the units. While these units have the capability to run on both coal and natural gas, they have higher operating costs and fuel consumption as well as longer start-up times compared to newer combined cycle gas units.  
  The decision to retire the Hudson and Mercer units early will have a material effect on PSEG s and Power s results of operations. In the third quarter of 2016, PSEG and Power recognized the following one-time pre-tax charges in Energy Costs, Operation and Maintenance and Depreciation expense:

In addition to these one-time charges, Power will recognize incremental Depreciation and Amortization during the remainder of 2016 of   $568 million   and   $946 million   into 2017 due to the significant shortening of the expected economic useful lives of Hudson and Mercer. Additional employee-related salary continuance and severance costs and various miscellaneous costs may also be incurred during the period prior to retirement. Finally, Power currently anticipates using the sites for alternative industrial activity. However, if Power determines not to use the sites for alternative industrial activity, the early retirement of the units at these sites would trigger investigation and possible remediation of identified environmental contamination. The amounts for any such environmental investigation or remediation are neither currently probable nor estimable but may be material. 
  PSEG and Power evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in regulation, business climate or market conditions, including a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, could potentially indicate an asset s or asset group s carrying amount may not be recoverable. In such an event, an undiscounted cash flow analysis is performed to determine if an impairment exists. When a long-lived asset s or asset group s carrying amount exceeds the associated undiscounted estimated future cash flows, the asset/asset group is considered impaired to the extent that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. As disclosed for Power, cash flows for long-lived assets and asset groups are determined at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The cash flows from the generation units are generally evaluated at a regional portfolio level (PJM, NYISO, ISO-NE) along with cash flows generated from the customer supply and risk management activities, inclusive of cash flows from contracts, including those that are accounted for as derivatives or that meet the normal purchases and normal sales exemption. An impairment would result in a reduction of the value of the long-lived asset/asset group through a noncash charge to earnings. 
  Because the Hudson and Mercer generating units will cease operations significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful lives, Power performed a recoverability test for its portfolio of generating assets in the PJM region to determine if an impairment exists. As of September 30, 2016, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the PJM asset group exceeded the carrying amount and no impairment was identified. 
  In addition, PSEG and Power continue to monitor their other coal assets, including the Keystone, Conemaugh and Bridgeport Harbor generating stations, to ensure their economic viability through the end of their designated useful lives. The precise timing of a change in useful lives may be dependent upon events out of PSEG s and Power s control and may impact their ability to operate or maintain certain assets in the future. These generating stations may be impacted by factors such as environmental legislation, co-owner capital requirements and continued depressed wholesale power prices or capacity factors, among other things. Any early retirement of our other coal units before the end of their current estimated useful lives may have a material adverse impact on PSEG s and Power s future financial results. 

Note 4. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) 
  VIEs for which PSE G is the Primary Beneficiary 
  PSE G is the primary beneficiary and consolidates two marginally capitalized VIEs, PSE G Transition Funding LLC (Transition Funding) and PSE G Transition Funding II LLC (Transition Funding II), which were created for the purpose of issuing transition bonds and purchasing bond transitional property of PSE G, which was pledged as collateral to a trustee. PSE G acted as the servicer for these entities to collect securitization transition charges authorized by the BPU. These funds were remitted to Transition Funding and Transition Funding II and were used for interest and principal payments on the transition bonds and related costs. During 2015, Transition Funding and Transition Funding II paid their final securitization bond payments and as of December 31, 2015, no further debt or related costs remained with these VIEs. Effective January 1, 2016, PSE G commenced refunding the overcollections from customers associated with these VIEs and expects to fully refund these liabilities in 2016.  
  VIE for which PSEG LI is the Primary Beneficiary 
  PSEG LI consolidates Long Island Electric Utility Servco, LLC (Servco), a marginally capitalized VIE, which was created for the purpose of operating LIPA s T D system in Long Island, New York as well as providing administrative support functions to LIPA. PSEG LI is the primary beneficiary of Servco because it directs the operations of Servco, the activity that most significantly impacts Servco s economic performance and it has the obligation to absorb losses of Servco that could potentially be significant to Servco. Such losses would be immaterial to PSEG.  
  Pursuant to the OSA, Servco s operating costs are reimbursable entirely by LIPA, and therefore, PSEG LI s risk is limited related to the activities of Servco. PSEG LI has no current obligation to provide direct financial support to Servco. In addition to reimbursement of Servco s operating costs as provided for in the OSA, PSEG LI receives an annual contract management

fee. PSEG LI s annual contractual management fee, in certain situations, could be partially offset by Servco s annual storm costs not approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, limited contingent liabilities and penalties for failing to meet certain performance metrics.  
  For transactions in which Servco acts as principal, such as transactions with its employees for labor and labor-related activities, including pension and OPEB-related transactions, Servco records revenues and the related pass-through expenditures separately in Operating Revenues and Operation and Maintenance (O M) Expense, respectively. Servco recorded   $116 million   and   $96 million   for the   three months   and   $315 million   and   $262 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, of O M costs, the full reimbursement of which was reflected in Operating Revenues. For transactions in which Servco acts as an agent for LIPA, it records revenues and the related expenses on a net basis, resulting in no impact on PSEG s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.  

Note 5. Rate Filings  
  This Note should be read in conjunction with Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  In addition to items previously reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, significant regulatory orders received and currently pending rate filings with FERC and the BPU by PSE G are as follows: 
  Transmission Formula Rate Filings   In June 2016, PSE G filed its 2015 true-up adjustment pertaining to its transmission formula rates in effect for 2015. This resulted in an adjustment of   $34 million   less than the 2015 originally filed revenues primarily due to the impact of bonus depreciation legislation enacted after PSE G filed its 2015 formula rate requirement in October 2014. PSE G had recognized the majority of this adjustment in its Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  In October 2016, the 2017 Annual Formula Rate Update was filed with FERC and requests approximately   $121 million   in increased annual transmission revenues effective January 1, 2017, subject to true-up. 
  Energy Strong Recovery Filing   In March and September of each year, PSE G files with the BPU for base rate recovery of Energy Strong investments which include a return of and on its investment. In June 2016, PSE G updated its March cost recovery petition to include Energy Strong investments in service as of May 31, 2016 which represents estimated annual increases in electric and gas revenues of   $16 million   and   $23 million  , respectively. In August 2016, the BPU approved these rate increases effective September 1, 2016. 
  In September 2016, PSE G filed its Energy Strong electric cost recovery petition seeking BPU approval to recover the revenue requirements associated with Energy Strong capitalized investment costs placed in service from June 1, 2016 through November 30, 2016. The petition requests rates to be effective March 1, 2017, consistent with the BPU Order of approval of the Energy Strong Program. The annualized requested increase in electric revenue requirement is approximately   $15 million  . This matter is pending. 
  Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS)   In June 2016, PSE G made its annual BGSS filing with the BPU requesting a reduction of   $87 million   in annual BGSS revenues. In September 2016, the BPU approved a Stipulation in this matter on a provisional basis and the BGSS rate was reduced from approximately   40 cents   to   34 cents   per therm effective October 1, 2016. The rate is subject to final settlement. 
  Weather Normalization Clause   On July 1, 2016, PSE G filed a petition requesting approval to collect   $54 million   in net deficiency gas revenues as a result of the warmer than normal 2015-2016 Winter Period. The deficiency gas revenues would be collected from customers over the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 Winter Periods (October 1 through May 31). In September 2016, the BPU approved PSE G s filing on a provisional basis with respect to the   $54 million   in deficiency revenues to be collected from customers effective October 1, 2016.   
  Solar and Energy Efficiency - Green Program Recovery Charges (GPRC)   Each year PSE G files with the BPU for annual recovery of its Green Program investments which include a return on its investment and recovery of expenses. On July 1, 2016, PSE G filed its 2016 GPRC cost recovery petition requesting recovery for the nine combined components of the electric and gas GPRC. The filing proposes rates for the period October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017 designed to recover approximately   $44 million   and   $13 million   in electric and gas revenues, respectively, on an annual basis associated with PSE G s implementation of these BPU approved programs. In September 2016, the BPU approved the July 2016 filing on a provisional basis, with new rates effective October 1, 2016. 
  Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP)   In October 2016, PSE G updated its initial annual GSMP cost recovery petition seeking BPU approval to recover in gas base rates an estimated annual revenue increase of   $10 million   effective

January 1, 2017. This increase represents the return of and on investment for GSMP investments in service through September 30, 2016. This matter is pending.   
  Universal Service Fund (USF)/Lifeline   In September  2016, the BPU approved rates set to recover state-wide costs incurred by New Jersey electric and gas distribution companies under the State s USF/Lifeline energy assistance programs effective October 1, 2016. PSE G earns no margin on the collection of the USF and Lifeline programs resulting in no impact on its Consolidated Statement of Operations.  
  Remediation Adjustment Charge (RAC)   In April 2016, the BPU approved PSE G s filing with respect to its RAC 23 petition allowing recovery of   $54 million   effective May 7, 2016 related to net Manufactured Gas Plant expenditures from August 1, 2014 through July 31, 2015. 

Note 6. Financing Receivables  
  PSE G 
  PSE G sponsors a solar loan program designed to help finance the installation of solar power systems throughout its electric service area. The loans are generally paid back with solar renewable energy certificates generated from the installed solar electric system. A substantial portion of these amounts are noncurrent and reported in Long-Term Investments on PSEG s and PSE G s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table reflects the outstanding loans by class of customer, none of which are considered  non-performing.  

Energy Holdings 
  Energy Holdings, through several of its indirect subsidiary companies, has investments in domestic energy and real estate assets subject primarily to leveraged lease accounting. A leveraged lease is typically comprised of an investment by an equity investor and debt provided by a third party debt investor. The debt is recourse only to the assets subject to lease and is not included on PSEG s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As an equity investor, Energy Holdings  investments in the leases are comprised of the total expected lease receivables on its investments over the lease terms plus the estimated residual values at the end of the lease terms, reduced for any income not yet earned on the leases. This amount is included in Long-Term Investments on PSEG s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The more rapid depreciation of the leased property for tax purposes creates tax cash flow that will be repaid to the taxing authority in later periods. As such, the liability for such taxes due is recorded in Deferred Income Taxes on PSEG s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
  During the third quarter of 2016, Energy Holdings completed its annual review of estimated residual values embedded in the NRG REMA, LLC (REMA) leveraged leases. The outcome indicated that the revised residual value estimates were lower than the recorded residual values and the decline was deemed to be other than temporary due to the adverse economic conditions experienced by coal generation in PJM, as discussed in   Note 3. Early Plant Retirements  , negatively impacting the economic outlook of the leased assets. As a result, a pre-tax write-down of   $137 million   was reflected in Operating Revenues in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , calculated by comparing the gross investment in the leases before and after the revised residual estimates.

The following table shows Energy Holdings  gross and net lease investment as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   

  The corresponding receivables associated with the lease portfolio are reflected in the following table, net of non-recourse debt. The ratings in the table represent the ratings of the entities providing payment assurance to Energy Holdings. 

The    BB-    and the    CCC    ratings in the preceding table represent lease receivables related to coal-fired assets in Illinois and Pennsylvania, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , the gross investment in the leases of such assets, net of non-recourse debt, was   $436 million   (  $(108) million  , net of deferred taxes). A more detailed description of such assets under lease, as of   September 30, 2016  , is presented in the following table. 

(A) 
    REMA notified PJM that it deactivated the coal-fired units at the Shawville generating facility in June 2015 and has disclosed that it expects to return the Shawville units to service in the late fall of 2016 with the ability to use natural gas.

(B) 
    On May 24, 2016, S P lowered its corporate credit rating on REMA s parent company, GenOn Energy Inc. (GenOn) and affiliates (including REMA) to    CCC    from  CCC+  due to a weaker forward power curve, milder weather patterns and weakening financial measures. On October 7, 2016, Moody s downgraded the GenOn Corporate Family Rating to Caa3 to reflect its high debt burden relative to cash flow. GenOn reported in August 2016 that it did not expect to have sufficient liquidity to repay the senior unsecured notes due in June 2017.  
     The credit exposure for lessors is partially mitigated through various credit enhancement mechanisms within the lease transactions. These credit enhancement features vary from lease to lease and may include letters of credit or affiliate guarantees. Upon the occurrence of certain defaults, indirect subsidiary companies of Energy Holdings would exercise their rights and attempt to seek recovery of their investment, potentially including stepping into the lease directly to protect their investments. While these actions could ultimately protect or mitigate the loss of value, they could require the use of significant capital investments and trigger certain material tax obligations which could be mitigated by tax indemnification claims with the counterparty. A bankruptcy of a lessee would likely delay and potentially limit any efforts on the part of the lessors to assert their rights upon default and could delay the monetization of claims. Failure to recover adequate value could ultimately lead to a foreclosure on the assets under lease by the lenders. Although all lease payments are current, PSEG cannot predict the outcome of GenOn s efforts to restructure its portfolio and improve its liquidity and the possible related impact on REMA. PSEG continues to monitor any changes to REMA s and GenOn s status and potential impacts on Energy Holdings  lease investments. If foreclosures were to occur, Energy Holdings could potentially record a pre-tax write-off up to its gross investment in these facilities and may also be required to pay significant cash tax liabilities to the Internal Revenue Service. 
  Although all lease payments are current, no assurances can be given that future payments in accordance with the lease contracts will continue. Factors which may impact future lease cash flows include, but are not limited to, new environmental legislation and regulation regarding air quality, water and other discharges in the process of generating electricity, market prices for fuel, electricity and capacity, overall financial condition of lease counterparties and their affiliates and the quality and condition of assets under lease.  

Note 7. Available-for-Sale Securities 
  NDT Fund 
  Power maintains an external master NDT to fund its share of decommissioning for its   five   nuclear facilities upon termination of operation. The trust contains two separate funds: a qualified fund and a non-qualified fund. Section 468A of the Internal Revenue Code limits the amount of money that can be contributed into a qualified fund. The trust funds are managed by third party investment advisers who operate under investment guidelines developed by Power.  
  Power classifies investments in the NDT Fund as available-for-sale. The following tables show the fair values and gross unrealized gains and losses for the securities held in the NDT Fund.

     Gross realized gains and gross realized losses disclosed in the preceding table were recognized in Other Income and Other Deductions, respectively, in PSEG s and Power s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net unrealized gains of   $131 million   (after-tax) were a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss on PSEG s and Power s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The NDT available-for-sale debt securities held as of   September 30, 2016   had the following maturities: 

The cost of these securities was determined on the basis of specific identification. 
  Power periodically assesses individual securities whose fair value is less than amortized cost to determine whether the investments are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. For equity securities, management considers the ability and intent to hold for a reasonable time to permit recovery in addition to the severity and duration of the loss. For fixed income securities, management considers its intent to sell or requirement to sell a security prior to expected recovery. In those cases where a sale is expected, any impairment would be recorded through earnings. For fixed income securities where there is no intent to sell or likely requirement to sell, management evaluates whether credit loss is a component of the impairment. If so, that portion is recorded through earnings while the noncredit loss component is recorded through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , other-than-temporary impairments of   $25 million   were recognized on securities in the NDT Fund. Any subsequent recoveries in the value of these securities would be recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) unless the securities are sold, in which case, any gain would be recognized in income. The assessment of fair market value compared to cost is applied on a weighted average basis taking into account various purchase dates and initial cost of the securities.

The Rabbi Trust available-for-sale debt securities held as of   September 30, 2016   had the following maturities: 

The cost of these securities was determined on the basis of specific identification. 
  PSEG periodically assesses individual securities whose fair value is less than amortized cost to determine whether the investments are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. For equity securities, the Rabbi Trust is invested in a commingled indexed mutual fund. Due to the commingled nature of this fund, PSEG does not have the ability to hold these securities until expected recovery. As a result, any declines in fair market value below cost are recorded as a charge to earnings. For fixed income securities, management considers its intent to sell or requirement to sell a security prior to expected recovery. In those cases where a sale is expected, any impairment would be recorded through earnings. For fixed income securities where there is no intent to sell or likely requirement to sell, management evaluates whether credit loss is a component of the impairment. If so, that portion is recorded through earnings while the noncredit loss component is recorded through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , no other-than-temporary impairments were recognized on securities in the Rabbi Trust. The assessment of fair market value compared to cost is applied on a weighted average basis taking into account various purchase dates and initial cost of the securities. 
  The fair value of assets in the Rabbi Trust related to PSEG, PSE G and Power are detailed as follows: 

Note 8. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB) 
  PSEG sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension plans and OPEB plans covering PSEG s and its participating affiliates  current and former employees who meet certain eligibility criteria.  
  Effective January 1, 2016, PSEG changed the approach used to measure future service and interest costs for pension benefits. For 2015 and prior, PSEG calculated service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. For 2016 and beyond, PSEG has elected to calculate service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans  liability cash flows. PSEG believes the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans  liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. This change does not affect the measurement of the plan obligations. As a change in accounting estimate, this change is being reflected prospectively. Pension and OPEB costs, net of amounts capitalized, were reduced by   $9 million   and   $3 million  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $26 million   and   $9 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the 2016 amounts that would have been derived from applying PSEG s 2015 and prior years  methodology.

The following table provides the components of net periodic benefit costs relating to all qualified and nonqualified pension and OPEB plans on an aggregate basis for PSEG, except for Servco.   

Pension and OPEB costs for PSE G, Power and PSEG s other subsidiaries, except for Servco, are detailed as follows:   

  PSEG contributed its entire planned contributions for the year   2016   of   $21 million   into its pension plans and   $14 million   into its OPEB plan during   2016  . 
  Servco Pension and OPEB 
  At the direction of LIPA, Servco sponsors benefit plans that cover its current and former employees who meet certain eligibility criteria. Under the OSA, all of these and any future employee benefit costs are to be funded by LIPA. See   Note 4. Variable Interest Entities  . These obligations, as well as the offsetting long-term receivable, are separately presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of PSEG.  
  Servco amounts are not included in any of the preceding pension and OPEB benefit cost disclosures. Pension and OPEB costs of Servco are accounted for according to the OSA. Servco recognizes expenses for contributions to its pension plan trusts and for OPEB payments made to retirees. Operating Revenues are recognized for the reimbursement of these costs. Servco has contributed its entire planned contribution of   $28 million   into its pension plan trusts during   2016  . Servco s pension-related revenues and costs were   $16 million   and   $17 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $28 million   and   $30 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The OPEB-related revenues earned and costs incurred for each of the   three months   and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were immaterial.

Note 9. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
  Guaranteed Obligations 
  Power s activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of energy and related products under transportation, physical, financial and forward contracts at fixed and variable prices. These transactions are with numerous counterparties and brokers that may require cash, cash-related instruments or guarantees. 
  Power has unconditionally guaranteed payments to counterparties by its subsidiaries in commodity-related transactions in order to 
             
    support current exposure, interest and other costs on sums due and payable in the ordinary course of business, and 
                
    obtain credit. 
     Under these agreements, guarantees cover lines of credit between entities and are often reciprocal in nature. The exposure between counterparties can move in either direction. 
  In order for Power to incur a liability for the face value of the outstanding guarantees, its subsidiaries would have to 
             
    fully utilize the credit granted to them by every counterparty to whom Power has provided a guarantee, and 
                
    all of the related contracts would have to be  out-of-the-money  (if the contracts are terminated, Power would owe money to the counterparties). 
     Power believes the probability of this result is unlikely. For this reason, Power believes that the current exposure at any point in time is a more meaningful representation of the potential liability under these guarantees. Current exposure consists of the net of accounts receivable and accounts payable and the forward value on open positions, less any collateral posted. 
  Power is subject to 
             
    counterparty collateral calls related to commodity contracts, and 
                
    certain creditworthiness standards as guarantor under performance guarantees of its subsidiaries. 
     Changes in commodity prices can have a material impact on collateral requirements under such contracts, which are posted and received primarily in the form of cash and letters of credit. Power also routinely enters into futures and options transactions for electricity and natural gas as part of its operations. These futures contracts usually require a cash margin deposit with brokers, which can change based on market movement and in accordance with exchange rules. 
  In addition to the guarantees discussed above, Power has also provided payment guarantees to third parties on behalf of its affiliated companies. These guarantees support various other non-commodity related contractual obligations.

The following table shows the face value of Power s outstanding guarantees, current exposure and margin positions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

As part of determining credit exposure, Power nets receivables and payables with the corresponding net energy contract balances. See   Note 11. Financial Risk Management Activities   for further discussion. In accordance with PSEG s accounting policy, where it is applicable, cash (received)/deposited is allocated against derivative asset and liability positions with the same counterparty on the face of the Balance Sheet. The remaining balances of net cash (received)/deposited after allocation are generally included in Accounts Payable and Receivable, respectively. 
  In addition to amounts for outstanding guarantees, current exposure and margin positions, PSEG and Power had posted letters of credit to support Power s various other non-energy contractual and environmental obligations. See preceding table. PSEG also issued a   $106 million   guarantee to support Power s payment obligations related to its equity interest in the PennEast natural gas pipeline and a   $21 million   guarantee to support Power s payment obligations related to construction of a 755 MW gas-fired combined cycle generating station in Maryland. In the event that PSEG were to be downgraded to below investment grade and failed to meet minimum net worth requirements, these guarantees would each have to be replaced by a letter of credit. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
  Passaic River  
  Historic operations of PSEG companies and the operations of hundreds of other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by Federal and State agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex in violation of various statutes as discussed as follows. 
  Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) 
  In 2002, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that a   17  -mile stretch of the lower Passaic River from Newark to Clifton, New Jersey is a  Superfund  site under CERCLA. This designation allows the EPA to clean up such sites and to compel responsible parties to perform cleanups or reimburse the government for cleanups led by the EPA. 
  The EPA determined that there was a need to perform a comprehensive study of the entire   17   miles of the lower Passaic River. PSE G and certain of its predecessors conducted operations at properties in this area of the Passaic River. The properties included   one   operating electric generating station (Essex Site), which was transferred to Power,   one   former generating station and   four   former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites.  
  In early 2007,   73   Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs), including PSE G and Power, formed a Cooperating Parties Group (CPG) and agreed to assume responsibility for conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) of the   17

miles of the lower Passaic River. At such time, the CPG also agreed to allocate, on an interim basis, the associated costs of the RI/FS among its members on the basis of a mutually agreed upon formula. For the purpose of this interim allocation, which has been revised as parties have exited the CPG, approximately   seven percent   of the RI/FS costs are currently deemed attributable to PSE G s former MGP sites and approximately   one percent   is attributable to Power s generating stations. These interim allocations are not binding on PSE G or Power in terms of their respective shares of the costs that will be ultimately required to remediate the 17 miles of the lower Passaic River. PSEG has provided notice to insurers concerning this potential claim.   
  In June 2008, the EPA and Tierra Solutions, Inc. (Tierra) and Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus) entered into an early action agreement whereby Tierra/Maxus agreed to remove a portion of the heavily dioxin-contaminated sediment located in the lower Passaic River. The portion of the Passaic River identified in this agreement was located immediately adjacent to Tierra/Maxus  predecessor company s (Diamond Shamrock) facility. Pursuant to the agreement between the EPA and Tierra/Maxus, the estimated cost for the work to remove the sediment in this location was   $80 million  . Phase I of the removal work has been completed. Pursuant to this agreement, Tierra/Maxus have reserved their rights to seek contribution for these removal costs from the other PRPs, including Power and PSE G.  
  In 2012, Tierra/Maxus withdrew from the CPG and refused to participate as members going forward, other than with respect to their obligation to fund the EPA s portion of its RI/FS oversight costs. At such time, the remaining members of the CPG, in agreement with the EPA, commenced the removal of certain contaminated sediments at Passaic River Mile 10.9 at an estimated cost of   $25 million   to   $30 million  . Construction is complete. The CPG is awaiting EPA approval of the construction report, long-term monitoring plan and confirmatory sampling plan. PSE G s and Power s combined share of the cost of that effort is approximately   three percent  . The remaining CPG members have reserved their rights to seek reimbursement from Tierra/Maxus for the costs of the River Mile 10.9 removal. 
  On April 11, 2014, the EPA released its revised draft  Focused Feasibility Study  (FFS) which contemplated the removal of   4.3 million   cubic yards of sediment from the bottom of the lower   eight   miles of the 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River. The revised draft FFS set forth various alternatives for remediating this portion of the Passaic River.  
  The CPG, which consisted of   52   members as of   September 30, 2016  , provided a draft RI and draft FS, both relating to the entire 17 miles of the lower Passaic River, to the EPA on February 18, 2015 and April 30, 2015, respectively. The estimated total cost for the preparation of the RI/FS is approximately   $167 million  , which the CPG continues to incur. Of the estimated   $167 million  , as of   September 30, 2016  , the CPG had spent approximately   $156 million  , of which PSE G s and Power s combined share was approximately   $10 million  . 
  The CPG s draft FS set forth various alternatives for remediating the lower Passaic River. It set forth the CPG s estimated costs to remediate the lower 17 miles of the Passaic River which range from approximately   $518 million   to   $3.2 billion   on an undiscounted basis. The CPG identified a targeted remedy in the draft FS which would involve removal, treatment and disposal of contaminated sediments taken from targeted locations within the entire 17 miles of the lower Passaic River. The estimated cost in the draft FS for the targeted remedy ranged from approximately   $518 million   to   $772 million  . Based on (i) the low end of the range of the current estimates of costs to remediate, (ii) PSE G s and Power s estimated share of those costs, and (iii) the continued ability of PSE G to recover such costs in its rates, PSE G accrued a   $10 million   Environmental Costs Liability and a corresponding Regulatory Asset and Power accrued a   $3 million   Other Noncurrent Liability and a corresponding O M Expense in the first quarter of 2015.  
  In March 2016, the EPA released its Record of Decision (ROD) for the FFS which requires the removal of 3.5 million cubic yards of sediment from the Passaic River s lower 8.3 miles at an estimated cost of   $2.3 billion   on an undiscounted basis (ROD Remedy). The ROD Remedy requires a bank-to-bank dredge ranging from approximately 5 to 30 feet deep in the federal navigation channel from River Mile 0 to River Mile 1.7 and an approximately 2.5 foot deep dredge everywhere else in the lower 8.3 miles of the river. An engineered cap approximately two feet thick will be placed over the dredged areas. Dredged sediments will be transported to facilities and landfills out-of-state. The EPA estimates the total project length to be about 11 years, including a one year period of negotiation with the PRPs, three to four years to design the project and six years for implementation.  
  Based upon the estimated cost of the ROD Remedy, PSEG s estimate of PSE G s and Power s shares of that cost, and the continued ability of PSE G to recover such costs in its rates, PSE G accrued an additional   $36 million   Environmental Costs Liability and a corresponding Regulatory Asset and Power accrued an additional   $8 million   Other Noncurrent Liability and a corresponding O M Expense in the first quarter of 2016.   As of September 30, 2016  , these accruals bring the total liability to approximately   $57 million  ,   $46 million   applicable to PSE G and   $11 million   applicable to Power.  
  Also in March 2016, the EPA sent a notice letter to 105 PRPs, including PSE G, all other past and present members of the CPG, including Occidental Chemical Corporation (OCC), and the towns of Newark, Kearny and Harrison and the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission stating that the EPA wants to determine whether OCC, a successor company to Diamond

Shamrock, would voluntarily perform the remedial design for the ROD Remedy. On September 30, 2016, OCC and the EPA executed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for Remedial Design under which OCC agreed to conduct the remedial design for the ROD. With OCC s commitment to perform the remedial design, it is anticipated that the EPA will begin negotiation of a remedial action consent decree, under which OCC and the other  major PRPs  will implement and/or pay for the EPA s ROD Remedy for the lower 8.3 miles. The EPA has not defined  major PRP.  
  On June 16, 2016, Tierra and Maxus, successors to Diamond Shamrock, filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Although PSEG does not currently anticipate that the filing for bankruptcy by Tierra and Maxus will affect its allocable share or total liability for the Passaic River matter, PSEG, through the CPG and independently, will monitor the bankruptcy proceedings to identify any potential impact on PSEG s share of the costs. 
  The EPA has broad authority to implement its selected remedy through the ROD and PSEG cannot at this time predict how the implementation of the ROD might impact PSE G s and Power s ultimate liability. Until (i) the RI/FS, which covers the entire 17 miles of the lower Passaic River, is finalized either in whole or in part, (ii) an agreement by the PRPs to perform either the ROD Remedy as issued, or an amended ROD Remedy determined through negotiation or litigation, and an agreed upon remedy for the remaining 8.7 miles of the river, are reached, (iii) PSE G s and Power s respective shares of the costs, both in the aggregate as well as individually, are determined, and (iv) PSE G s continued ability to recover the costs in its rates is determined, it is not possible to predict this matter s ultimate impact on PSEG s financial statements. It is possible that PSE G and Power will record additional costs beyond what they have accrued, and that such costs could be material, but PSEG cannot at the current time estimate the amount or range of any additional costs.  
  Natural Resource Damage Claims 
  In 2003, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) directed PSEG, PSE G and   56   other PRPs to arrange for a natural resource damage assessment and interim compensatory restoration of natural resource injuries along the lower Passaic River and its tributaries pursuant to the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act. The NJDEP alleged that hazardous substances had been discharged from the Essex Site and the Harrison Site. The NJDEP estimated the cost of interim natural resource injury restoration activities along the lower Passaic River at approximately   $950 million  . In 2007, agencies of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of the Interior (the Passaic River federal trustees) sent letters to PSE G and other PRPs inviting participation in an assessment of injuries to natural resources that the agencies intended to perform. In 2008, PSEG and a number of other PRPs agreed to share certain immaterial costs the trustees have incurred and will incur going forward, and to work with the trustees to explore whether some or all of the trustees  claims can be resolved in a cooperative fashion. That effort is continuing. PSE G and Power are unable to estimate their respective portions of the possible loss or range of loss related to this matter.                         
  Newark Bay Study Area 
  The EPA has established the Newark Bay Study Area, which it defines as Newark Bay and portions of the Hackensack River, the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull. In August 2006, the EPA sent PSEG and   11   other entities notices that it considered each of the entities to be a PRP with respect to contamination in the Study Area. The notice letter requested that the PRPs fund an EPA-approved study in the Newark Bay Study Area. The notice stated the EPA s belief that hazardous substances were released from sites owned by PSEG companies and located on the Hackensack River, including   two   operating electric generating stations (Hudson and Kearny sites) and   one   former MGP site. PSEG has participated in and partially funded the second phase of this study. Notices to fund the next phase of the study have been received but PSEG has not consented to fund the third phase. PSE G and Power are unable to estimate their respective portions of the possible loss or range of loss related to this matter. 
  MGP Remediation Program 
  PSE G is working with the NJDEP to assess, investigate and remediate environmental conditions at its former MGP sites. To date, 38 sites requiring some level of remedial action have been identified. Based on its current studies, PSE G has determined that the estimated cost to remediate all MGP sites to completion could range between   $424 million   and   $481 million   through     2021, including its   $46 million   share for the Passaic River accrued as of   September 30, 2016  , as discussed above. Since no amount within the range is considered to be most likely, PSE G has recorded a liability of   $424 million   as of     September 30, 2016  . Of this amount,   $70 million   was recorded in Other Current Liabilities and   $354 million   was reflected as Environmental Costs in Noncurrent Liabilities. PSE G has recorded a   $424 million     Regulatory Asset with respect to these costs. PSE G periodically updates its studies taking into account any new regulations or new information which could impact future remediation costs and adjusts its recorded liability accordingly. NJDEP, PSEG and EPA representatives have had discussions regarding whether sampling in the Passaic River is required to delineate coal tar from MGP sites that abut the Passaic River Superfund site. PSEG cannot determine at this time whether this will have an impact on the Passaic River Superfund remedy.

Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)/New Source Review (NSR) 
  The PSD/NSR regulations, promulgated under the Clean Air Act (CAA), require major sources of certain air pollutants to obtain permits, install pollution control technology and obtain offsets, in some circumstances, when those sources undergo a  major modification,  as defined in the regulations. The federal government may order companies that are not in compliance with the PSD/NSR regulations to install the best available control technology at the affected plants and to pay monetary penalties ranging from   $25,000   to   $37,500   per day for each violation, depending upon when the alleged violation occurred. 
  In 2009, the EPA issued a notice of violation to Power and the other owners of the Keystone coal-fired plant in Pennsylvania, alleging, among other things, that various capital improvement projects were completed at the plant which are considered modifications (or major modifications) causing significant net emission increases of PSD/NSR air pollutants, beginning in 1985 for Keystone Unit 1 and in 1984 for Keystone Unit 2. The notice of violation states that none of these modifications underwent the PSD/NSR permitting process prior to being put into service, which the EPA alleges was required under the CAA. The notice of violation states that the EPA may issue an order requiring compliance with the relevant CAA provisions and may seek injunctive relief and/or civil penalties. Power owns approximately   23%   of the plant. Power cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
  Clean Water Act Permit Renewals 
  Pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits expire within   five   years of their effective date. In order to renew these permits, but allow a plant to continue to operate, an owner or operator must file a permit application no later than   six   months prior to expiration of the permit. States with delegated federal authority for this program manage these permits. The NJDEP manages the permits under the New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) program. Connecticut and New York also have permits to manage their respective pollutant discharge elimination system programs. 
  On May 19, 2014, the EPA issued a final rule that establishes new requirements for the regulation of cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and industrial facilities with a design flow of more than   two million   gallons of water per day. On August 15, 2014, the EPA established October 14, 2014 as the effective date for each state to implement the provisions of the rule going forward when considering the renewal of permits for existing facilities on a case by case basis. On September 5, 2014, several environmental non-governmental groups and certain energy industry groups filed motions to litigate the provisions of the rule. This case is pending at the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals. In two related actions on October 17, 2014 and November 20, 2014, several environmental non-governmental groups initiated challenges to the endangered species act provisions of the 316 (b) rule. Power is unable to determine the ultimate impact of these actions on the implementation of the rule.  
  On June 10, 2016, the NJDEP issued a final NJPDES permit for Salem with an effective date of August 1, 2016. The final permit does not require installation of cooling towers and allows Salem to continue to operate utilizing the existing once-through cooling water system. The final permit does not mandate specific service water system modifications, but consistent with Section 316 (b) of the Clean Water Act, it requires additional studies and the selection of technology to address impingement for the service water system. On July 8, 2016, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network (Riverkeeper) filed a request challenging the NJDEP s issuance of the final permit for Salem. The Riverkeeper s filing does not change the effective date of the permit. If the Riverkeeper s challenge were successful, Power may be required to incur additional costs to comply with the Clean Water Act. Such service water system modification costs could be material and could adversely impact the economic competitiveness of this facility. 
  State permitting decisions at Bridgeport and possibly New Haven could also have a material impact on Power s ability to renew permits at its existing larger once-through cooled plants without making significant upgrades to existing intake structures and cooling systems.   
  Power is unable to predict the outcome of these permitting decisions and the effect, if any, that they may have on Power s future capital requirements, financial condition or results of operations. 
  Power is actively engaged with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CTDEEP) regarding renewal of the current permit for the cooling water intake structure at Bridgeport Harbor Station Unit 3 (BH3). To address compliance with the EPA s Clean Water Act Section 316(b) final rule, the current proposal under consideration is that, if a final permit is issued, Power would continue to operate BH3 without making the capital expenditures for modification to the existing intake structure and retire BH3 in 2021, which is four years earlier than the current estimated useful life ending in 2025. Based on current discussions with the CTDEEP, if the proposal is accepted, a final permit could be issued in late 2016.  
  Separately, Power has also negotiated a Community Environmental Benefit Agreement (CEBA) with the City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. That CEBA provides that Power would retire BH3 early if all its precedent conditions occur, which include receipt  
  
   34 

    NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 
   Table of Contents      

of all final permits to build and operate a proposed new combined cycle generating facility on the same site that BH3 currently operates. The receipt of permits to allow construction and operation of the new facility could occur in 2017. Absent those conditions being met, and the permit for the cooling water intake structure referred to above not being issued, Power will seek to operate BH3 through the current estimated useful life.   
  In February 2016, the proposed new generating facility at Bridgeport Harbor was awarded a capacity obligation. Operations are expected to begin in mid-2019.   
  Bridgeport Harbor National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Compliance 
  In April 2015, Power determined that monitoring and reporting practices related to certain permitted wastewater discharges at its Bridgeport Harbor station may have violated conditions of the station s NPDES permit and applicable regulations and could subject it to fines and penalties. Power has notified the CTDEEP of the issues and has taken actions to investigate and resolve the potential non-compliance. Power cannot predict the impact of this matter. 
  Jersey City, New Jersey Subsurface Feeder Cable Matter 
  In early October 2016, a discharge of mineral oil dielectric fluid from subsurface feeder cables located in the Hudson River near Jersey City, New Jersey, was identified and reported to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). The feeder cables are located within a subsurface easement granted to PSE G by the property owners, Newport Associates Development Company (NADC) and Newport Associates Phase I Developer Limited Partnership. The feeder cables are subject to agreements between PSE G and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison) and are jointly owned by PSE G and Con Edison, with PSE G owning the portion of the cables located in New Jersey and Con Edison owning the portion of the cables located in New York. The NJDEP has declared an emergency and an emergency response action has been undertaken to investigate, contain, remediate and stop the fluid discharge; to assess, repair and restore the cables to good working order; and to restore the property. The U.S. Coast Guard has issued Notices of Federal Interest for an Oil Pollution Incident, to the property owners, PSE G and Con Edison, and the NJDEP has issued a Field Directive to both PSE G and Con Edison. The investigation and response actions related to the fluid discharge are ongoing. The investigation of the discharge and its potential cause is in the preliminary stages, making it difficult to determine the timing and potential costs to resolve this matter, as well as responsibility for such costs between PSE G, Con Edison and NADC; however, based on currently available information and the potential scope of the necessary repair and remediation work, the costs could be material.    
  Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines 
  On September 30, 2015, the EPA issued a new Effluent Guidelines Limitation Rule for steam electric generating units. The rule establishes new best available technology economically achievable (BAT) standards for fly ash transport water, bottom ash transport water, flue gas desulfurization and flue gas mercury control wastewater. The EPA provides an implementation period for currently existing discharges of three years or up to eight years if a facility needs more time to implement equipment upgrades and provide supporting information to its permitting authority. In the intervening time period, existing discharge standards continue to apply. Power s Bridgeport Harbor station and the jointly-owned Keystone and Conemaugh stations, have bottom ash transport water discharges that are regulated under this rule. Power is unable to predict if this rule will have a material impact on its future capital requirements, financial condition and results of operations.   
  Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs) 
  On December 19, 2014, the EPA issued a final rule which regulates CCRs as non-hazardous and requires that facility owners implement a series of actions to close or upgrade existing CCR surface impoundments and/or landfills. It also establishes new provisions for the construction of new surface impoundments and landfills. Power s Hudson and Mercer generating stations, along with its co-owned Keystone and Conemaugh stations, are subject to the provisions of this rule. On April 17, 2015, the final rule was published with an effective date of October 19, 2015. Accordingly in June 2015, Power recorded an additional asset retirement obligation to comply with the final CCR rule which was not material to Power s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
  Basic Generation Service (BGS) and Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) 
  PSE G obtains its electric supply requirements through the annual New Jersey BGS auctions for two categories of customers who choose not to purchase electric supply from third party suppliers. The first category, which represents about 80% of PSE G s load requirement, is residential and smaller commercial and industrial customers (BGS-Residential Small Commercial Pricing (RSCP)). The second category is larger customers that exceed a BPU-established load (kW) threshold (BGS-Commercial and Industrial Energy Pricing (CIEP)). Pursuant to applicable BPU rules, PSE G enters into the Supplier Master Agreement with the winners of these BGS auctions following the BPU s approval of the auction results. PSE G has entered into contracts with winning BGS suppliers, including Power, to purchase BGS for PSE G s load requirements. The winners of the auction (including Power) are responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of a PJM Load Serving Entity

including the provision of capacity, energy, ancillary services, transmission and any other services required by PJM. BGS suppliers assume all volume risk and customer migration risk and must satisfy New Jersey s renewable portfolio standards. 
  The BGS-CIEP auction is for a one-year supply period from June 1 to May 31 with the BGS-CIEP auction price measured in dollars per MW-day for capacity. The final price for the BGS-CIEP auction year commencing June 1, 2016 is   $335.33   per MW-day, replacing the BGS-CIEP auction year price ending May 31, 2016 of   $272.78   per MW-day. Energy for BGS-CIEP is priced at hourly PJM locational marginal prices for the contract period.  
  PSE G contracts for its anticipated BGS-RSCP load on a three-year rolling basis, whereby each year one-third of the load is procured for a three-year period. The contract prices in dollars per MWh for the BGS-RSCP supply, as well as the approximate load, are as follows: 

Power seeks to mitigate volatility in its results by contracting in advance for the sale of most of its anticipated electric output as well as its anticipated fuel needs. As part of its objective, Power has entered into contracts to directly supply PSE G and other New Jersey electric distribution companies (EDCs) with a portion of their respective BGS requirements through the New Jersey BGS auction process, described above. 
  PSE G has a full-requirements contract with Power to meet the gas supply requirements of PSE G s gas customers. Power has entered into hedges for a portion of these anticipated BGSS obligations, as permitted by the BPU. The BPU permits PSE G to recover the cost of gas hedging up to   115 billion   cubic feet or   80%   of its residential gas supply annual requirements through the BGSS tariff. Current plans call for Power to hedge on behalf of PSE G approximately   70 billion   cubic feet or   50%   of its residential gas supply annual requirements. For additional information, see   Note 18. Related-Party Transactions  . 
  Minimum Fuel Purchase Requirements 
  Power s nuclear fuel strategy is to maintain certain levels of uranium and to make periodic purchases to support such levels. As such, the commitments referred to in the following table may include estimated quantities to be purchased that deviate from contractual nominal quantities. Power s nuclear fuel commitments cover approximately   100%   of its estimated uranium, enrichment and fabrication requirements through 2017 and a significant portion through 2020 at Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom. 
  Power has various multi-year contracts for natural gas and firm transportation and storage capacity for natural gas that are primarily used to meet its obligations to PSE G. When there is excess delivery capacity available beyond the needs of PSE G s customers, Power can use the gas to supply its fossil generating stations.   
  Power also has various long-term fuel purchase commitments for coal through 2018 to support its fossil generation stations. 
  As of September 30, 2016  , the total minimum purchase requirements included in these commitments were as follows:

Regulatory Proceedings 
  FERC Compliance  
  In the first quarter of 2014, Power discovered that it incorrectly calculated certain components of its cost-based bids for its New Jersey fossil generating units in the PJM energy market. Upon discovery of the errors, PSEG retained outside counsel to assist in the conduct of an investigation into the matter and self-reported the errors. As the internal investigation proceeded, additional pricing errors in the bids were identified. It was further determined that the quantity of energy that Power offered into the energy market for its fossil peaking units differed from the amount for which Power was compensated in the capacity market for those units. PSEG informed FERC, PJM and the PJM Independent Market Monitor (IMM) of these additional issues, corrected the identified errors, and modified the bid quantities for Power s peaking units. Power continues to implement procedures to help mitigate the risk of similar issues occurring in the future. 
  During the   three month   period ended   March 31, 2014  , based upon its best estimate available at the time, Power recorded a charge to income in the amount of   $25 million   related to this matter. No additional charges to income have been recorded for this matter since that time. 
  Since September 2014, FERC Staff has been conducting a preliminary, non-public staff investigation into the matter and issued data requests covering a period from 2002 through the date of the self-report. This investigation is ongoing. Since that time, Power has responded to data requests from FERC Staff, including recent data requests in which Power has recalculated certain of its energy bids in PJM for a five year period, and may receive additional data requests or other fact finding. The FERC Staff investigation is still in the fact finding stage and there is considerable uncertainty around FERC s response to PSEG s legal arguments and the amount of disgorgement or other remedies FERC may ultimately seek.  
  PSEG is unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible loss for this matter; however, the amounts of potential disgorgement and other potential penalties that Power may incur span a wide range depending on the success of PSEG s legal arguments. These arguments include that Power s energy market bids in a substantial majority of the hours were below the allowed rate under the Tariff and therefore any errors in those hours were immaterial and that it is unclear whether the quantity of the bids violated any legal requirement. If PSEG s legal arguments do not prevail in whole or in part with FERC or in a     judicial challenge that PSEG may choose to pursue, it is likely that Power would record additional losses and that such additional losses would be material to PSEG s and Power s Consolidated Statements of Operations in the quarterly and annual periods in which they are recorded. 
  Nuclear Insurance Coverages 
  The following should be read in conjunction with Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  Based upon a review of its nuclear insurance, Power made changes to its Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) insurance coverage of the excess layer for property damage which became effective on April 1, 2016. The excess layer provides coverage above the primary layer of NEIL insurance coverage for property damage of   $1.5 billion  . For the excess layer at the Salem/Hope Creek site, Power purchased coverage for property damage of   $300 million   due to a nuclear event and   $300 million   due to a non-nuclear event. For the excess layer at the Peach Bottom site, Power purchased coverage for its ownership interest for property damage of   $300 million   due to a nuclear event. For the excess layer at the Peach Bottom site, Exelon purchased coverage for property damage of   $600 million   due to a non-nuclear event which covers the ownership interest of Power.

     Power 
       
  Short-Term Liquidity 
  PSEG meets its short-term liquidity requirements, as well as those of Power, primarily with cash and through the issuance of commercial paper. PSE G maintains its own separate commercial paper program to meet its short-term liquidity requirements. Each commercial paper program is fully back-stopped by its own separate credit facilities. 
  The commitments under PSEG s   $4.2 billion   credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group with no single institution representing more than   7%   of the total commitments in PSEG s credit facilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , PSEG s total available credit capacity of   $3.7 billion   was in excess of its anticipated maximum liquidity requirements. 
  Each of PSEG s credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed in the following table; however, if necessary, the PSEG facilities can also be used to support its subsidiaries  liquidity needs. PSEG s total credit facilities and available liquidity as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

(D) 
    The primary use of PSEG s and PSE G s credit facilities is to support their respective CP Programs. As of   September 30, 2016  , PSEG had   $255 million   outstanding under its CP Program at a weighted average interest rate of   0.79%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , PSE G had no amounts outstanding under its CP Program.

Note 11. Financial Risk Management Activities 
  The operations of PSEG, Power and PSE G are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices that could affect their results of operations and financial condition. Exposure to these risks is managed through normal operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through hedging transactions. Hedging transactions use derivative instruments to create a relationship in which changes to the value of the assets, liabilities or anticipated transactions exposed to market risks are expected to be offset by changes in the value of these derivative instruments. 
  Derivative accounting guidance requires that a derivative instrument be recognized as either an asset or a liability at fair value, with changes in fair value of the derivative recognized in earnings each period. Other accounting treatments are available through special election and designation provided that the derivative instrument meets specific, restrictive criteria, both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis. These alternative permissible treatments include normal purchase normal sale (NPNS), cash flow hedge and fair value hedge accounting. PSEG, Power and PSE G have applied the NPNS scope exception to certain derivative contracts for the forward sale of generation, power procurement agreements and fuel agreements. Transactions receiving NPNS treatment are accounted for upon settlement. For a derivative instrument that qualifies and is designated as a cash flow hedge, the changes in the fair value of such a derivative that are highly effective are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. For a derivative instrument that qualifies and is designated as a fair value hedge, the gains or losses on the derivative as well as the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings each period. Power and PSE G enter into additional contracts that are derivatives, but are not designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. These transactions are economic hedges and are recorded at fair market value. 
  Commodity Prices 
  Within PSEG and its affiliate companies, Power has the most exposure to commodity price risk. Power is exposed to price risk primarily relating to changes in the market price of electricity, fossil fuels and other commodities. Fluctuations in market prices result from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market conditions, weather, state and federal regulatory policies, environmental policies, transmission availability and other factors. Power uses a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage the commodity price risk of its electric generation facilities, including physical and financial transactions in the wholesale energy markets to mitigate the effects of adverse movements in fuel and electricity prices. The fair value for the majority of these contracts is obtained from quoted market sources. Modeling techniques using assumptions reflective of current market rates, yield curves and forward prices are used to interpolate certain prices when no quoted market exists. PSEG had no commodity derivative transactions designated as cash flow or fair value hedges as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   
  Economic Hedges 
  Power enters into derivative contracts that are not designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges. Power enters into financial options, futures, swaps, fuel purchases and forward purchases and sales of electricity. These transactions are economic hedges, intended to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and optimize the value of Power s expected generation. Changes in the fair market value of these contracts are recorded in earnings. PSE G is a party to a long-term natural gas sales derivative contract to     optimize its pipeline capacity utilization. Changes in the fair market value of the contract are recorded in Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities. 
  Interest Rates 
  PSEG, Power and PSE G are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Exposure to this risk is managed by targeting a balanced debt maturity profile which limits refinancing in any given period or interest rate environment. In addition, they have used a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps. 
  Fair Value Hedges  
  PSEG enters into fair value hedges to convert fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. The changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are fully offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying forecasted interest payments of the debt. Interest rate swaps totaling   $550 million   that converted the retired Power s Senior Notes due September 2016 into variable-rate debt matured in the third quarter. There were no outstanding interest rate swaps as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of all the underlying hedges was   $6 million  . The effect of these hedges reduced interest expense by   $2 million   and   $5 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $6 million   and   $15 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Cash Flow Hedges  
  PSEG uses interest rate swaps and other derivatives, which are designated and effective as cash flow hedges, to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to variable-rate debt instruments. As of   September 30, 2016  , PSEG had interest rate hedges outstanding totaling   $500 million  . These hedges convert PSEG s   $500 million   variable rate term loan due November 2017 into a fixed rate loan  .   The fair value of these hedges and the related ineffectiveness were immaterial as of   September 30, 2016  . PSEG interest rate hedges totaling   $400 million   were terminated during the second quarter and a gain of   $2 million   was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (after tax) and will amortize to interest expense over the remaining life of Power s   $700 million   of   3%   Senior Notes due June 2021. For additional information see   Note 10. Debt and Credit Facilities  . There were no outstanding interest rate cash flow hedges as of   December 31, 2015  . The Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (after tax) related to existing and terminated interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was   $2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and was immaterial as of   December 31, 2015  . The after-tax unrealized gains on these hedges expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months are immaterial. The expiration date of the longest-dated interest rate hedge is in   May 2021  . 
  Fair Values of Derivative Instruments 
  The following are the fair values of derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following tables also include disclosures for offsetting derivative assets and liabilities which are subject to a master netting or similar agreement. In general, the terms of the agreements provide that in the event of an early termination the counterparties have the right to offset amounts owed or owing under that and any other agreement with the same counterparty. Accordingly, and in accordance with PSEG s accounting policy, these positions have been offset on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets of Power, PSE G and PSEG. The following tabular disclosure does not include the offsetting of trade receivables and payables.

(A) 
    Substantially all of Power s and PSEG s derivative instruments are contracts subject to master netting agreements. Contracts not subject to master netting or similar agreements are immaterial and did not have any collateral posted or received as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . PSE G does not have any derivative contracts subject to master netting or similar agreements.  
              (B) 
    Represents the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty (where the right of offset exists) and the application of collateral. All cash collateral received or posted that has been allocated to derivative positions, where the right of offset exists, has been offset on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , net cash collateral (received) paid of   $(18) million   and   $(55) million  , respectively, were netted against the corresponding net derivative contract positions. Of the   $(18) million   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $(13) million   and   $(14) million   of cash collateral were netted against current assets and noncurrent assets, respectively, and   $9 million   was netted against current liabilities. Of the   $(55) million   as of   December 31, 2015  ,   $(53) million   and   $(16) million   were netted against current assets and noncurrent assets, respectively, and   $12 million   and   $2 million   were netted against current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. 
     Certain of Power s derivative instruments contain provisions that require Power to post collateral. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon Power s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. These credit risk-related contingent features stipulate that if Power were to be downgraded to a below investment grade rating, it would be required to provide additional collateral. A below investment grade credit rating for Power would represent a three level downgrade from its current S P and Moody s ratings. This incremental collateral requirement can offset collateral requirements related to other derivative instruments that are assets with the same counterparty, where the contractual right of offset exists under applicable master agreements. Power also enters into commodity transactions on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). The NYMEX and ICE clearing houses act as counterparties to each trade. Transactions on the NYMEX and ICE must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margin requirements. 
  The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a liability position that are not fully collateralized (excluding transactions on the NYMEX and ICE that are fully collateralized, and contracts designated as NPNS) was   $42 million   and   $78 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Power had the contractual right of offset of   $11 million   and   $12 million  , respectively, related to derivative instruments that are assets with the same counterparty under agreements and net of margin posted. If Power had been downgraded to a below investment grade rating, it would have had additional collateral obligations of   $31 million   and   $66 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, related to its derivatives, net of the contractual right of offset under master agreements and the application of collateral.

Credit Risk 
  Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of non-performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. We have established credit policies that we believe significantly minimize credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties  financial condition (including credit rating), collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements, which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. In the event of non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on Power s and PSEG s financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   92%   of the net credit exposure for Power s operations was with investment grade counterparties. Credit exposure is defined as any positive results of netting accounts receivable/accounts payable and the forward value of open positions (which includes all financial instruments including derivatives and non-derivatives and normal purchases/normal sales). 
  The following table provides information on Power s credit risk from others, net of collateral, as of   September 30, 2016  . It further delineates that exposure by the credit rating of the counterparties and provides guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties and an indication of the quality of Power s credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties. 

(A) 
    Represents net exposure of   $114 million   with PSE G. The remaining net exposure of   $33 million   is with a non-affiliated power purchaser which is an investment grade counterparty. 
     As of September 30, 2016  , collateral held from counterparties where Power had credit exposure included   $3 million   in cash collateral and   $133 million   in letters of credit.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Power had   135   active counterparties. 
  PSE G s supplier master agreements are approved by the BPU and govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts. These agreements define a supplier s performance assurance requirements and allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier s credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day the procurement transaction is executed, compared to the forward price curve for energy on the valuation day. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post a parental guaranty or other security instrument such as a letter of credit or cash, as collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier s unsecured credit limit.   As of September 30, 2016  , primarily all of the posted collateral was in the form of parental guarantees. The unsecured credit used by the suppliers represents PSE G s net credit exposure. PSE G s suppliers  credit exposure is calculated each business day.   As of September 30, 2016  , PSE G had no net credit exposure with suppliers, including Power.   
  PSE G is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the BPU-approved BGS tariffs. PSE G s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates.

Note 12. Fair Value Measurements  
  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Accounting guidance for fair value measurement emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources and those based on an entity s own assumptions. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to fair value measurement into three levels: 
  Level 1 measurements utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that PSEG, PSE G and Power have the ability to access. These consist primarily of listed equity securities and money market mutual funds. 
  Level 2 measurements include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and other observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. These consist primarily of non-exchange traded derivatives such as forward contracts or options and most fixed income securities. 
  Level 3 measurements use unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities, based on the best information available and might include an entity s own data and assumptions. In some valuations, the inputs used may fall into different levels of the hierarchy. In these cases, the financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.   As of September 30, 2016  , these consisted primarily of long-term gas supply contracts and certain electric load contracts. 
  The following tables present information about PSEG s, PSE G s and Power s respective assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , including the fair value measurements and the levels of inputs used in determining those fair values. Amounts shown for PSEG include the amounts shown for PSE G and Power.

              (B) 
    Level 2 Fair values for energy-related contracts are obtained primarily using a market-based approach. Most derivative contracts (forward purchase or sale contracts and swaps) are valued using the average of the bid/ask

midpoints from multiple broker or dealer quotes or auction prices. Prices used in the valuation process are also corroborated independently by management to determine that values are based on actual transaction data or, in the absence of transactions, bid and offers for the day. Examples may include certain exchange and non-exchange traded capacity and electricity contracts and natural gas physical or swap contracts based on market prices, basis adjustments and other premiums where adjustments and premiums are not considered significant to the overall inputs. 
  Level 3 For energy-related contracts, which include more complex agreements where limited observable inputs or pricing information are available, modeling techniques are employed using assumptions reflective of contractual terms, current market rates, forward price curves, discount rates and risk factors, as applicable. Fair values of other energy contracts may be based on broker quotes that we cannot corroborate with actual market transaction data. 
           (C) 
    Interest rate swaps are valued using quoted prices on commonly quoted intervals, which are interpolated for periods different than the quoted intervals, as inputs to a market valuation model. Market inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment.  
              (D) 
    The NDT Fund maintains investments in various equity and fixed income securities classified as  available for sale.  The Rabbi Trust maintains investments in an S P 500 index fund and various fixed income securities classified as  available for sale.  These securities are generally valued with prices that are either exchange provided (equity securities) or market transactions for comparable securities and/or broker quotes (fixed income securities). 
     Level 1 Investments in marketable equity securities within the NDT Fund are primarily investments in common stocks across a broad range of industries and sectors. Most equity securities are priced utilizing the principal market close price or, in some cases, midpoint, bid or ask price. Certain open-ended mutual funds with mainly short-term investments are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets. The Rabbi Trust equity index fund is valued based on quoted prices in an active market. 
  Level 2 NDT and Rabbi Trust fixed income securities are limited to investment grade corporate bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations, asset backed securities and government obligations or Federal Agency asset-backed securities with a wide range of maturities. Since many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, they are priced using an evaluated pricing methodology that varies by asset class and reflects observable market information such as the most recent exchange price or quoted bid for similar securities. Market-based standard inputs typically include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes and issuer spreads. Certain short-term investments are valued using observable market prices or market parameters such as time-to-maturity, coupon rate, quality rating and current yield. 
           (E) 
    Represents the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty (where the right of offset exists) and the application of collateral. All cash collateral received or posted that has been allocated to derivative positions, where the right of offset exists, has been offset in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.   As of September 30, 2016  , net cash collateral (received) paid of   $(18) million   was netted against the corresponding net derivative contract positions. Of the   $(18) million   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $(27) million   of cash collateral was netted against assets, and   $9 million   was netted against liabilities.   As of December 31, 2015  , net cash collateral (received) paid of   $(55) million   was netted against the corresponding net derivative contract positions. Of the   $(55) million   of cash collateral as of   December 31, 2015  ,   $(69) million   was netted against assets, and   $14 million   was netted against liabilities.  
     Additional Information Regarding Level 3 Measurements 
  For valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is categorized in Level 3. This includes derivatives valued using indicative price quotations for contracts with tenors that extend into periods with no observable pricing. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 because the model inputs generally are not observable. PSEG s Risk Management Committee approves risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The Risk Management Committee reports to the Audit Committee of the PSEG Board of Directors on the scope of the risk management activities and is responsible for approving all valuation procedures at PSEG. Forward price curves for the power market utilized by Power to manage the portfolio are maintained and reviewed by PSEG s Enterprise Risk Management market pricing group and used for financial reporting purposes. PSEG considers credit and nonperformance risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in Levels 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data, in its assessment of credit and nonperformance risk by counterparty. The impacts of credit and nonperformance risk were not material to the financial statements.

  Significant unobservable inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above Level 3 instruments if they were adjusted. For gas supply contracts where PSE G is a seller, an increase in gas transportation cost would increase the fair value. For energy-related contracts in cases where Power is a seller, an increase in the load variability would decrease the fair value.

    PSEG s and Power s gains and losses attributable to changes in net derivative assets and liabilities include   $4 million   and   $12 million   in Operating Income for the   three months   and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Of the   $4 million   in Operating Income,   $3 million   is unrealized. Of the   $12 million   in Operating Income,   $(6) million   is unrealized. 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , PSEG carried   $2.6 billion   of net assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, of which   $11 million   of net assets were measured using unobservable inputs and classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  
  As of   September 30, 2015  , PSEG carried   $2.3 billion   of net assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, of which   $2 million   of net assets were measured using unobservable inputs and classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  
  Fair Value of Debt 
  The estimated fair values were determined using the market quotations or values of instruments with similar terms, credit ratings, remaining maturities and redemptions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

(A) 
    Fair value includes a $500 million floating rate term loan and net offsets to debt resulting from adjustments from interest rate swaps entered into to hedge certain debt at Power. The fair value of the term loan debt (Level 2 measurement) was considered to be equal to the carrying value because the interest payments are based on LIBOR rates that are reset monthly. Carrying amount includes such fair value reduced by the unamortized premium resulting from a debt exchange entered into between Power and Energy Holdings. 
              (B) 
    Given that most bonds do not trade, the fair value amounts of taxable debt securities (primarily Level 2 measurements) are generally determined by a valuation model that is based on a conventional discounted cash flow methodology and utilizes assumptions of current market pricing curves. In order to incorporate the credit risk into the discount rates, pricing is obtained (i.e. U.S. Treasury rate plus credit spread) based on expected new issue pricing across each of the companies  respective debt maturity spectrum. The credit spreads of various tenors obtained from this information are added to the appropriate benchmark U.S. Treasury rates in order to determine the current market yields for the various tenors. The yields are then converted into discount rates of various tenors that are used for discounting the respective cash flows of the same tenor for each bond or note.

Note 14. Income Taxes 
  PSEG s, PSE G s and Power s effective tax rates for the   three months   and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

For the   three months   and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the overall decreases in PSEG s effective tax rates as compared to the same periods in the prior year as well as to the statutory tax rate of 40.85%, were due primarily to changes in uncertain tax positions and plant related items. 
  For the   three months   and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the overall decreases in PSE G s effective tax rates as compared to the same periods in the prior year as well as to the statutory tax rate of 40.85%, were due primarily to changes in uncertain tax positions and plant and other flow through items. 
  The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended the   50%   bonus depreciation rules for qualified property placed in service before January 1, 2015 and for long production property placed in service in 2015.  
  The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (Tax Act) extended the   50%   bonus depreciation rules for qualified property placed in service from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. The rate is reduced to   40%   and   30%   for eligible property placed in service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In addition, long production property placed in service in 2020 will also qualify for   30%   bonus depreciation. The Tax Act also extended the   30%   ITC for qualified property placed in service starting January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2019 but reduces the ITC rate to   26%   and   22%   for projects commenced in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The financial impact of the extensions of the ITC rate will depend upon future transactions. 
  These provisions have generated significant cash tax benefits for PSEG, PSE G and Power through tax benefits related to the accelerated depreciation. These tax benefits would have otherwise been received over an estimated average 20 year period. However, these tax benefits will have a negative impact on the rate base of several of PSE G s programs.

  Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing Net Income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, including shares issuable upon exercise of stock options outstanding or vesting of restricted stock awards granted under PSEG s stock compensation plans and upon payment of performance units or restricted stock units. The following table shows the effect of these stock options, performance units and restricted stock units on the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in calculating diluted EPS: 

There were approximately   0.4 million   stock options excluded from the weighted average common shares used for diluted EPS due to their antidilutive effect for the   three months   and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Financial Results  
  The results for PSEG, PSE G and Power for the   three months   and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are presented as follows: 

(A) 
    Includes after-tax expenses of   $67 million   related to the early retirement of Power s Hudson and Mercer coal/gas generation plants in the   three months   and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . See Item 1.   Note 3. Early Plant Retirements   for additional information.  
              (B) 
    Includes an after-tax insurance recovery for Superstorm Sandy of   $102 million   in the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
              (C) 
    Other includes activities at the parent company, PSEG LI, and Energy Holdings as well as intercompany eliminations. Energy Holdings recorded an after-tax impairment of   $86 million   related to its investments in NRG REMA, LLC s leveraged leases in the   three months   and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . See Item 1.   Note 6. Financing Receivables   for further information. 
     Power s results above include the realized gains, losses and earnings on the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) Fund and other related NDT activity and the impacts of non-trading mark-to-market (MTM) activity, which consist of the financial impact from positions with future delivery dates. 
  The variances in our Net Income include the changes related to NDT and MTM shown in the following table:  

(A) 
    NDT Fund Income (Expense) includes the realized gains and losses, interest and dividend income and other costs related to the NDT Fund which are recorded in Other Income and Deductions, and impairments on certain NDT securities recorded as Other-Than-Temporary Impairments. Interest accretion expense on Power s nuclear Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) is recorded in Operation and Maintenance (O M) Expense and the depreciation related to the ARO asset is recorded in Depreciation and Amortization Expense.  
       Our   $112 million   decrease in Net Income for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   was driven primarily by    
               
    an impairment related to investments in certain leveraged leases at Energy Holdings (See Item 1.   Note 6. Financing Receivables  ),  
                
    charges related to the early retirement of two coal/gas generation units at Power (See Item 1.   Note 3. Early Plant Retirements  ), and  
     
   67 

Table of Contents  

lower volumes of energy sold at lower average realized prices and lower capacity revenues, primarily in the PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) region.  
     These decreases were partially offset by 
             
    higher revenues due to increased investments in transmission projects, 
                
    higher electricity sales under non-BGS wholesale load contracts in PJM and New England (NE) and higher volumes of electricity sold at higher prices under our Basic Generation Service (BGS) contracts, and 
                
    lower other-than-temporary impairments of the NDT Fund. 
     Our   $385 million   decrease in Net Income for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was driven primarily by    
             
    the aforementioned charges in the 2016 third quarter for the early retirement of the two coal/gas generation units at Power, 
                 
    lower volumes of energy sold at lower average realized sales prices, 
                
    lower capacity and operating reserve revenues in PJM, 
                
    higher 2016 congestion costs in PJM as a result of credits received in 2015 due to extremely colder weather, 
                
    lower volumes of gas sold at lower average prices under the Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) contract, 
                
    insurance recoveries received primarily by Power in 2015 related to Superstorm Sandy, and  
                
    the aforementioned third quarter 2016 impairment on leveraged leases at Energy Holdings.  
     These decreases were partially offset by 
             
    lower generation costs driven by lower fuel costs, particularly for natural gas, and reduced generation output at     Power, 
        higher costs incurred at Power for planned outages in 2015, and  
             
    higher revenues due to increased investments in transmission projects.  
     During the first   nine months   of 2016, we maintained a strong balance sheet. We continued to effectively deploy capital without the need for additional equity, while our solid credit ratings aided our ability to access capital and credit markets. The greater emphasis on capital spending for projects on which we receive contemporaneous returns at PSE G, our regulated utility, in recent years has yielded strong results and allowed us to increase our dividend. These actions to transition our business to meet market conditions and investor expectations reflect our multi-year, long-term approach to managing our company. Our focus has been to invest capital in T D and other infrastructure projects aimed at maintaining service reliability to our customers and bolstering our system resiliency. At Power, our merchant generator, we strive to improve performance and reduce costs in order to enhance the value of our generation fleet in light of low gas prices, environmental considerations and competitive market forces that reward efficiency and reliability. 
  At PSE G, in 2016 we continue to make investments to improve the resiliency of our gas and electric distribution system as part of our Energy Strong program that was approved by the BPU in 2014 and to seek recovery on such investments. We also commenced modernizing PSE G s gas distribution systems as part of our Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP) that was approved by the BPU in late 2015. Over the past few years, these types of investments have altered our business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE G. In 2017, as a result of our Energy Strong Order from the BPU, we will be required to file a Distribution rate case proceeding. We cannot predict the impact such proceeding will have on our distribution business. 
  Despite the unseasonable warm winter weather patterns in 2016, Power s results benefited from access to natural gas supplies through existing firm pipeline transportation contracts. Power manages these contracts for the benefit of PSE G s customers through the BGSS arrangement. The contracts are sized to provide for delivery of a reliable gas supply to PSE G customers on peak winter days. When pipeline capacity beyond the customers  needs is available, Power can use it to make third party sales and supply gas to its generating units in New Jersey. Alternatively, gas supply and pipeline capacity constraints could adversely impact our ability to meet the needs of our utility customers and generating units. Power s strategic hedging practices and ability to capitalize on market opportunities help it to balance some of the volatility of the merchant power business.  
  Our recent investments in the latter half of 2015 and early 2016 in Keys Energy Center (Keys), Sewaren 7 and Bridgeport Harbor Station 5 (BH5) reflect our recognition of the value of opportunistic growth in the Power business. These additions to  
  
   68

our fleet both expand our geographic diversity and adjust our fuel mix and are expected to contribute to the overall efficiency of operations. 
  Since 2013, eight nuclear generating stations in the United States have closed or announced early retirement due to economic reasons, and four additional stations have been announced as being at risk for early retirement. This situation is generally due to low natural gas prices resulting from the growth of shale gas production since 2007, the continuing cost of regulatory compliance for nuclear facilities and both federal and state-level policies that provide credits to renewable energy such as wind and solar, but do not apply to nuclear generating stations. These trends have significantly reduced the revenues to nuclear generating stations while simultaneously raising the unit cost of production. This may result in the electric generation industry experiencing a shift from nuclear generation to natural gas-fired generation, creating greater reliance on natural gas pipelines for delivery and less diversity of the generation fleet.  
  If trends noted above continue or worsen, our nuclear generating units could cease being economically competitive which may cause us to retire such units prior to the end of their useful lives. The costs associated with any such retirement, which may include, among other things, accelerated depreciation and amortization or impairment charges, accelerated asset retirement costs, severance costs and environmental remediation costs, could be material. We continue to advocate for sound policies that recognize nuclear power as a source of clean energy and an important part of a diverse and reliable energy portfolio.   
  Regulatory, Legislative and Other Developments  
  In our pursuit of operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, we closely monitor and engage with stakeholders on significant regulatory and legislative developments. Transmission planning rules and wholesale power market design are of particular importance to our results and we continue to advocate for policies and rules that promote fair and efficient electricity markets. 
  Transmission  
  In April 2013, PJM initiated its first  open window  solicitation process to allow both incumbents and non-incumbents the opportunity to submit transmission project proposals to address identified high voltage issues in New Jersey. In February 2016, FERC issued an order granting PSE G s request that it be permitted to seek recovery of 100% of its portion of prudently incurred Artificial Island project costs if the project is cancelled for reasons beyond PSE G s control. In April 2016, PSE G accepted construction responsibility for three components of the Artificial Island project that PJM assigned to us. On August 5, 2016, PJM announced that it has suspended the Artificial Island transmission project and is performing a comprehensive analysis to determine a future course of action, which is expected to be completed by February 2017. We may also from time to time have opportunities to submit transmission project proposals in regions where we are not the incumbent. However, there can be no assurance that any such proposals would be successful.  
  In April 2016, PJM filed at FERC to incorporate a voltage threshold into PJM s Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) process to exempt, except under certain circumstances, reliability violations on facilities below 200 kV from PJM s proposal window process. We generally support this reform as a measure to improve the efficiency of the open window procedure that will permit transmission developers to focus on the projects most likely to benefit from a competitive process.     
  There are several matters pending before FERC that concern the allocation of costs associated with transmission projects being constructed by PSE G. Regardless of how these proceedings are resolved, PSE G s ability to recover the costs of these projects will not be affected. However, the result of these proceedings could ultimately impact the amount of costs borne by ratepayers in New Jersey and may cause increased scrutiny regarding PSE G s future capital investments. In addition, as a basic generation service (BGS) supplier, Power provides services that include specified transmission costs. If the allocation of the costs associated with the transmission projects were to increase these BGS-related transmission costs, BGS suppliers may be entitled to an adjustment, subject to BPU approval. We do not believe that these matters will have a material effect on Power s business or results of operations. 
  Several complaints have been filed and several remain pending at FERC against transmission owners around the country, challenging those transmission owners  base return on equity (ROE). Certain of those complaints have resulted in decisions and others have been settled, resulting in reductions of those transmission owners  base ROEs. While we are not the subject of a challenge to the ROE employed in PSE G s transmission formula rate, the results of these other proceedings could set precedents for other transmission owners with formula rates in place, including PSE G.

Wholesale Power Market Design 
  Capacity market design, including the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) in PJM, remains an important focus for us. In June 2015, FERC conditionally accepted a proposal from PJM for a capacity performance product to include generators, Demand Response and energy efficiency providers, which will be required to perform during emergency conditions, as a supplement to the base capacity product. The proposal included enhanced performance-based incentives and penalties. We believe that the auction pricing adequately reflects the increased costs that could result from operating under more stringent rules for generation availability. Based on the auction results, the capacity performance mechanism appears to have provided the opportunity for enhanced capacity market revenue streams for Power, but future impacts cannot be assured. Further, there may be requirements for additional investment and there are additional performance and financial risks. Appeals of FERC s capacity performance orders are pending. 
  In May 2016, PJM announced the results of the RPM capacity auction for the 2019-2020 delivery year. Power cleared 8,895 MW of its generating capacity at an average price of $116 per MW-day for the 2019-2020 delivery period. Of the cleared capacity, Power believes that nearly all is compliant with PJM s capacity performance requirements. In the two prior capacity auctions covering the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 delivery years, Power cleared approximately 8,700 MW at average prices of $177 per MW-day and $215 per MW-day, respectively. Prices in the most recent auction reflect PJM s downwardly-revised demand forecast, changes in the emergency transfer limits due to transmission expansion and the effects of both the new generation and uncleared generation from the prior year s auction. 
  As a result of the efforts of certain entities in PJM to obtain financial support arrangements from their state commission, a group of suppliers requested that FERC direct PJM to expand the currently effective  minimum offer price rule  to apply to certain existing units seeking subsidies. The suppliers  request was intended to avoid a scenario where the subsidized generators would submit bids into the PJM capacity market that did not reflect their actual costs of operation and could artificially suppress capacity market prices. We are currently awaiting FERC action on the suppliers  request and cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding. See Part II, Item 5. Other Information Federal Regulation Capacity Market Issues PJM for additional information. 
  Environmental Regulation  
  We continue to advocate for the development and implementation of fair and reasonable rules by the EPA and state environmental regulators. In particular, section 316(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) requires that cooling water intake structures, which are a significant part of the generation of electricity at steam-electric generating stations, reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Implementation of Section     316(b) and related state regulations could adversely impact future nuclear and fossil operations and costs. See Item 1. Note 9. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further information.  
  In October 2015, the EPA published the Clean Power Plan (CPP), a greenhouse gas emissions regulation under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for existing power plants. The regulation establishes state-specific emission targets based on implementation of the best systems of emission reduction. We continue to work with FERC and other federal and state regulators, as well as industry partners, to determine the potential impact of these regulations. 
  The U.S. Supreme Court s February 2016 decision to stay the implementation of the CPP will delay deadlines for submission of state requests for extensions and final plans. If the CPP is upheld, new deadlines will need to be established and the effective date of the compliance period may be impacted.  
  We are subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. In particular, the historic operations of PSEG companies and the operations of numerous other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by Federal and State agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex in violation of various     statutes. We are also currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, and the costs of any such remediation efforts could be material. 
  For further information regarding the matters described above as well as other matters that may impact our financial condition and results of operations, see Item 1. Note 9. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 
  FERC Compliance  
  Since September 2014, FERC Staff has been conducting a preliminary non-public investigation regarding errors in the calculation of certain components of Power s cost-based bids for its New Jersey fossil generating units in the PJM energy market and the quantity of energy that Power offered into the energy market for its fossil peaking units compared to the amounts for which Power was compensated in the capacity market for those units. This investigation is ongoing. The amounts of potential disgorgement and other potential penalties that we may incur span a wide range depending on the success of our legal arguments. If our legal arguments do not prevail, in whole or in part with FERC or in a judicial challenge that we may

choose to pursue, it is likely that Power would record losses that would be material to PSEG s and Power s results of operations in the quarterly and annual periods in which they are recorded. For additional information, see Item 1. Note 9. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 
  Early Retirement of Hudson and Mercer Units 
  In October 2016, Power determined it will cease generation operations of the existing coal/gas units at the Hudson and Mercer generating stations on June 1, 2017. The exact timing of the early retirement of these units will be reviewed for reliability impacts by PJM, and may be impacted by operational and other conditions that could subsequently arise. The decision to retire the Hudson and Mercer units will have a material effect on PSEG s and Power s results of operations. In the third quarter of 2016, PSEG and Power recognized one-time pre-tax charges in Energy Costs, Operation and Maintenance and Depreciation and Amortization of $62 million, $48 million and $4 million, respectively, related to coal inventory adjustments, capacity penalties, materials and supplies inventory reserve adjustments for parts that cannot be used at other generating units, employee-related severance benefits costs, construction work in progress impairments, and asset retirement obligation (ARO) adjustments, among other shut down items. In addition to these one-time charges, Power will recognize incremental Depreciation and Amortization during the remainder of 2016 of $568 million and $946 million into 2017 due to the significant shortening of the expected economic useful lives of Hudson and Mercer. Additional employee-related salary continuance and severance costs and various miscellaneous costs may also be incurred during the period prior to retirement. Finally, Power currently anticipates using the sites for alternative industrial activity. However, if Power determines not to use the sites for alternative industrial activity, the early retirement of the units at such sites would trigger investigation and possible remediation of identified environmental contamination. The amounts for any such environmental investigation or remediation are not currently probable or estimable but may be material. For additional information, including our estimated costs through 2017, see Item 1.   Note 3. Early Plant Retirements  .  
  The primary factors considered during our annual five-year strategic planning process that contributed to the decision to retire these units early include significant declines in revenues and margin caused by a sustained period of depressed wholesale power prices and reduced capacity factors caused by lower natural gas prices making coal generation less economically competitive than natural gas-fired generation. Despite experiencing recent warmer than normal weather in PJM this summer, Power did not experience the usual increase in electricity prices in PJM as it had in past hot summers. This trend has a further adverse economic impact to these units because they generally dispatch and earn energy margin on peak hot and cold days. In addition, the upcoming PJM capacity auction in May 2017 will be the first to require all generating units to meet the increased operating performance standards of PJM s new capacity performance construct. Power determined that the costs to upgrade the existing units at the Hudson and Mercer stations to be able to comply with these higher reliability standards are too significant and not economic given current market conditions.   
  In addition, PSEG and Power continue to monitor their other coal assets, including the Keystone, Conemaugh and Bridgeport Harbor generating stations, to ensure their economic viability through the end of their designated useful lives. The precise timing of a change in useful lives may be dependent upon events out of PSEG s and Power s control and may impact our ability to operate or maintain certain assets in the future. These generating stations may be impacted by factors such as environmental legislation, co-owner capital requirements and continued depressed wholesale power prices or capacity factors, among other things. Any early retirement of our other coal units before the end of their current estimated useful lives may have a material adverse impact on PSEG s and Power s future financial results. 
  Leveraged Lease Impairments 
  During the third quarter of 2016, Energy Holdings completed its annual review of estimated residual values embedded in the NRG REMA, LLC (REMA) leveraged leases. The outcome indicated that the revised residual value estimates were lower than the recorded residual values and the decline was deemed to be other than temporary due to the adverse economic conditions experienced by coal generation in PJM, as discussed in   Note 3. Early Plant Retirements  , negatively impacting the economic outlook of the leased assets. As a result, a pre-tax write-down of   $137 million   was reflected in Operating Revenues in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , calculated by comparing the gross investment in the leases before and after the revised residual estimates. There can be no assurance that a continuation or worsening of the adverse economic conditions would not lead to additional write-downs at any of our other generation units in our leveraged lease portfolio, and such write-downs could be material.  
  Additional facilities in our leveraged lease portfolio include the Joliet facility, which has converted to natural gas. The coal-fired units at the Shawville generating facility are expected to return to service in the fall of 2016 with the ability to use natural gas. However, these units may have higher operating costs and fuel consumption as well as longer start-up times compared to newer combined cycle gas units. As a result, these facilities may not be as economically competitive as newer combined cycle gas units and could continue to be adversely impacted by the same economic conditions experienced by coal generation facilities, which could require Energy Holdings to write down the residual value of the leveraged leases associated with these facilities.

REMA s parent company, GenOn Energy, Inc. (GenOn), reported in August 2016 that it did not expect to have sufficient liquidity to repay their senior unsecured notes due in June 2017. Although all lease payments are current, PSEG cannot predict the outcome of GenOn s efforts to restructure its portfolio and improve its liquidity and the possible related impact on REMA. PSEG continues to monitor any changes to REMA s and GenOn s status and potential impacts on Energy Holdings  lease investments, which could include further write-downs of the values of Energy Holdings  leveraged leases. 
  Salem Operations 
  The previously announced bolt replacement at Salem Unit 1 was completed and the unit returned to service on July 30, 2016. We expect to continue to inspect and replace degraded bolts at both Salem units over the next several refueling outage cycles. We are participating with the Electric Power Research Institute, the Nuclear Energy Institute and other operators of similarly-designed pressurized water reactors in developing a strategy to maintain the long-term health of the reactor vessel internals.  
  Extension of the Salem Unit 1 outage into July and an unplanned outage at Salem Unit 2 due to transformer issues reduced output from the Salem units in the third quarter, which was partially offset by increased production at our Hope Creek and Peach Bottom units. As a result, our nuclear capacity factor for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 88%. 
    
  Operational Excellence 
  We emphasize operational performance while developing opportunities in both our competitive and regulated businesses. Flexibility in our generating fleet has allowed us to take advantage of opportunities in a rapidly evolving market as we remain diligent in managing costs. For the first   nine months   of   2016  , our 
               
    diverse fuel mix and dispatch flexibility allowed us to generate approximately   40   terra-watt hours while addressing fuel availability and price volatility and compensating for the extended outages at our Salem units, and 
                
    combined cycle fleet produced 13 terawatt hours at an average capacity factor of 63%. 
     Financial Strength  
  Our financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive operating cash flow and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. Our financial position remained strong during the first   nine months   of   2016   as we 
                
    maintained solid investment grade credit ratings, and 
      We expect to be able to fund our planned capital requirements, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources, without the issuance of new equity. 
  Disciplined Investment  
  We utilize rigorous investment criteria when deploying capital and seek to invest in areas that complement our existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns. These areas include upgrading our energy infrastructure, responding to trends in environmental protection and providing new energy supplies in domestic markets with growing demand. In the first   nine months   of 2016, we 
             
    made additional investments in transmission infrastructure projects, 
                
    began executing our GSMP and continued executing Energy Strong and other existing BPU-approved utility programs,  
                
    commenced construction of our Keys and Sewaren 7 generation projects for targeted commercial operation in 2018 and announced our plan to construct BH5 and commence operations in mid-2019, and 
                
    acquired three solar energy projects totaling 100 MW-direct current. Two of these projects are already in service in North Carolina and Colorado. The third project is in Colorado and expected to be in service by year end. 
     Future Outlook     
  Our future success will depend on our ability to continue to maintain strong operational and financial performance in a slow-growing economy and a cost-constrained environment with low gas prices, to capitalize on or otherwise address appropriately regulatory and legislative developments that impact our business and to respond to the issues and challenges described below. In order to do this, we must continue to:   
             
    focus on controlling costs while maintaining safety and reliability and complying with applicable standards and requirements,  
     
   72 

Table of Contents  

successfully manage our energy obligations and re-contract our open supply positions in response to changes in demand, 
                
    execute our utility capital investment program, including our Energy Strong program, GSMP and other investments for growth that yield contemporaneous and reasonable risk-adjusted returns, while enhancing the resiliency of our infrastructure and maintaining the reliability of the service we provide to our customers, 
                
    effectively manage construction of our Keys, Sewaren 7, BH5 and other generation projects,

    engage multiple stakeholders, including regulators, government officials, customers and investors, and 
                
    successfully operate the LIPA T D system and manage LIPA s fuel supply and generation dispatch obligations.  
     For 2016 and beyond, the key issues and challenges we expect our business to confront include: 
             
    regulatory and political uncertainty, both with regard to future energy policy, design of energy and capacity markets, transmission policy and environmental regulation, as well as with respect to the outcome of any legal, regulatory or other proceeding, settlement, investigation or claim, applicable to us and/or the energy industry,  
                
    fair and timely rate relief from the BPU and FERC for recovery of costs and return on investments, including with respect to our base rate case which must be filed with the BPU no later than November 1, 2017, 
                
    uncertainty in the slowly improving national and regional economic recovery, continuing customer conservation efforts, changes in energy usage patterns and evolving technologies, which impact customer behaviors and demand,  
                
    the potential for continued reductions in demand and sustained lower natural gas and electricity prices, both at market hubs and the locations where we operate,  
                
    the impact of lower natural gas prices and increasing environmental compliance costs on the competitiveness of our nuclear and remaining coal-fired generation plants, and the potential for retirement of such plants earlier than their current useful lives, 
                
    delays and other obstacles that might arise in connection with the construction of our T D, generation and other development projects, including in connection with permitting and regulatory approvals,  
                
    maintaining a diverse mix of fuels to mitigate risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles, and 
                
    FERC Staff s continuing investigation of certain of Power s New Jersey fossil generating unit bids in the PJM energy market. 
     Our primary investment opportunities are in two areas: our regulated utility business and our merchant power business. We continually assess a broad range of strategic options to maximize long-term stockholder value. In assessing our options, we consider a wide variety of factors, including the performance and prospects of our businesses; the views of investors, regulators and rating agencies; our existing indebtedness and restrictions it imposes; and tax considerations, among other things. Strategic options available to us include: 
             
    the acquisition, construction or disposition of transmission and distribution facilities and/or generation units, 
                
    the disposition or reorganization of our merchant generation business or other existing businesses or the acquisition or development of new businesses,  
                
    the expansion of our geographic footprint, 
                
    continued or expanded participation in solar, demand response and energy efficiency programs, and  
                
    investments in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, improvements to system resiliency, modernizing existing infrastructure and participation in transmission projects through FERC s  open window  solicitation process.  
     We continue to actively explore opportunities in the retail energy marketing business, which we believe would complement our existing wholesale marketing business. Our entry into the retail energy marketing business is subject to market conditions and regulatory approval, among other things.

There can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully develop and execute any of the strategic options noted above, or any additional options we may consider in the future. The execution of any such strategic plan may not have the expected benefits or may have unexpected adverse consequences. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  PSEG 
  Our results of operations are primarily comprised of the results of operations of our principal operating subsidiaries, PSE G and Power, excluding charges related to intercompany transactions, which are eliminated in consolidation. For additional information on intercompany transactions, see Item 1.   Note 18. Related-Party Transactions  .  

The following discussions for PSE G and Power provide a detailed explanation of their respective variances.  
   
  PSE G  

Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   as Compared to   2015    
  Operating Revenues     decreased     $82 million   due to changes in delivery, commodity, clause and other operating revenues.  
  Delivery Revenues     increased     $57 million   due primarily to an increase in transmission revenues.    
             
    Transmission revenues were   $50 million     higher   due to increased capital investments. 
                
    Electric distribution revenues   increased     $8 million   due primarily to   $12 million   in   higher sales volumes   and   $12 million   due to the inclusion of Energy Strong in base rates, partially offset by   lower   Green Program Recovery Charges (GPRC) of   $16 million  .

Table of Contents  

Commodity Revenue     decreased     $19 million   as a result of   $14 million   of lower Gas revenues and   $5 million   of lower Electric revenues. Commodity revenue for both gas and electric is entirely offset with the change in Energy Costs. PSE G earns no margin on the provision of BGSS and BGS to retail customers.  
             
    Gas revenues   decreased     $14 million   due to   $25 million   of   lower   BGSS sales volumes, partially offset by   $11 million   in higher prices. 
                
    Electric revenues   decreased     $5 million   due primarily to   $17 million   of   lower revenues   from collections of Non-Utility Generation Charges (NGC) and a decrease of   $14 million   due to lower volumes of Non-Utility Generation (NUG) energy sold at lower prices. These decreases were partially offset by a   $26 million   increase in BGS revenues due to   higher sales volumes  .  
     Clause Revenues     decreased     $121 million   due primarily to   lower   Securitization Transition Charges (STC) of   $118 million  . The STC reduction was a result of rate reductions due to the completion of securitization collections in 2015. The changes in the STC amounts are entirely offset by decreases in the amortization of Regulatory Assets and related costs in O M, Depreciation and Amortization and Interest Expense. PSE G does not earn margin on STC collections.   
  Operating Expenses 
  Energy Costs     decreased     $19 million  . This is entirely offset by the change in Commodity Revenue.  
  Operation and Maintenance     decreased     $15 million  , of which the most significant components were 
             
    a   $23 million   net reduction in costs related to various clause mechanisms, including SBC and STC, and GPRC, and 
                
    a   $2 million     decrease     in pension and OPEB costs, net of capitalized amounts, 
                
    partially offset by a net   increase   of   $10 million   in operating expenses, including increases in appliance service costs, gas distribution costs and electric distribution corrective maintenance. 
     Depreciation and Amortization     decreased     $94 million   due to a   decrease   of   $114 million   in amortization of Regulatory Assets primarily as a result of the completion of the amortization of the securitization charges in 2015 (which is completely offset in STC Revenues), partially offset by an   $18 million     increase   in depreciation due to additional plant in service. 
  Interest Expense     increased     $5 million   due primarily to   an increase   of   $7 million   due to net debt issuances in 2015 and 2016, partially offset by a   $2 million   decrease due to the redemption of securitization debt in 2015. 
  Income Tax Expense     increased     $7 million   due primarily to higher pre-tax income, partially offset by plant-related items and uncertain tax positions.  
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   as Compared to   2015    
  Operating Revenues     decreased     $488 million   due to changes in delivery, commodity, clause and other operating revenues.  
  Delivery Revenues     increased     $116 million   due primarily to an increase in transmission revenues.    
             
    Transmission revenues were   $152 million     higher   due to increased capital investments. 
                
    Electric distribution revenues   decreased     $30 million   due primarily to   lower   GPRC of   $42 million   and a   $4 million   decrease due to   lower sales volumes   partially offset by   $16 million   increase due to the inclusion of Energy Strong in base rates. 
                
    Gas distribution revenues   decreased     $6 million   due primarily to   $75 million   of   lower   delivery volumes and   lower   GPRC of   $7 million   due to lower sales volumes from warmer winter weather. These decreases were almost entirely offset by   $64 million   in   higher   Weather Normalization Clause revenue and a   $12 million   increase due to the inclusion of Energy Strong in base rates effective September 1, 2015. 
     Commodity Revenue     decreased     $197 million   as a result of lower Gas and Electric revenues. Commodity revenue for both gas and electric is entirely offset with decreased Energy Costs. PSE G earns no margin on the provision of BGSS and BGS to retail customers. 
             
    Gas revenues   decreased     $108 million   due primarily to   lower   BGSS sales volumes. 
                
    Electric revenues   decreased     $89 million   due primarily to   $43 million   of   lower revenues   from collections of NGC, a decrease of   $31 million   due to lower volumes of NUG energy sold and a   $15 million   or   1%   decrease in BGS revenues due primarily to   lower sales volumes  .

Clause Revenues     decreased     $402 million   due primarily to   lower   STC of   $370 million  ,   lower   SBC of   $38 million   and   $9 million   of lower SPRC, partially offset by   higher   Margin Adjustment Clause (MAC) revenue of   $15 million  . The STC reduction is a result of rate reductions due to the completion of securitization collections in 2015. The changes in the STC, SBC, SPRC and MAC amounts are entirely offset by decreases in the amortization of Regulatory Assets and related costs in O M, Depreciation and Amortization and Interest Expense. PSE G does not earn margin on STC, SBC, SPRC or MAC collections.   
  Operating Expenses 
  Energy Costs     decreased     $197 million  . This is entirely offset by the change in Commodity Revenue.  
  Operation and Maintenance     decreased     $61 million  , of which the most significant components were 
             
    a   $95 million   net reduction in costs related to various clause mechanisms, including SBC, SPRC, STC and MAC, and GPRC, and 
                
    a   $10 million   decrease in pension and OPEB costs, net of capitalized amounts, 
                
    partially offset by   $10 million   of storm insurance recovery proceeds received in 2015,

    partially offset by a net decrease of $75 million related to our fossil plants, largely due to higher costs incurred in 2015 for our planned major outages at the Bethlehem Energy Center and Bergen generating plants, and 
                
    a net decrease of $58 million related to our nuclear plants due primarily to a planned outage at our 100%-owned Hope Creek plant and our 50%-owned Peach Bottom plant in 2015, partly offset in 2016 by an extended refueling outage at our 57%-owned Salem Unit 1 plant. 
     Depreciation and Amortization   increased     $19 million     due primarily to   
             
    a $12 million increase due primarily to a higher nuclear asset base,  
                
    $4 million of accelerated depreciation on asset retirement costs from previously retired assets at the Hudson and Mercer plants, and  
                
    $3 million of higher depreciation due to new solar projects. 
     Other Income (Deductions)   decreased     $36 million   due primarily to $28 million of insurance recoveries received in 2015 related to Superstorm Sandy and lower net realized gains from the NDT Fund in 2016. 
  Other-Than-Temporary Impairments     decreased     $20 million   due to lower impairments of equity securities in the NDT Fund in 2016. 
  Interest Expense     decreased     $28 million   due primarily to higher capitalized interest in 2016 and the maturity of $300 million of 5.50% Senior Notes in December 2015, partially offset by the issuance of $700 million of 3.00% Senior Notes in June 2016. 
  Income Tax Expense     decreased     $237 million   in 2016 due primarily to lower pre-tax income. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  The following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis, noting the uses and contributions, where material, of our two direct major operating subsidiaries. 
  Operating Cash Flows  
  We expect operating cash flows combined with cash on hand and financing activities to be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures and shareholder dividend payments. 
  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , our operating cash flow   decreased     $467 million   as compared to the same period in   2015  . The net change was due primarily to the net changes from PSE G and Power as discussed below. 
  PSE G  
  PSE G s operating cash flow   decreased     $117 million   from   $1,518 million   to   $1,401 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , due primarily to a   decrease   of   $113 million   due to a change in regulatory deferrals, a   $64 million     decrease   due to higher vendor payments and a decrease due to the completion of securitization collections in 2015. These amounts were partially offset by   higher earnings   and higher tax refunds in 2016.  
  Power 
  Power s operating cash flow   decreased     $298 million   from   $1,558 million   to   $1,260 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to   lower earnings  , a   $140 million     decrease   from fuels, materials and supplies, and a   $146 million     increase   in margin deposit requirements, partially offset by a reduction in tax payments.

Short-Term Liquidity 
  PSEG meets its short-term liquidity requirements, as well as those of Power, primarily with cash and through the issuance of commercial paper. PSE G maintains its own separate commercial paper program to meet its short-term liquidity requirements. Each commercial paper program is fully back-stopped by its own separate credit facilities. 
  We continually monitor our liquidity and seek to add capacity as needed to meet our liquidity requirements. Each of our credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below; however, if necessary, the PSEG facilities can also be used to support our subsidiaries  liquidity needs. Our total credit facilities and available liquidity as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

As of September 30, 2016  , our credit facility capacity was in excess of our projected maximum liquidity requirements over our 12 month planning horizon. Our maximum liquidity requirements are based on stress scenarios that incorporate changes in commodity prices and the     potential impact of Power losing its investment grade credit rating, which would represent a three level downgrade from its current S P and Moody s ratings. In the even  t of a deterioration of Power s credit rating certain of Power s agreements allow the counterparty to demand further performance assurance. The potential additional collateral that we would be required to post under these agreements if Power were to lose its investment grade credit rating was approximately   $807 million   and   $864 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The early retirement of Power s Hudson and Mercer coal/gas generation units is not expected to have a material impact on Power s debt covenant ratios or its ability to obtain credit facilities. See Item 1.   Note 3. Early Plant Retirements  .   
  As of September 30, 2016  ,   PSEG s credit facilities are primarily available to back-stop its Commercial Paper Program under which PSEG had   $255 million   outstanding. PSE G s credit facility primary use is to support its Commercial Paper Program under which as of   September 30, 2016  ,   no amounts   were outstanding. Most of our credit facilities expire in 2019 and 2020.  
  For additional information, see Item 1.  Note 10. Debt and Credit Facilities  . 
  Long-Term Debt Financing 
  For a discussion of our long-term debt transactions during   2016  , see Item 1.   Note 10. Debt and Credit Facilities  . 
  Common Stock Dividends 
  On   July 19, 2016  , our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of   $0.41   per share of common stock for the third quarter of 2016. This reflects an indicative annual dividend rate of   $1.64   per share. We expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, alternate investment opportunities, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. For additional information related to cash dividends on our common stock, see Item 1.   Note 16. Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Dividends  . 
  Credit Ratings 
  If the rating agencies lower or withdraw our credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of our securities and serve to materially increase our cost of capital and limit access to capital. Credit Ratings shown are for securities that we typically issue. Outlooks are shown for Corporate Credit Ratings (S P) and Issuer Credit Ratings (Moody s) and can be Stable, Negative, or Positive. There is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments, circumstances warrant. Each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies  ratings. The ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.   
  In January 2016, S P published updated research reports on PSEG and PSE G and the existing ratings and outlooks were unchanged. In June 2016, Moody s published credit opinions on Power and PSE G and the existing ratings and outlooks were

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
  We expect that all of our capital requirements over the next three years will come from a combination of internally generated funds and external debt financing. There were no material changes to our projected capital expenditures at Power and Services as compared to amounts disclosed in our   2015   Form 10-K.  
  PSEG 
  In July 2016, PSEG partnered with Vectren Corporation on a FERC 1000 proposal to construct, own and operate a twenty mile, 345 kilovolt transmission line in the midwest region served by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). MISO estimated the project would cost approximately $60 million and would go in service in 2021. MISO is expected to select a proposal in December 2016. This project is not included in PSEG s projected capital expenditures.     
  PSE G 
  PSE G increased its estimate of its capital expenditure program as reported in our 2015 Form 10-K by approximately $300 million from $8.3 billion to $8.6 billion primarily to address new business requests and replace aging equipment and infrastructure.    
  In August 2016, PSE G filed a petition with the BPU requesting approval of the $268 million investment and an associated cost recovery mechanism to develop a project where PSE G would rebuild New Jersey Transit s Mason substation and related facilities in Kearny, NJ. This is not included in PSE G s projected capital expenditures.  
  On October 20, 2016, PSE G submitted a settlement agreement to the BPU providing for an extension of the existing landfill/brownfield solar program to construct up to 33 MW of grid connected facilities with projected capital expenditures of approximately $80 million through May 2020. This extension is pending approval by the BPU. This is not included in PSE G s projected capital expenditures.  
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , PSE G made capital expenditures of   $2,035 million  , primarily for transmission and distribution system reliability. This does not include expenditures for cost of removal, net of salvage, of   $109 million  , which are included in operating cash flows. 
  Power 
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , Power made capital expenditures of   $767 million  , excluding   $156 million   for nuclear fuel, primarily related to our Keys, Sewaren 7, BH5 and other generation projects.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS 
  For information related to recent accounting matters, see Item 1.   Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards  . 

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     The risk inherent in our market-risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices, equity security prices and interest rates as discussed in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. It is our policy to use derivatives to manage risk consistent with business plans and prudent practices. We have a Risk Management Committee comprised of executive officers who utilize a risk oversight function to ensure compliance with our corporate policies and risk management practices. 
  Additionally, we are exposed to counterparty credit losses in the event of non-performance or non-payment. We have a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure. In the event of non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. 
  Commodity Contracts 
  The availability and price of energy-related commodities are subject to fluctuations from factors such as weather, environmental policies, changes in supply and demand, state and federal regulatory policies, market rules and other events. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, we enter into supply contracts and derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options with approved counterparties. These contracts, in conjunction with physical sales and other services, help reduce risk and optimize the value of owned electric generation capacity. 
  Value-at-Risk (VaR) Models 
  VaR represents the potential losses, under normal market conditions, for instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. We estimate VaR across our commodity businesses. 
  MTM VaR consists of MTM derivatives that are economic hedges, some of which qualify for hedge accounting. The MTM VaR calculation does not include market risks associated with activities that are subject to accrual accounting, primarily our generating facilities and some load serving activities.  
  The VaR models used are variance/covariance models adjusted for the change of positions with   95%   and   99.5%   confidence levels and a one-day holding period for the MTM activities. The models assume no new positions throughout the holding periods; however, we actively manage our portfolio. 
  From July through September 2016,     MTM VaR remained relatively stable between low of   $11 million   to high of   $16 million   at   95%   confidence level. The range of VaR was narrower for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
  We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported and is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of each respective company, as appropriate, by others within the entities to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We have established a disclosure committee which includes several key management employees and which reports directly to the CFO and CEO of each of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated, Public Service Electric and Gas Company and PSEG Power LLC. The committee monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of these disclosure controls and procedures. The CFO and CEO of each of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated, Public Service Electric and Gas Company and PSEG Power LLC have evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures and, based on this evaluation, have concluded that disclosure controls and procedures at each respective company were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by the report. 
  Internal Controls 
  There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   third   quarter of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, each registrant s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     We are party to various lawsuits and regulatory matters in the ordinary course of business. For additional information regarding material legal proceedings, including updates to information reported in Item 3 of Part I of the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, see Part I, Item 1.   Note 9. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities   and Item 5. Other Information. 
  Ewing Explosion 
  In February 2014, pursuant to an existing contract, PSE G assigned Henkels and McCoy (Henkels) to replace the electrical service at a home in the South Fork Townhouse Community in Ewing Township, Mercer County, New Jersey. In March 2014, after Henkels began work to install new electric service, a gas explosion occurred in the townhouse community resulting in damage to numerous properties, personal injuries and one fatality. 
  Twenty-two lawsuits have been filed to date relating to the gas explosion, of which PSE G was named as a defendant in nineteen cases. To date, six of these cases have resolved through private negotiations and/or mediation. In one of the remaining pending matters, plaintiffs representing the estate of the decedent are seeking damages under the New Jersey Wrongful Death Act and the New Jersey Survivors Act as well as punitive damages. PSE G has denied all allegations of liability. We intend to continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits. At this stage of the litigation, we are unable to determine or predict the ultimate outcome of any of the remaining lawsuits. 

ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS

ITEM 5.     OTHER INFORMATION 
  Certain information reported in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K is updated below. Additionally, certain information is provided for new matters that have arisen subsequent to the filing of the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended   March 31, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  . References are to the related pages on the Forms 10-K and 10-Q as printed and distributed. 
  Federal Regulation 
  FERC 
  Capacity Market Issues-PJM 
  December 31, 2015 Form 10-K page 17, March 31, 2016 Form 10-Q page 70 and June 30, 2016 Form 10-Q page 80.   Over the past several years, certain entities in PJM, namely, FirstEnergy Corp. (FE) and American Electric Power (AEP) have been looking to the Ohio Public Utility Commission (PUCO) to provide financial support arrangements for their coal plants and a nuclear plant (FE). FE and AEP originally proposed to enter into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with their non-utility generation affiliates providing for above-market purchases from certain coal plants and a nuclear plant (in FE's case). The PUCO Staff proposed a payment to support modernization of the distribution system (distribution modernization rider) in the FE case which was ultimately accepted by the PUCO. The Dayton Power and Light Company also recently filed for a distribution modernization rider for the generating plants that it owns.   
  The PUCO proceedings created a concern that subsidized units within the PJM footprint would submit bids in the capacity market that are not reflective of their actual operating costs and would, in turn, artificially suppress capacity prices. As a result, certain parties requested that FERC should direct PJM to expand the  minimum offer price rule  to apply to existing units.    
  We are unable to predict the results of these pending proceedings or any future related proceedings or to calculate the potential impacts on our business. 
     Transmission Regulation 
  December 31, 2015 Form 10-K page 19 and June 30, 2016 Form 10-Q page 80.   In October 2016,     PSE G filed its 2017 Annual Formula Rate Update with FERC which requests approximately   $121 million   in increased annual transmission revenues effective January 1, 2017, subject to true-up. For additional information about our transmission formula rate, see Part 1, Item 1. Financial Information   Note 5. Recent Rate Filings  .  
  Transmission Regulation     Transmission Policy Developments 
  December 31, 2015 Form 10-K page 19, March 31, 2016 Form 10-Q page 71 and June 30, 2016 Form 10-Q page 80.   FERC concluded in Order 1000 that the incumbent transmission owner should not always have a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) to construct and own transmission projects in its service territory. We and other companies appealed various aspects of the FERC order approving PJM s implementation of Order 1000, including the elimination of the ROFR from the PJM Tariff. In July 2016, the D.C. Court dismissed the case, thus upholding FERC s determination. We have decided not to pursue further action on this decision. 
  In April 2016, PSE G accepted construction responsibility for the three components of the transmission project involving upgrades at Artificial Island in New Jersey. On August 5, 2016, PJM announced that it has suspended the Artificial Island transmission project and is performing a comprehensive analysis to determine a future course of action, which is expected to be completed by February 2017.   
  
   84 

Table of Contents  

In August 2016, FERC issued an order to PJM and the PJM Transmission Owners with respect to their compliance with a previous FERC order (Order 890) that requires transparency in the transmission planning process. The order directs PJM and PJM Transmission Owners to propose revisions to the PJM governing documents to ensure compliance with Order 890 or show cause why they should not do so. The PJM Transmission Owners jointly filed for rehearing of the order to show cause and jointly responded to FERC s directives. FERC is also evaluating issues related to competitive transmission development processes, including the use of cost containment provisions. PSE G has argued against the use of cost caps in the assessment of Order 1000 open window project bids. We are unable to predict at this time the results of these proceedings and the impact they will have on our business.   
  State Regulation  
  Solar 4 All Program Extension II 
  On October 20, 2016, PSE G submitted a settlement agreement to the BPU providing for an extension of the existing landfill/brownfield solar program to construct up to 33 MW of grid connected facilities with projected capital expenditures of approximately $80 million through May 2020. This matter is pending approval by the BPU. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
  Air Pollution Control 
  Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)     
  December 31, 2015 Form 10-K page 24.   In September 2016, the EPA published the final CSAPR Updating Rule to address the 2008 National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground-level ozone. The rule establishes more stringent annual ozone season (May 1 through September 30) caps beginning in May 2017. We do not anticipate any material impact on our business or financial condition due to the CSAPR.
