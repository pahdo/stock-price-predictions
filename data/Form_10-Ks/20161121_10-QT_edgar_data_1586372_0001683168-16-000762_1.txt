Statements 

 September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015 

NOTE 1   CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

The accompanying
financial statements of Dthera Sciences (the  Company ) have been prepared by the Company without audit. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2016, and for all periods presented herein, have been made. 

Certain information
and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that
these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's
December 31, 2015 audited financial statements. The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years. 

NOTE 2  
GOING CONCERN  

The Company's
financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and
liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of the date of this Report, the Company had an accumulated deficit
of $1,440,008, negative working capital of $240,620, and no revenues to cover its operating costs, which raises substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. As of the date of this Report, the Company had not yet established an ongoing
source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. 

The future of
the Company as an operating business will depend on its ability to (1) obtain sufficient capital contributions and/or financing
as may be required to sustain its operations and (2) to achieve adequate revenues from its operations. Management's plan to address
these issues includes, (a) continued exercise of tight cost controls to conserve cash, (b) obtaining additional financing, (c)
placing revenue producing services into place (d) identifying and executing on additional revenue generating opportunities. 

The ability of
the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the
preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. If the
Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. 

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Nature of Business    Dthera
Sciences (formerly Knowledge Machine International, Inc.) is a Nevada corporation, and was incorporated on December 12, 2013. 

The Company offers a subscription-based
service that captures, shares, and stores photos and audio in cloud. It offers the EveryStory platform, which enables users to
preserve and share memories, and will initially target a Quality of Life benefit in certain patient populations, principally patients
suffering from Alzheimer s disease and dementia. On September 21, 2016, the Company acquired a new operating subsidiary,
EveryStory, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( EveryStory ). Following the acquisition (referred to herein as the  EveryStory
Transaction ), the Company s business is to develop a Digital Therapeutic technology designed to deliver Reminiscence
Therapy to certain patient populations, principally patients suffering from Alzheimer s disease and dementia with the goal
of a Quality of Life benefit and reduction in anxiety in those populations. As of the date of this Report, EveryStory was our only
subsidiary. In connection with the EveryStory transaction, the Company dissolved its other former subsidiary entity and terminated
its prior business operations. 

Acquisition of
EveryStory; EveryStory Transaction 

On September 21, 2016, the Company entered
into an Amended and Restated Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement (the  A R Agreement ) with EveryStory, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ( EveryStory ), and each of its shareholder (the  Shareholders ), and closed the
acquisition (the  Acquisition ) of the ownership of EveryStory (the  Closing ). 

The Company acquired all of the outstanding
shares of EveryStory, and agreed to issue an aggregate of 77,377,712 shares of the Company s common stock to the EveryStory
holders, with the understanding that an additional 45,247,288 shares were to be reserved for issuance to holders of EveryStory
derivative securities which are convertible or exercisable into shares of EveryStory common stock (collectively, the  Exchange
Shares ). Additionally, prior to Closing, the parties agreed that certain shares of the Company s common stock were
to be returned to the Company for cancellation, resulting in the current Company s shareholders owning an aggregate of 40,875,000
shares of the Company s common stock immediately prior to the Closing. 

Pursuant to the A R Agreement, the
122,625,000 Exchange Shares issued or to be issued to the EveryStory constituted 75% of the total issued and outstanding shares
of the Company s common stock, and the legacy Company shareholders (who were the owners of the Company s common stock
immediately prior to the Closing) owned an aggregate of 40,875,000 shares, which constituted 25% of the total outstanding Company
common stock. 

The Company s and EveryStory s
management agreed, and the A R Agreement provides, that following the Closing, the Company will conduct a reverse stock split
(discussed in more detail below), following which the outstanding shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock will convert
into a total of 8,000,000 post-reverse-split common stock. Following such conversion, the EveryStory owners will own or have the
right to receive shares of the Company s common stock equal to 60% of the then-outstanding Company common stock, and the
Company legacy shareholders will own shares of the Company s common stock equal to 40% of the then-outstanding Company common
stock, consisting of 8,000,000 shares of Company common stock issued on conversion of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock
(20%) and 8,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock owned by the other legacy Company shareholders (20%). 

As a result of the Closing of the A R
Agreement, EveryStory became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Additionally, the directors and officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Closing appointed the EveryStory management to become officers and directors of the Company, and then
resigned from their positions with the Company. In addition, the Company terminated its pre-Closing business operations and agreed
to dissolve its other wholly owned subsidiary, Knowledge Machine, Inc. 

Immediately prior to the Closing, there
were 40,875,000 shares of the Company s common stock. In connection with the Closing, the Company issued an aggregate of
77,377,712 shares to the EveryStory shareholders, and 45,247,288 shares were reserved for issuance to the holders of EveryStory
options and convertible debt instruments, and the parties to the A R Agreement understand and anticipate that all such holders
would exercise and convert their securities into the reserved shares of the Company. 

On November 2, 2016, a reverse stock split
(the  Reverse Split ) of the Company s common stock took effect. The ratio of the Reverse Split was 1:5.109375,
meaning one new share for each 5.109375 old shares of the Company s common stock. All share numbers provided in this Quarterly
Report are given on a post-reverse-split basis. 

Accounting Basis  

The Company s
financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP.   As disclosed
in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed November 17, 2016, the Company recently changed to a December 31 fiscal year end. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates are made in relation to the
allowance for doubtful accounts and the fair value of certain financial instruments. 

Principles of Consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Dthera Sciences and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-Company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company measures assets and liabilities
at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents
the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction
between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset
or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value
on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. 

The following are the hierarchical levels
of inputs to measure fair value: 

Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2 - Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.   

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company's assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.   

The carrying amounts of the Company's financial
assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable   accrued expenses, certain
notes payable and notes payable - related party, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

The Company accounts for its derivative
liabilities, at fair value, on a recurring basis under level 2. 

Embedded Conversion Features  

The Company evaluates embedded conversion
features within convertible debt under Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 815,  Derivatives and Hedging 
to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative
at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment
under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20  Debt with Conversion and Other Options  for consideration
of any beneficial conversion feature. 

Derivative Financial Instruments  

The Company does not use derivative instruments
to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of it financial instruments, including
stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at
its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. 

For option-based simple derivative financial
instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent
valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities
or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. 

Debt Issue Costs and Debt Discount  

The Company may record debt issue costs
and/or debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt. These costs may be paid in the form of cash,
or equity (such as warrants). These costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying
debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company accounts for share based payments
in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award.
In accordance with ASC 718-10-30-9, Measurement Objective   Fair Value at Grant Date, the Company estimates the fair value
of the award using a valuation technique. For this purpose, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company
believes this model provides the best estimate of fair value due to its ability to incorporate inputs that change over time, such
as volatility and interest rates, and to allow for actual exercise behavior of option holders. 

Compensation cost is recognized over the
requisite service period which is generally equal to the vesting period. Upon exercise, shares issued will be newly issued shares
from authorized common stock. 

ASC 505,  Compensation-Stock Compensation ,
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments to non-employees
for goods or services. Under this transition method, stock compensation expense includes compensation expense for all stock-based
compensation awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions
of ASC 505. 

Loss Per Share  

Basic loss per
Common Share is computed by dividing losses attributable to Common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding during the period. 

Diluted loss per
Common Share is computed by dividing loss attributable to Common shareholders by the weighted-average number of Shares of Common
Stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional Shares of Common Stock that would have been outstanding
if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding convertible Preferred
Stock, stock options, warrants, and convertible debt. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted
earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market
value of the Company s Common Stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. 

For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, all of the Company s potentially dilutive securities (warrants, options,
convertible preferred stock, and convertible debt) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as they
were anti-dilutive. The total number of potentially dilutive Common Shares that were excluded were 240,886 and 0 at nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Management has
considered all other recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our consolidated financial statements. The
Company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated
financial statements. 

NOTE 4   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  

The Company s
property and equipment were comprised of the following as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015: 

NOTE 5   ASSET ACQUISITION  

On June 5, 2016, EveryStory  issued  88,000
pre-split/614,340 post-split new shares for the purchase agreement for an SIT Patent at $0.67 per share for a value of
$58,960. The price per share for Common Stock issued was based on the relative fair market value of the Common Stock
using the backsolve valuation method. 

The Company evaluated this acquisition
in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (10-55-4) to discern whether the assets and operations of SIT met the definition
of a business. The Company concluded there were not a sufficient number of key processes obtained to develop the inputs into outputs,
nor could such processes be easily obtained by the Company. Accordingly, the Company accounted for this transaction as the acquisition
of assets. 

The transaction was accounted for in accordance
with asset acquisition guidance found in ASC 805. The consideration transferred and assets acquired recognized is as follows:

On September 13, 2016, the Company conducted

in the Company following the Closing of the EveryStory Transaction. In the convertible note offering, the Company raised an aggregate
of $240,000, which will be a component of the post-Closing capitalization of the Company. In the Note Offering, investors entered
into a securities purchase agreement (the   Note SPA  ) and were issued a convertible redeemable promissory note
(collectively, the   Convertible Notes  ). Pursuant to the terms of the Note SPA, each investor represented and
warranted that it was an accredited investor and that he or she was purchasing the Convertible Notes for his or her own account,
and not with a view to distribution, as well as other standard representations made in private transactions. Also pursuant to the
Note SPA, the Company has the right to put an additional Convertible Note (in the same principal amount as purchased by the applicable
investor) beginning on January 3, 2017, subject to certain conditions. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 10%, and
mature on September 13, 2017, if not converted or prepaid prior to that. The Convertible Notes convert into shares of the Company's
common stock at a price for each share of Common Stock equal to 65% of the lowest closing bid price of the Common Stock as reported
on the OTC Market platform on which the Company s shares are quoted or any exchange upon which the Common Stock may be traded
in the future ( Exchange ), on the date of the closing of the EveryStory Transaction. Up to 50% of the Convertible Notes
may be repaid by the Company any time prior to 180 days after the issuance of the Convertible Notes, with a 30% premium to be paid
in connection with the prepayment. 

On September 21, 2016 as part of the

into 566,503 pre-split/3,954,836 post-split shares of the Company s common stock. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, conversions of convertible notes into common stock totaled $625,000 and interest totaling $63,713, converted into 635,033
pre-split/4,433,255 post-split shares of the Company s common stock. 

NOTE 8  DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES  

Determining which
category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures
each quarter. The Company has four liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which consists of a derivative liability
on certain convertible notes payable (see note 7). As of September 30, 2016 this derivative liability had an estimated fair value
of $191,949. The Company has no assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

The following
table presents information about our derivative liability, which was our only financial instrument measured at fair value on a
recurring basis using significant inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable (Level 2)
as of  September 30, 2016: 

The fair value
of this derivative liability was calculated using the multinomial lattice models that value the derivative liability within the
notes based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. These models are based on future projections of the various potential
outcomes. The features in the notes that were analyzed and incorporated into the model included the conversion feature with the
reset provisions; redemption provisions; and the default provisions. Assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the derivative
liability were as follows: 

In addition to the assumptions above, the Company also takes into consideration whether or not the Company would participate in
another round of financing and if that financing is registered or not and what that stock price would be for the financing at that
time. The Company notes that the notes have matured and is no longer calculating a derivative value for these notes.

management reviewed all material events through the date of this filing and determined that there were the following material subsequent
events to report: 

Reverse Stock Split; Conversion of Outstanding
Knowledge Machine Series A Preferred Stock  

On November 2, 2016, a reverse stock split
(the  Reverse Split ) of the Company s common stock took effect. The ratio of the Reverse Split was 1:5.109375,
meaning one new share for each 5.109375 old shares of the Company s common stock. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, the
Company s transfer agent was instructed to round up to the nearest whole share. 

Immediately following the effectiveness
of the Reverse Split, the Company s 100,000 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted, pursuant to their
terms, into 8,000,000 shares of post-Reverse Split common stock. Additionally, through the application of the Reverse Split, the
40,875,000 shares of common stock held by the legacy shareholders of Knowledge Machine following the closing of the EveryStory
Transaction and immediately prior to the Reverse Split became 8,000,000 shares of common stock. Accordingly, the legacy shareholders
of Knowledge Machine International, including the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, owned an aggregate of 16,000,000
shares of the Company s common stock. The shares of the Company s common stock held by the former EveryStory Shareholders
went from 77,377,712 to 15,144,262 shares by virtue of the Reverse Split, with an additional 8,855,738 shares of the Company s
common stock reserved for issuance to the holders of EveryStory convertible instruments, including convertible notes, options,
and other derivative securities. 

Following the Reverse Split, the Company
had 35,853,007 shares of common stock outstanding, consisting of 27,853,007 shares outstanding resulting from the Reverse Split,
and the 8,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock issued on conversion of the prior KMI Series A Preferred Stock immediately
following the Reverse Split. 

The Reverse Split was approved by the Board
of Directors and the shareholders of the Company prior to the closing of the EveryStory Transaction, which approval was included
in the closing conditions to the EveryStory Transaction. 

Name Change; Ticker Symbol Change Requested  

In connection with the closing of the EveryStory
Transaction and the divestiture of the prior business and operations of the Company, as well as the new focus of the Company on
the digital therapeutics and reminiscence therapy focus of the Company, the Board of Directors and the majority shareholders of
the Company immediately following the closing of the EveryStory Transaction approved an amendment to the Company s Articles
of Incorporation to change the name of the Company (the  Name Change ) from Knowledge Machine International, Inc.,
to Dthera Sciences. The Name Change took effect at the same time as the Reverse Split on November 2, 2016. 

In connection with the Name Change, and
to help current shareholders and new investors better understand the business of the Company, the Company requested that a new
ticker symbol be assigned to the Company. The Company has requested  DTHR  as the new ticker symbol, which will take
effect twenty business days following the effectiveness of the Reverse Split (per FINRA rules).

Overview  

On September 21,
2016, the Company acquired a new operating subsidiary, EveryStory, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( EveryStory ). EveryStory
offers a subscription-based service that captures, shares, and stores photos and audio in cloud. It offers the EveryStory platform,
which enables users to preserve and share memories, and will initially target a Quality of Life benefit in certain patient populations,
principally patients suffering from Alzheimer s disease and dementia. As of the date of this Report, EveryStory was our only
subsidiary. Additional information relating to the business and operations of EveryStory, which will become our business and operations,
is given below. Prior to the closing of the transaction with EveryStory (the  EveryStory Transaction ), the Company
had been incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 27, 2012, to engage in the development and operation of a business engaged
in the distribution of high end edged tools produced outside the US. The Company conducted this business through October 22, 2014.
On October 22, 2014, the Company acquired an operating subsidiary, Knowledge Machine, Inc., a Nevada corporation, ( Knowledge
Machine ), which focused on new technologies, acquiring licensing rights to those technologies, and marketing the licensed
technologies, and the Company sold off the edged tools business. In connection with the EveryStory Transaction, the Company dissolved
Knowledge Machine, and terminated the technology licensing and marketing operations. 

Subsequent to
the closing of the EveryStory Transaction, the Company effectuated a reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock, changed
its name from Knowledge Machine International to Dthera Sciences, and requested a new ticker symbol, which should take effect in
late November 2016. Additional information about these events is included below under the heading  Recent Developments.  

Our principal
offices are located at 7310 Miramar Rd., San Diego, CA 92126, and our mailing address is 9921 Carmel Mountain Road, Suite 118,
San Diego, CA 92129. 

The Company qualifies
as an  emerging growth company  as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the  JOBS Act ). 

Plan of Operations  

By way of background, EveryStory, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation, was founded on September 5, 2013. From inception until EveryStory formally launched operations in January
2014, EveryStory was a development stage company. Following the closing of the EveryStory Transaction, EveryStory became a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, which divested itself of its former business and operations, and will focus on the business and
operations of Digital Therapeutics and Reminiscence Therapy using the EveryStory Platform going forward. References herein to  EveryStory 
relate to the wholly owned Delaware corporation subsidiary. References to the  Company,  or  we,   our, 
or  us,  refer to the publicly reporting company, Dthera Sciences, formerly Knowledge Machine International, Inc.,
with the understanding that Dthera Sciences will be implementing the business, operations, and plans of EveryStory. 

Overview   The Platform  

EveryStory began as a digital image story-sharing
platform (the  Platform ) that allowed users to collaboratively create, preserve and share personal stories within
a private group. 

David Keene is the Chief Technical Officer
and Founder of EveryStory. In his words:  I created EveryStory after being diagnosed with colon cancer and realizing my son
might never remember my voice or hear my stories. I am passionate about providing people with an innovative way to preserve and
share memories forever in the most interactive way possible.  Mr. Keene was successfully treated in 2012, and is now healthy
and cancer-free. 

Key components of the Platform include
the ability to record audio narratives that are linked to specific photos and which can be played when the photos are viewed; the
ability to import photos directly from computers or mobile devices; cloud-based data storage of the photos and the audio recordings;
and multiple playback capabilities; collaborative creation and sharing of stories. The Platform was designed for mobile device
platforms to enable users to record and store photos and audio easily and conveniently. 

Application of the Platform  
Digital Therapeutics and Reminiscence Therapy  

Dthera s management is focused on
the goal of using EveryStory s technology Platform, which streamlines the creation of personalized digital stories, to become
the first clinically-proven Digital Therapeutic delivering Reminiscence Therapy to patients with Alzheimer's disease and Dementia.
EveryStory already has a granted US patent (issued in 2010) that broadly covers the use of EveryStory s technology in Senior
Living facilities. EveryStory recently commenced a clinical trial with the University of California at
San Diego ( UCSD ) showing that EveryStory is an effective anxiety reduction and quality of life therapy for those
with Alzheimer s disease or Dementia ( ADOD ). 

In connection with this application of
the Platform, EveryStory is focusing on the developing fields of Digital Therapeutics and Reminiscence Therapy.

Recent Developments  

Reverse Stock Split; Conversion of Outstanding
Knowledge Machine Series A Preferred Stock  

On November 2, 2016, a reverse stock split
(the  Reverse Split ) of the Company s common stock took effect. The ratio of the Reverse Split was 1:5.109375,
meaning one new share for each 5.109375 old shares of the Company s common stock. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, the
Company s transfer agent was instructed to round up to the nearest whole share. 

Immediately following the effectiveness
of the Reverse Split, the Company s 100,000 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted, pursuant to their
terms, into 8,000,000 shares of post-Reverse Split common stock. Additionally, through the application of the Reverse Split, the
40,875,000 shares of common stock held by the legacy shareholders of Knowledge Machine following the closing of the EveryStory
Transaction and immediately prior to the Reverse Split became 8,000,000 shares of common stock. Accordingly, the legacy shareholders
of Knowledge Machine International, including the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, owned an aggregate of 16,000,000
shares of the Company s common stock. The shares of the Company s common stock held by the former EveryStory Shareholders
went from 77,377,712 to 15,144,262 shares by virtue of the Reverse Split, with an additional 8,855,738 shares of the Company s
common stock reserved for issuance to the holders of EveryStory convertible instruments, including convertible notes, options,
and other derivative securities. 

Following the Reverse Split, the Company
had 35,853,007 shares of common stock outstanding, consisting of 27,853,007 shares outstanding resulting from the Reverse Split,
and the 8,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock issued on conversion of the prior KMI Series A Preferred Stock immediately
following the Reverse Split. 

The Reverse Split was approved by the Board
of Directors and the shareholders of the Company prior to the closing of the EveryStory Transaction, which approval was included
in the closing conditions to the EveryStory Transaction. 

Name Change; Ticker Symbol Change Requested  

In connection with the closing of the EveryStory
Transaction and the divestiture of the prior business and operations of the Company, as well as the new focus of the Company on
the digital therapeutics and reminiscence therapy focus of the Company, the Board of Directors and the majority shareholders of
the Company immediately following the closing of the EveryStory Transaction approved an amendment to the Company s Articles
of Incorporation to change the name of the Company (the  Name Change ) from Knowledge Machine International, Inc.,
to Dthera Sciences. The Name Change took effect at the same time as the Reverse Split on November 2, 2016. 

In connection with the Name Change, and
to help current shareholders and new investors better understand the business of the Company, the Company requested that a new
ticker symbol be assigned to the Company. The Company has requested  DTHR  as the new ticker symbol, which will take
effect twenty business days following the effectiveness of the Reverse Split (per FINRA rules). 

New Website  

Additionally, the Company launched a new
website, www.dthera.com, to provide information about the Company, its business and operations, and additional information about
digital therapeutics and reminiscence therapy. The link provided is for informational purposes only, and no information contained
on the Company s website should be deemed to be part of this or any filing of the Company. 

Commencement of Clinical Trial  

During November 2016, the University of
California at San Diego began the previously disclosed clinical trial of the use of the EveryStory Platform as a Digital Therapeutic
technology and Reminiscence Therapy treatment for patients with Alzheimer s disease and other diagnoses of dementia. The
Company anticipates that the clinical trial will be completed during the first fiscal quarter of 2017, and the Company will announce
the results of the trial upon its completion. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk  

As a smaller reporting company, the Company
is not required to provide the disclosure required by this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of disclosure controls
and procedures   

Our management, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer who is also our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 15(d)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the   Exchange Act  ))
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were not effective in ensuring that information required
to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and
communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period
covered by the Report, we did not have a formal audit committee and there was a lack of segregation of duties. 

Changes in internal control over
financial reporting   

There has been no change in our internal
control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act, during our most recent fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1A.  Risk Factors  

See  Item 1A   Risk Factors 
as disclosed in Form 10-K as filed with the Commission on October 13, 2016, as well as those included in the Company s Current
Report on form 8-K filed with the Commission on November 4, 2016. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities and Use of Proceeds.  

As noted above and as previously disclosed, on September 21,
2016, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Acquisition and Share Exchange Agreement (the  A R Agreement )
with EveryStory and each of its shareholder (the  Shareholders ), and closed the acquisition (the  Acquisition )
of the ownership of EveryStory (the  Closing ).  

Pursuant to the A R Agreement, the Company issued an aggregate
of 19,853,007 shares of the Company s common stock to the EveryStory holders and the holders of EveryStory convertible debt
which converted automatically at the closing of the EveryStory Transaction, with the understanding that an additional 4,146,993
shares were to be reserved for issuance to holders of EveryStory options which are exercisable into shares of EveryStory common
stock (collectively, the  Exchange Shares ). (As noted above, on November 2, 2016, a reverse stock split (the  Reverse
Split ) of the Company s common stock took effect. The ratio of the Reverse Split was 1:5.109375, meaning one new share
for each 5.109375 old shares of the Company s common stock. All share numbers provided in this Quarterly Report are given
on a post-reverse-split basis.) 

Additionally, prior to Closing, the Company conducted a non-public
offering of its Series A Convertible Preferred stock (the  Preferred Stock Offering ) to raise up to $120,000 for operating
funds for KMI and to satisfy accounts payable prior to Closing. One Hundred Thousand shares of KMI Series A Preferred Stock were
sold in the Preferred Stock Offering. The KMI Series A Preferred Stock converted into an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of the Company s
common stock immediately following the effectiveness of the Reverse Split. Pursuant to the Preferred Stock Offering, each investor
entered into a subscription agreement pursuant to which each investor represented and warranted that it was an accredited investor
and that he or she was purchasing the Preferred Stock for his or her own account, and not with a view to distribution, as well
as other standard representations made in private transactions. 

Further, the Company conducted a private offering of convertible
notes (the  Note Offering ) to raise additional capital that would remain in the Company following the Closing of the
EveryStory Transaction. In the Note Offering, investors entered into a securities purchase agreement (the  Note SPA )
and were issued a convertible redeemable promissory note (collectively, the  Convertible Note ). Pursuant to the terms
of the Note SPA, each investor represented and warranted that it was an accredited investor and that he or she was purchasing the
Convertible Note for his or her own account, and not with a view to distribution, as well as other standard representations made
in private transactions. Also pursuant to the Note SPA, the Company has the right to put an additional Convertible Note (in the
same principal amount as purchased by the applicable investor) beginning on January 3, 2017, subject to certain conditions. The
Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 10%, and mature on September 13, 2017, if not converted or prepaid prior to that.
The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of $0.195, subject
to adjustment as described in the Convertible Note. Up to 50% of the Convertible Notes may be repaid by the Company any time prior
to 180 days after the issuance of the Convertible Notes, with a 30% premium to be paid in connection with the prepayment. 

Based on the terms of the Convertible Notes, absent any adjustment
of the conversion price, the Company could be required to issue up to approximately 240,995 shares of the Company s common
stock if the entire principal amounts of the Convertible Notes were converted. The Company could be required to issue additional
shares of its common stock if interest accruing on the Convertible Notes is converted into shares (on the same formula as that
of the Convertible Notes), although as of the date of this Report, the Company could not determine how many shares could be issued
until such conversions occur. 

The securities offered and sold by the Company in the non-public
offerings (both the preferred stock and the convertible note offerings) and in the exchange transition with the shareholders of
EveryStory have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States
absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. 

The non-public offerings (both the preferred stock and the convertible
note offerings) and in the exchange transition with the shareholders of EveryStory were made in reliance on the private offering
exemption of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or the private offering safe harbor provisions of Rule 506 of Regulation
D based on the following factors: (i) the number of offerees or purchasers, as applicable, (ii) the absence of general solicitation,
(iii) investment representations obtained from the security holders in each of the transactions, (iv) the provision of appropriate
disclosure, and (v) the placement of restrictive legends on the certificates reflecting the securities. 

Item 5.  Other Information.  

Change in Auditors  

As previously disclosed, on November 8,
2016, the Board of Directors of the Company terminated Pritchett Siler   Hardy, P.C. ( PSH ), as the Company s
independent public accounting firm. The termination of PSH was not due to any disagreement with PSH over accounting or other issues,
but was done in connection with the closing of the EveryStory Transaction and the change in focus of the Company s business.
Also on November 8, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company engaged Sadler Gibb   Associates, LLC ( Sadler Gibb )
as the Company s new independent public accounting firm. Sadler Gibb had previously audited EveryStory s financial
statements in connection with the EveryStory Transaction. 

Change in Fiscal Year End  

Also as previously disclosed, on November
12, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company changed the fiscal year of the Company from June 30 to December 31. This report
includes an explanatory note relating to the change in fiscal year and the Company s reporting to the Commission on transition
reports.
