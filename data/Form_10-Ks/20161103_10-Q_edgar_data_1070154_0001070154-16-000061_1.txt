(1) Basis of Financial Statement Presentation 
    
  (a) Nature of Operations 
  Sterling Bancorp (the  Company ) is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding company headquartered in Montebello, New York, that owns all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Sterling National Bank (the  Bank ), its principal subsidiary. The Bank is a full-service regional bank specializing in the delivery of services and solutions to business owners, their families and consumers within the communities it serves through teams of dedicated and experienced relationship managers.   
    
  (b) Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include the accounts of the Company and all other entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accounting and financial reporting policies the Company follows conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) and to general practices within the banking industry, which include regulatory reporting instructions. 
    
  The consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position and results of operations. All such adjustments were of a normal and recurring nature. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and with the instructions to Form 10-Q adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto, for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on   February 29, 2016   (the  2015 Form 10-K ). Operating results for the interim periods disclosed herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year or any future period.  Certain items in prior financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 
    
  (c) Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expense and contingencies at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates, particularly the allowance for loan losses and the status of contingencies,  
    
  (d) Merger with Hudson Valley Holding Corp. 
  On   June 30, 2015  , HVHC merged with and into the Company (the  HVB Merger ).  In connection with the HVB Merger, Hudson Valley Bank, the principal subsidiary of HVHC, merged with and into the Bank.  
    
  (e) Merger with Sterling Bancorp 
  On   October 31, 2013  , Provident New York Bancorp ( Legacy Provident ) merged with legacy Sterling Bancorp ( Legacy Sterling ). In connection with the merger, the following corporate actions occurred: 

Legacy Sterling merged with and into Legacy Provident. 
                
    Legacy Provident was the accounting acquirer and the surviving entity.  
                
    Legacy Provident changed its legal entity name to Sterling Bancorp. 
                
    Sterling National Bank merged into Provident Bank.  
                
    Provident Bank changed its legal entity name to Sterling National Bank. 
       
  We refer to the merger with Legacy Sterling as the  Provident Merger.

(2) Acquisitions 
  Restaurant Franchise Financing Loan Portfolio 
  On September 9, 2016, the Bank acquired a restaurant franchise financing loan portfolio from GE Capital with an unpaid principal balance of   $169,760  .  Total cash paid for the portfolio was   $163,282  , which included a discount to the balance of gross loans receivable of   4.00%  , or   $6,790  , plus accrued interest receivable.  As the acquired assets did not constitute a business, the transaction was accounted for as an asset purchase. These loans are classified as traditional commercial and industrial loans.  See Note 4.  Portfolio Loans  for additional information. 
    
  NSBC Acquisition 
  On   March 31, 2016  , the Bank acquired   100%   of the outstanding equity interests of NSBC (the  NSBC Acquisition ). NSBC is a provider of asset-based lending solutions to middle market commercial clients.  NSBC s loans had a fair value of   $320,447   on the acquisition date and consisted of 100% floating-rate assets. The Bank paid a premium on the balance of gross loans receivable acquired of   5.90%  , or   $18,906  . The Bank assumed   $4,839   of liabilities, which consisted mainly of cash collateral on loans outstanding. The Bank recognized a customer list intangible asset of   $1,500   that is being amortized over its   24  -month estimated life and   $25,698   of goodwill. The Bank recorded a   $1,500   restructuring charge consisting mainly of retention and severance compensation, IT contract terminations and professional fees.  
    
  HVB Merger 
  On   June 30, 2015  , the Company completed the HVB Merger.  Under the terms of the HVB Merger agreement, HVHC shareholders received   1.92   shares of the Company s common stock for each share of HVHC common stock owned, which resulted in the issuance of   38,525,154   shares.  Based on the Company s closing stock price of   $14.63   per share on   June 29, 2015  , the aggregate consideration paid to HVHC shareholders was   $566,307  , which, in accordance with the HVB Merger agreement, also included the in-the-money cash value of outstanding HVHC stock options, the fair value of outstanding HVHC restricted stock awards and cash in lieu of fractional shares.  Consistent with the Company s strategy, the primary reason for the HVB Merger was the expansion of the Company s geographic footprint in the greater New York metropolitan region and beyond.  
    
  The assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, were recorded at their fair values as of   June 30, 2015  ,  based on management s best estimate and using the information available as of the HVB Merger date. The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in the recognition of goodwill of   $269,757   and a core deposit intangible of   $33,839  .  As of   June 30, 2015  , HVHC had assets with a net book value of approximately   $288,208  , including loans with a net book value of approximately   $1,816,767  , and deposits with a net book value of approximately   $3,160,746  . The table below summarizes the amounts recognized as of the HVB Merger date for each major class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the estimated fair value adjustments and the amounts recorded in the Company s financial statements at fair value at the HVB Merger date:

Explanation of certain fair value related adjustments: 
           (a) 
    Represents the fair value adjustment on investment securities held to maturity. 
              (b) 
    Represents the elimination of HVHC     s allowance for loan losses and an adjustment of the net book value of loans to estimated fair value, which includes an interest rate mark and credit mark adjustment. 
              (c) 
    Represents an adjustment to reflect the fair value of HVHC-owned real estate as determined by independent appraisals, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets. 
              (d) 
    Represents intangible assets recorded to reflect the fair value of core deposits.  The core deposit intangible asset was recorded as an identifiable intangible asset and will be amortized on an accelerated basis over the estimated average life of the deposit base.  
              (e) 
    Represents an adjustment in net deferred tax assets resulting from the fair value adjustments related to the acquired assets, liabilities assumed and identifiable intangibles recorded. 
              (f) 
    Represents the elimination of HVHC s deferred rent liability. 
       
  The fair values for loans acquired from HVHC were estimated using cash flow projections based on the remaining maturity and repricing terms. Cash flows were adjusted by estimating future credit losses and the rate of prepayments.  Projected monthly cash flows were then discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted market rate for similar loans.  For collateral dependent loans with deteriorated credit quality, fair value was estimated by analyzing the value of the underlying collateral, assuming the fair values of the loans were derived from the eventual sale of the collateral.  These values were discounted using market derived rates of return, with consideration given to the period of time and costs associated with the foreclosure and disposition of the collateral.  There was no carryover of HVHC s allowance for loan losses associated with the loans that were acquired, as the loans were initially recorded at fair value on the date of the HVB Merger.

  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

Acquired loan portfolio data in the HVB Merger is presented below: 

The core deposit intangible asset recognized is being amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately   10   years utilizing the sum-of-the-years digits method.  Other intangibles consist of below-market rents, which are amortized over the remaining life of each lease using the straight-line method. 
    
  Goodwill is not amortized for book purposes; however, it is reviewed at least annually for impairment and is not deductible for tax purposes. 
  The fair value of land, buildings and equipment was estimated using appraisals.  Buildings will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately   30   years.  Improvements and equipment will be amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives ranging from   one   to   five   years.  
  The fair value of retail demand and interest bearing deposit accounts was assumed to approximate the carrying value as these accounts have no stated maturity and are payable on demand.  The fair value of time deposits was estimated by discounting the contractual future cash flows using market rates offered for time deposits of similar remaining maturities.  Management concluded the carrying value was an appropriate estimate of fair value for these deposits.  
  Direct acquisition and other charges incurred in connection with the HVB Merger were expensed as incurred and totaled   $0   and   $14,381   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. These expenses were mainly for financial advisory fees, legal and accounting fees, severance and retention compensation, management change-in-control payments, public relations and communications expense, and were recorded in  Merger-related expenses  on the consolidated income statement. Other integration costs of the HVB Merger for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a charge for asset write-downs, information technology services and other contract terminations, employee retention and severance compensation and impairment of leases and facilities which totaled   $28,055  , and was recorded in  Other non-interest expense  in the consolidated income statement.  There were   no   merger-related expenses or other integration costs incurred in connection with the HVB Merger in 2016. 
  FCC Acquisition 
  On May 7, 2015, the Bank acquired a factoring portfolio from FCC, LLC, a subsidiary of First Capital Holdings, Inc. ( FCC ), with an outstanding factoring receivables balance of approximately   $44,500  .  The total consideration included a premium of   $1,000   in addition to the outstanding receivables balance. 
  Damian Acquisition 
  On   February 27, 2015  , the Bank acquired   100%   of the outstanding common stock of Damian Services Corporation ( Damian ), a payroll services provider located in Chicago, Illinois, for total consideration of   $24,670   in cash. In connection with the acquisition, the Bank acquired   $22,307   of outstanding payroll finance loans and assumed   $14,560   of liabilities.  The Bank recognized a customer list intangible asset of   $8,950   that is being amortized over its   16  -year estimated life, and   $11,930   of goodwill. The Bank also recognized a   $1,500   restructuring charge consisting mainly of retention and severance compensation and asset write-downs related to the consolidation of Damian s operations, and approximately   $300   of legal fees.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities at   September 30, 2016   are presented below by contractual maturity. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. Residential MBS are shown separately since they are not due at a single maturity date.  

Sales of securities for the periods indicated below were as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders  equity, other than the U.S. federal government and its agencies.

  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

The following table summarizes securities held to maturity with unrecognized losses, segregated by the length of time in a continuous unrecognized loss position for the periods presented below: 

At   September 30, 2016  , a total of   56   available for sale securities were in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than   12   months and   46   available for sale securities were in a continuous unrealized loss position for   12   months or longer. Declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses. The amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. In estimating other than temporary impairment ( OTTI ) losses, management considers, among other things, (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and (iii) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in cost.   
    
  Management has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held to maturity in the table above until they mature, at which time the Company anticipates it will receive full value for the securities. Furthermore, as of   September 30, 2016  , management did not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale in the table above and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. Any unrealized losses are largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons related to credit quality. As of   September 30, 2016  , management believes the impairments detailed in the table above are temporary.

The following table provides additional analysis of the Company s non-accrual loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1)    The Company acquired loans for which there was, at acquisition, both evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and probability, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments would not be collected. These loans are classified as purchased credit impaired loans ( PCI loans ). 
    
  There were   no   non-accrual asset-based lending or warehouse lending loans at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  When the ultimate collectibility of the total principal of an impaired loan is in doubt and the loan is on non-accrual status, all payments are applied to principal, under the cost recovery method. When the ultimate collectibility of the total principal of an impaired loan is not in doubt and the loan is on non-accrual status, contractual interest is credited to interest income when received, under the cash basis method.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the recorded investment of residential mortgage loans that were in the process of foreclosure was   $9,935   and   $9,638  , respectively, which are included in non-accrual residential mortgage loans above.

The following table sets forth loans evaluated for impairment by segment and the allowance evaluated by segment at   December 31, 2015  : 

Management considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is determined that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract, including scheduled interest payments. Evaluation of impairment is treated the same across all classes of loans on a loan-by-loan basis, except residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit ( HELOC ) with an outstanding balance of   $500   or less, which are evaluated for impairment on a homogeneous pool basis.  (HELOC loans are included with consumer loans.) When management identifies a loan as impaired, the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except when the sole remaining source of repayment of the loan is the operation or liquidation of the collateral. In these cases, management uses the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs when foreclosure or liquidation is probable, instead of discounted cash flows. If management

determines that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (net of previous charge-offs, deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount), impairment is generally recognized through a charge-off to the allowance for loan losses.  
    
  The carrying amount of PCI loans is presented in the tables above. At   September 30, 2016  , the net recorded amount of PCI loans was   $94,108  , which included   $20,747   of asset-based lending loans acquired in the NSBC Acquisition. There was   $621   and   $272   included in the allowance for loan losses associated with PCI loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The following table presents the changes in the balance of the accretable yield discount for PCI loans for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Income is not recognized on PCI loans unless the Company can reasonably estimate the cash flows that are expected to be collected over the life of the loan.  The balance of PCI loans that were treated under the cost recovery method was   $13,295   and   $20,025   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The following table presents loans individually evaluated for impairment, excluding purchased credit impaired loans, by segment of loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The Company s policy generally requires a charge-off of the difference between the present value of the cash flows or the net collateral value of the collateral securing the loan and the Company s recorded investment.  As a result, there were   no   impaired loans with an allowance recorded at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

  Troubled Debt Restructuring ( TDRs ) 
  The following tables set forth the amounts and past due status of the Company s TDRs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :   

There were no asset-based lending, payroll finance, warehouse lending, factored receivables or multi-family loans that were TDRs for either period presented above and there were no consumer loans that were TDRs at December 31, 2015.  The Company did not have outstanding commitments to lend additional amounts to customers with loans classified as TDRs as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  There was   one   loan modified as a TDR in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . This TDR did not increase the allowance for loan losses and did not result in charge-offs in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  There were   no   loans modified as a TDR during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  The following table presents loans by segment modified as TDRs that occurred during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  : 

There were   no   TDRs that were modified during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or 2015 that subsequently defaulted (which is defined as missing three consecutive monthly payments or being over 90 days past due on a scheduled payment).

Credit Quality Indicators 
  As part of the ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators, including trends related to (i) the weighted-average risk grade of commercial loans; (ii) the level of classified commercial loans; (iii) the delinquency status of residential mortgage and consumer loans HELOC and other consumer loans); (iv) net charge-offs; (v) non-performing loans (see details above); and (vi) the general economic conditions in the greater New York metropolitan region. The Bank analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans by credit risk, except residential mortgage loans, HELOC and other consumer loans, which are evaluated on a homogeneous pool basis unless the loan balance is greater than   $500  . This analysis is performed at least quarterly on all criticized/classified loans. The Bank uses the following definitions of risk ratings:

  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

1 and 2 -   These grades include loans that are secured by cash, marketable securities or cash surrender value of life insurance policies. 
    
  3 -   This grade includes loans to borrowers with strong earnings and cash flow and that have the ability to service debt. The borrower s assets and liabilities are generally well-matched and are above average quality.  The borrower has ready access to multiple sources of funding, including alternatives such as term loans, private equity placements or trade credit. 
    
  4 -   This grade includes loans to borrowers with above average cash flow, adequate earnings and debt service coverage ratios.  The borrower generates discretionary cash flow, assets and liabilities are reasonably matched, and the borrower has access to other sources of debt funding or additional trade credit at market rates. 
    
  5 -   This grade includes loans to borrowers with adequate earnings and cash flow and reasonable debt service coverage ratios.  Overall leverage is acceptable and there is average reliance upon trade credit.  Management has a reasonable amount of experience and depth, and owners are willing to invest available outside capital, as necessary.  
    
  6 -   This grade includes loans to borrowers where there is evidence of some strain, earnings are inconsistent and volatile, and the borrowers  outlook is uncertain.  Generally, such borrowers have higher leverage than those with a better risk rating.  These borrowers typically have limited access to alternative sources of bank debt and may be dependent upon debt funding for working capital support. 
    
  7 - Special Mention (OCC definition) -   Other Assets Especially Mentioned ( OAEM ) are loans that have potential weaknesses which may, if not reversed or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the Bank s credit position at some future date. Such assets constitute an undue and unwarranted credit risk but not to the point of justifying a classification of  Substandard.  The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitute an unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific asset. 
    
  8 - Substandard (OCC definition)   - These loans are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some losses if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified as substandard. 
    
  9 - Doubtful (OCC definition)     -   These loans have all the weakness inherent in one classified as  Substandard  with the added characteristics that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but, because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors may include a proposed merger, acquisition, liquidating procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens or additional collateral and refinancing plans. 
    
  10 - Loss (OCC definition) -   These loans are charged-off because they are determined to be uncollectible and unbankable assets. This classification does not indicate that the asset has no absolute recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing-off this asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. Losses should be taken in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible.

(8) Borrowings 
    
  The Company s borrowings and weighted average interest rates were as follows for the periods presented:    

FHLB borrowings.   As a member of the FHLB, the Bank may borrow up to a discounted percentage of the amount of eligible mortgages and securities that have been pledged as collateral under a blanket security agreement. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had total residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans pledged after discount of   $2,324,599   and   $2,050,982  , respectively.  In addition to the pledged mortgages, the Bank had also pledged securities to secure borrowings, which are disclosed in Note 3.  Securities.   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had unused borrowing capacity at the FHLB of   $1,304,179   and may increase its borrowing capacity by pledging securities not required to be pledged for other purposes with a collateral value of approximately   $872,734  . 
    
  FHLB borrowings included   $200,000   at   December 31, 2015   that were putable quarterly at the discretion of the FHLB. These borrowings had a weighted average remaining term to the contractual maturity dates of approximately   1.31   years at   December 31, 2015  , and a weighted average interest rate of   4.23%  . The Company redeemed these borrowings on March 31, 2016, together with   $20,000   of other borrowings with an interest rate of   3.57%  .  The Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt associated with these repayments of   $8,716  , which is included in non-interest expense in the consolidated income statements.  
    
  Other borrowings (repurchase agreements).   The Bank enters into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase.  These repurchase agreements facilitate the needs of our customers and a portion of our secured short-term funding needs. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are secured short-term borrowings that mature in   one   to   45 days   and are generally renewed on a continuous basis.  Repurchase agreements are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with these transactions.  The securities pledged under these repurchase agreements fluctuate in value due to market conditions. The Bank is obligated to promptly transfer additional securities if the market value of the securities falls below the repurchase agreement price. Securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements are maintained with our safekeeping agents.  
    
  Senior Notes.   On   July 2, 2013  , the Company issued   $100,000   principal amount of   5.50%   fixed rate senior notes (the  Senior Notes )  through a private placement at a discount of   1.75%  . The cost of issuance was   $303  , and at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the unamortized discount was   $612   and   $1,107  , respectively, which will be accreted to interest expense over the life of the Senior Notes, resulting in an effective yield of   5.98%  .  Interest is due semi-annually in arrears on   January 2   and   July 2   until maturity on   July 2, 2018  . During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company redeemed   $23,000   of the Senior Notes and incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt associated with this repayment of   $1,013  , which is included in non-interest expense in the consolidated income statements.

Subordinated Notes  . On   March 29, 2016  , the Bank issued   $110,000   principal amount of   5.25%   fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the  Subordinated Notes ) through a private placement at a discount of   1.25%  .  The cost of issuance was   $500  . On September 2, 2016, the Bank reopened the Subordinated Notes offering and issued an additional   $65,000   principal amount of Subordinated Notes.  The Subordinated Notes issued September 2, 2016 are fully fungible with, rank equally in right of payment with, and form a single series with the existing Subordinated Notes.  The notes were issued to the purchasers at a premium of   0.50%   and an underwriters discount of   1.25%  .  The cost of issuance was   $275  . At   September 30, 2016  , the net unamortized discount of all Subordinated Notes was   $2,551  , which will be accreted to interest expense over the life of the Subordinated Notes, resulting in an effective yield of   5.45%  .  Interest is due semi-annually in arrears on   April 1   and   October 1   of each year, beginning on   October 1, 2016  , until   April 1, 2021  .  From and including   April 1, 2021  , the Subordinated Notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR plus   3.937%  , payable quarterly on   January 1  ,   April 1  ,   July 1   and   October 1   of each year, beginning on   July 1, 2021  , through maturity on   April 1, 2026   or earlier redemption. The Subordinated Notes are also redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on April 1, 2021 and each interest payment date thereafter. The Subordinated Notes are redeemable in whole at any time upon the occurrence of certain specified events. The Subordinated Notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of the Bank and are subordinated in right of payment to all of the Bank s existing and future senior indebtedness, including claims of depositors and general creditors. The Subordinated Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.  See Note 15.  Stockholders  Equity,  for additional information. 
    
  Revolving line of credit.   On September 5, 2016, the Company renewed its   $25,000   revolving line of credit facility (the  Credit Facility ).  The Credit Facility, which is with another financial institution, matures on September 4, 2017. The balance was   zero   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The use of proceeds are for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility and accrued interest is payable at maturity, and the Company is required to maintain a   zero   balance for at least   30   days during its term. Loans under the Credit Facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus   1.25%  .  Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company and the Bank must maintain certain ratios related to capital, non-performing assets to capital, reserves to non-performing loans and debt service coverage.  The Company and the Bank were in compliance with all requirements of the Credit Facility at   September 30, 2016  .  

(9) Derivatives 
    
  The Company has entered into certain interest rate swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments.  These derivative contracts relate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a customer while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with another financial institution. In connection with each swap transaction, the Company agrees to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the customer on a similar notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the same time, the Company agrees to pay another financial institution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. The transaction allows the Company s customers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate loan. Because the Company acts as an intermediary for its customers, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts largely offset each other and do not materially impact results of operations. 
    
  The Company pledged cash of   $2,139   and investment securities with a fair value of   $5,100   as of   September 30, 2016   as collateral for the swaps with another financial institution. The Company may need to post additional collateral to swap counterparties in the future in proportion to potential increases in unrealized loss positions.  
    
  The Company does not typically require its commercial customers to post cash or securities as collateral on its program of back-to-back swaps. However, certain language is written into the International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement and loan documents where, in default situations, the Company is allowed to access collateral supporting the loan relationship to recover any losses suffered on the derivative asset or liability.

  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

Summary information as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   regarding these derivatives is presented below: 

The Company enters into various commitments to sell real estate loans into the secondary market. Such commitments are considered to be derivative financial instruments; however, the fair value of these commitments is not material. 

(10) Income Taxes 
    
  Actual income tax expense differs from the tax computed based on pre-tax income and the applicable statutory Federal tax rate for the  
  following reasons: 

Net deferred tax assets totaled   $16,865   at   September 30, 2016   and   $31,079   at   December 31, 2015  . No valuation allowance was recorded against deferred tax assets as of those dates, as management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized because they were supported by recoverable taxes paid in prior years. There were no unrecognized tax benefits during any of the reported periods. Interest and/or penalties related to income taxes are reported as a component of other non-interest expense. Such amounts were not material during the reported periods. 
    
  The Company is generally no longer subject to examination by Federal, state and local taxing authorities for fiscal years prior to September 30, 2012. 
   
  (11) Stock-Based Compensation  
    
  The Company has active stock-based compensation plans, as described below.   
    
  The Company s stockholders approved the 2015 Omnibus Equity and Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ) on May 28, 2015.  The 2015 Plan permits the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock (both time-based and performance-based), restricted stock units, deferred stock and other stock-based awards.  The total number of shares that may be awarded under the 2015 Plan is   2,800,000   shares plus the remaining shares available for grant under the stockholder approved 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2014

  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

Plan ) as of the adoption of the 2015 Plan.  At   September 30, 2016  , there were in aggregate   3,639,239   shares available for future grant under the 2015 Plan.  
    
  The approval of the 2015 Plan resulted in the termination of the 2014 Plan.  Awards granted under the 2014 Plan that were outstanding as of May 28, 2015 will continue to be governed by the 2014 Plan document; except as otherwise provided in the 2015 Plan with respect to forfeited awards.  No future grants will be made under the 2014 Plan.  
    
  Under the 2015 Plan,   one   share is deducted from the 2015 Plan for every share or share underlying the equity award that is awarded and delivered under the 2015 Plan.  
    
  Restricted stock awards are granted with a fair value equal to the market price of the Company s common stock at the date of grant.  Stock option awards are granted with a strike price that is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock at the date of grant. The restricted stock awards generally vest in equal installments annually on the anniversary date and have total vesting periods ranging from   1   to   5   years, with stock options having   10  -year contractual terms. 
    
  In addition to the 2015 Plan and the 2014 Plan, the Company previously granted awards under its 2011 Employment Inducement Stock Program, which included options to purchase   107,526   shares of common stock and restricted stock awards covering   29,550   shares of common stock, both of which vested in   four   equal installments through July 2015.  
    
  In connection with the Provident Merger, the Company granted   104,152   options at an exercise price of   $14.25   per share pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-8 under which the Company assumed all outstanding fully-vested Legacy Sterling stock options, which expire on   March 15, 2017  . The Company also granted   95,991   shares under the Sterling Bancorp 2013 Employment Inducement Award Plan to certain executive officers of Legacy Sterling. In addition, the Company issued   255,973   shares of restricted stock from shares available under a prior plan to certain executives of Legacy Sterling. The weighted average grant date fair value under both of these plans was   $11.72   per share, and the restricted stock awards vest in equal annual installments on the anniversary date over a   three  -year period. 
    
  The following table summarizes the activity in the Company s active stock-based compensation plans for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

The total intrinsic value of outstanding in-the-money stock options and outstanding in-the-money exercisable stock options was $  6,966   and $  $5,401  , respectively, at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The Company uses an option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options granted. There were   no   stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  There were   19,566   stock options granted during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The weighted average estimated value per option granted was   $2.11   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   and was determined using the following weighted average assumptions as of the grant date:

After settlement of all Plan obligations, a pension reversion asset of   $10,312   and   $11,442   (recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets) at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, is held in custody by the Company s 401(k) plan custodian and will be charged to earnings over the next   five   to   seven   years as it is distributed to employees under qualified compensation and benefit programs.  
    
  The Company s other post-retirement plans include a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP ) that provides certain officers and executives with supplemental retirement benefits. The Company contributed   $77   and   $79   to fund SERP benefits during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Total post retirement plan liabilities were   $12,017   and   $11,733   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

  (15) Stockholders  Equity  
    
  (a) Regulatory Capital Requirements 
  Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines, and additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk-weighting, and other factors.   
    
  The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions).  Quantitative measures established by the Basel III Capital Rules to ensure capital adequacy require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Common Equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations), Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) and Total capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the regulations,  RWA ), and of Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (as defined in the regulations) (the  Tier 1 leverage ratio ). 
    
  The Company s and the Bank s Common Equity Tier 1 capital consists of common stock and related paid-in capital, net of treasury stock, and retained earnings. In connection with the adoption of the Basel III Capital Rules, we elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Common Equity Tier 1 capital for both the Company and the Bank is reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities and subject to transition provisions. 
    
  Tier 1 capital includes Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital (as defined in the regulations) for both the Bank and the Company includes a permissible portion of the allowance for loan losses and   $172,449   and   $155,687   of the Subordinated Notes, respectively.  During the final five years of the term of the Subordinated Notes the permissible portion eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 capital decreases by 20% annually. See Note 8.  Borrowings.    
    
  The Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios are calculated by dividing the respective capital amounts by RWA. RWA is calculated based on regulatory requirements and includes total assets, excluding goodwill and other intangible assets, allocated by risk weight category, and certain off-balance-sheet items, among other items.  
    
  The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by adjusted quarterly average total assets, which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, among other items.  When fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Company and the Bank to maintain: (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to RWA of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5%  capital conservation buffer  (which is added to the 4.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to RWA of at least 7.0% upon full implementation); (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to RWA of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to RWA of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and (iv) a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. 
    
  The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and is being phased-in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a  countercyclical capital buffer  that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to the Company or the Bank.   
    
  The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to RWA above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.

The following tables present actual and required capital ratios as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for the Company and the Bank under the Basel III Capital Rules. The minimum required capital amounts presented include the minimum required capital levels as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   based on the phase-in provisions of the Basel III Capital Rules and the minimum required capital levels as of January 1, 2019 when the Basel III Capital Rules have been fully phased-in. Capital levels required to be considered well-capitalized are based upon prompt corrective action regulations, as amended to reflect the changes under the Basel III Capital Rules. 

The Bank and the Company are subject to the regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve, and, for the Bank, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  Regulatory authorities can initiate certain mandatory actions if the Bank or the Company fail to meet the minimum capital requirements, which could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. As of

  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

September 30, 2016  , management believes that the Bank and the Company meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.  
    
  (b) Dividend Restrictions  
  The Company is mainly dependent upon dividends from the Bank to provide funds for the payment of dividends to stockholders and to provide for other cash requirements.  Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid.  Approval by regulatory authorities is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of the Bank to fall below specified minimum levels.  Approval is also required if dividends declared exceed the net profits for that fiscal year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two fiscal years.  Under the foregoing dividend restrictions and while maintaining its  well-capitalized  status, at   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had capacity to pay aggregate dividends of up to   $115,012   to the Company without prior regulatory approval.  
    
  (c) Capital Raise 
  On   February 11, 2015  , the Company completed a public offering of   6.9 million   shares of common stock at an offering price of   $13.00   per share for gross proceeds of approximately $  89,700  , and net proceeds, after underwriting discounts, commissions and other costs of issuance, of   $85,059  . 
    
  (d) Stock Repurchase Plans 
  From time to time, the Company s Board of Directors has authorized stock repurchase plans.  The Company has   776,713   shares that are available to be purchased under a previously announced stock repurchase program.  There were   no   shares repurchased under the repurchase program during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  (e) Liquidation Rights 
  Upon completion of a second-step conversion in   January 2004  , the Bank established a special  liquidation account  in accordance with Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations. The account was established for the benefit of Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders (as defined in the plan of conversion) in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the Mutual Holding Company s (as defined in the plan of conversion) ownership interest in the retained earnings of the Bank as of the date of its latest balance sheet contained in the prospectus; or (ii) the retained earnings of the Bank at the time that the Bank reorganized into the Mutual Holding Company in 1999. Each Eligible Account Holder and Supplemental Eligible Account Holder that continues to maintain his or her deposit account at the Bank would be entitled, in the event of a complete liquidation of the Bank, to a pro rata interest in the liquidation account prior to any payment to the stockholders of the Company. The liquidation account is reduced annually on September 30 to the extent that Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders have reduced their qualifying deposits as of each anniversary date. At   September 30, 2016  , the liquidation account had a balance of   $13,300  . Subsequent increases in deposits do not restore such account holder s interest in the liquidation account. The Bank may not pay cash dividends or make other capital distributions if the effect thereof would reduce its stockholders  equity below the amount of the liquidation account. 
    
  (f) Impact of the HVB Merger 
  On June 30, 2015, the Company completed the HVB Merger.  In connection with the HVB Merger, the Company issued   38.5 million   shares of common stock to HVHC shareholders, which resulted in an increase of   $563,613   in stockholders  equity.  

(16) Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  (a) Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments 
  In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in its consolidated balance sheet.  The Company enters into these transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers.  These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.  The Company minimizes its exposure to losses under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures.  
    
  The Company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes.  Substantially all of the Company s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third-party, the Company would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment were funded, the Company would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. Based on the

  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

Company s credit risk exposure assessment of its standby letter of credit arrangements, the arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements.  
    
  The contractual or notional amounts of these instruments, which reflect the extent of the Company s involvement in particular classes of off-balance sheet financial instruments, are summarized as follows:    

(b) Lease Commitments 
  The Company leases certain premises and equipment under operating leases with terms expiring through January 2034. Included in occupancy and office operations expense was net rent expense of   $2,394   and   $3,335   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and net rent expense of   $8,115   and   $6,570   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Future minimum lease payments due under non-cancelable operating leases at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

(c) Litigation 
  The Company and the Bank are involved in a number of judicial proceedings concerning matters arising from their business activities. These include routine legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.  These proceedings also include actions brought against the Company and the Bank with respect to corporate matters and transactions in which the Company and the Bank are or were involved.  In addition, the Company and the Bank may be requested to provide information or otherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct of investigations of other persons or industry groups.  
    
  There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of a legal proceeding; however, the Company and the Bank have generally denied liability in all significant litigation pending against them and intend to defend vigorously each case, other than matters that are determined appropriate to be settled.  The Company and the Bank accrue a liability for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those claims.

(17) Fair value measurements 
    
  Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: 
    
  Level 1 Inputs   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
    
  Level 2 Inputs   Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, market data by correlation or other means. 
    
  Level 3 Inputs   Unobservable inputs for determining the fair value of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.  
    
  In general, fair value is based on quoted market prices, when available.  If quoted market prices in active markets are not available, fair value is based on internally developed models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value.   These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Company s creditworthiness, among other items, as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time. The Company s valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While management believes the Company s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Furthermore, the reported fair value amounts have not been comprehensively revalued since the presentation dates;  therefore, estimates of fair value after the balance sheet date may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. A more detailed description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value is set forth below. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the actual date of the event or circumstances that caused the transfer, which usually coincide with the Company s monthly and/or quarterly valuation process. 
    
  Investment Securities Available for Sale 
  The majority of the Company s available for sale investment securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the securities  terms and conditions, among other things. 
    
  The Company reviews the prices supplied by the independent pricing service, as well as their underlying pricing methodologies, for reasonableness and to ensure such prices are aligned with traditional pricing matrices. In general, the Company does not purchase investment securities that have a complicated structure. The Company s entire portfolio consists of traditional investments, nearly all of which are mortgage pass-through securities, state and municipal general obligation or revenue bonds, U.S. agency bullet and callable securities and corporate bonds.  Pricing for such instruments is fairly generic and is easily obtained. From time to time, the Company validates, on a sample basis, prices supplied by the independent pricing service by comparison to prices obtained from third-party sources or derived using internal models. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we do not believe any of our securities are OTTI; however, we review all of our securities on at least a quarterly basis to assess whether impairment, if any, is OTTI. 
    
  Derivatives 
  The fair values of derivatives are based on valuation models using current market terms (including interest rates and fees), the remaining terms of the agreements, and the creditworthiness of the counterparty as of the measurement date (Level 2 inputs). The Company s derivatives consist of interest rate swaps. See Note 9.  Derivatives  for additional information.

Commitments to Sell Real Estate Loans 
  The Company enters into various commitments to sell real estate loans in the secondary market. Such commitments are considered to be derivative financial instruments and if material, are carried at estimated fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. The estimated fair values of these commitments were generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell to certain government sponsored agencies. The fair values of these commitments generally result in a Level 2 classification and are not material. 
    
  A summary of such assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, were measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis was as follows: 

(1)   Residential mortgage-backed securities ( MBS ) are debt securities whose cash flows come from residential loans, such as mortgages and home-equity loans.  A residential MBS is comprised of a pool of mortgage loans created by financial institutions including governmental agencies.  The cash flows from each of the mortgage loans included in the pool are structured through a special purpose entity into various classes and tranches, which then issue securities backed by those cash flows to investors.  
    
  (2)    Collateralized Mortgage Obligations ( CMOs ) are debt securities that are collateralized by a specific pool of residential mortgage loans, in which the issuer of the CMOs can direct the payments of principal and interest received on the underlying collateral to achieve specific investor cash flow objectives.  The Bank generally acquires planned-amortization class securities and CMOs with a sequential pay structure in order to manage the duration and extension risk inherent in these securities.

  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

The following categories of financial assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. 
    
  Loans Held for Sale and Impaired Loans 
  Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value, as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. Fair value of loans held for sale is determined using quoted prices for similar assets (Level 2 inputs). 
    
  When mortgage loans held for sale are sold with servicing rights retained, the carrying value of mortgage loans sold is reduced by the amount allocated to the value of the servicing rights, which is equal to its fair value. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are based on the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related loan sold. 
    
  The Company may record adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurements for partial charge-offs of the uncollectible portions of these loans. These adjustments also include certain impairment amounts for collateral dependent loans calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 310     Receivables   when establishing the allowance for loan losses. Impairment amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and, as a result, the carrying value of the loan less the calculated impairment amount applicable to that loan does not necessarily represent the fair value of the loan. Real estate collateral is valued using independent appraisals or other indications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally observable by market participants. However, due to the substantial judgment applied and limited volume of activity as compared to other assets, fair value of the underlying collateral is based on Level 3 inputs. Estimates of fair value used for collateral supporting commercial loans generally are based on assumptions not observable in the market place and are also based on Level 3 inputs. Impaired loans are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and their carrying values are adjusted as needed.  Loans subject to non-recurring fair value measurements were   $59,428   and   $28,372   at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Changes in fair value recognized as a charge-off on loans held by the Company were   $314   and   $280   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  When valuing impaired loans that are collateral dependent, the Company charges-off the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the appraised value, which is generally less than 12 months old.  A discount for estimated costs to dispose of the asset is used when evaluating the impaired loans.

A summary of the class with impaired loans at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, is set forth below: 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 
  When mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in net gain on sales of loans. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. 
    
  The Company utilizes the amortization method to subsequently measure the carrying value of its servicing rights. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 860 -   Transfers and Servicing,   the Company must record impairment charges on a non-recurring basis, when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. To estimate the fair value of servicing rights, the Company utilizes a third-party valuation provider which, on a quarterly basis, considers the market prices for similar assets and the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the servicing rights. Assumptions utilized include estimates of the cost of servicing, loan default rates, an appropriate discount rate and prepayment speeds. The determination of fair value of servicing rights relies upon Level 3 inputs. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $1,039   and   $1,204  , respectively. 
    
  Assets Taken in Foreclosure of Defaulted Loans 
  Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, which establishes a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell and are primarily comprised of commercial and residential real estate property and, upon initial recognition, are re-measured and reported at fair value through a charge-off to the allowance for loan losses based on the fair value of the foreclosed asset. The fair value is generally determined using appraisals or other indications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally observable in the marketplace. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by independent appraisers to adjust for differences between comparable sales and income data available. The fair value is derived using Level 3 inputs. Appraisals are reviewed by the Company s credit department and an external loan review consultant and verified by officers in the Company s credit administration area.  Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans and facilities held for sale subject to non-recurring fair value measurement were   $16,422   and   $14,614   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. There were   $582   and   $0   of write-downs related to changes in fair value for those foreclosed assets held by the Company during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

Significant Unobservable Inputs to Level 3 Measurements 
  The following table presents quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements for Level 3 assets at   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)    Represents range of discount factors applied to the appraisal to determine fair value.  The amounts used for mortgage servicing rights are discounts applied by a third-party valuation provider, which the Company believes are appropriate.   
    
   (2)    Excludes   $1,210   of commercial properties that are former financial centers that were closed and are now held for sale.  These assets were not taken in foreclosure and their fair value is determined by third-party appraisals and our internal assessment of the market for this type of real estate. 
    
  Fair Values of Financial Instruments 
  FASB ASC Topic 825 -   Financial Instruments   requires disclosure of fair value information for those financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, whether or not such financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated financial statements for interim and annual periods. Fair value is the amount for which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. 
    
  Quoted market prices are used to estimate fair values when those prices are available, although active markets do not exist for many types of financial instruments. Fair values for these instruments must be estimated by management using techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and comparison to similar instruments. These estimates are highly subjective and require judgments regarding significant matters, such as the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates that appropriately reflect market and credit risks. Changes in these judgments often have a material effect on the fair value estimates. Since these estimates are made as of a specific point in time, they are susceptible to material near-term changes. Fair values disclosed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 825 do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from the sale of a large volume of a particular financial instrument, nor do they reflect possible tax ramifications or estimated transaction costs.

The following is a summary of the carrying amounts and estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities (none of which were held for trading purposes) as of   December 31, 2015  : 

The following paragraphs summarize the principal methods and assumptions used by the Company to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial instruments: 
    
  Loans 
  The estimated fair value approximates the carrying value for variable-rate loans that reprice frequently with no significant change in credit risk. The fair value of fixed-rate loans and variable-rate loans which reprice on an infrequent basis is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality. An overall valuation adjustment is made for specific credit risks, as well as general portfolio credit risk. 
    
  FHLB Stock and FRB Stock 
  The redeemable carrying amount of these securities with limited marketability approximates their fair value. 
    
  Deposits and Mortgage Escrow Funds 
  In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 825 -   Financial Instruments  , deposits with no stated maturity (such as demand, money market and savings deposits) are assigned fair values equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. Certificates of deposit and mortgage escrow funds are segregated by account type and original term, and fair values are estimated by discounting the contractual cash flows. The discount rate for each account grouping is equivalent to the current market rates for deposits of similar type and maturity. 
    
  These fair values do not include the value of core deposit relationships that comprise a significant portion of the Company s deposits. We believe that the Company s core deposit relationships provide a relatively stable, low-cost funding source that has a substantial value separate from the deposit balances.

  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

FHLB Borrowings, Other Borrowings, Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes 
  The estimated fair value approximates the carrying value for short-term borrowings. The fair value of long-term fixed-rate borrowings is estimated using quoted market prices, if available, or by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar financial instruments.  
    
  Other Financial Instruments 
  Other financial assets and liabilities listed in the tables above have estimated fair values that approximate their respective carrying amounts because the instruments are payable on demand or have short-term maturities and present relatively low credit risk and interest rate risk. 
    
  The fair values of the Company s off-balance sheet financial instruments described in the  Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments  section of Note 16.  Commitments and Contingencies  were estimated based on current market terms (including interest rates and fees), considering the remaining terms of the agreements and the creditworthiness of the counterparties.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the estimated fair value of these instruments approximated the related carrying amounts, which were not material. 
    
  Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable 
  The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value and are classified in accordance with the related instrument.

  Components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ) were as follows as of the dates shown below:

(19) Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
    
  Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).    ASU 2014-09 implements a revenue standard that clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 was originally expected to be effective for the Company on January 1, 2017; however, the FASB subsequently issued ASU 2015-14,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Deferral of the Effective Date,    which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2016-1,    Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.    ASU 2016-1, among other things; (i) requires equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (ii) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; (iii) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; (iv) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (v) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (vi) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements and (vii) clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities. ASU 2016-1 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a significant impact on its financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).    ASU 2016-02 will, among other things, require lessees to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and ASC Topic 606,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers.    ASU 2016-2 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and will require the Company to transition using a modified retrospective approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and its regulatory capital ratios. 
    
  ASU 2016-05,    Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.    ASU 2016-05 clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under ASC Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship, provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. ASU 2016-05 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a significant impact on its financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2016-07,    Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.    ASU 2016-07 impacts all entities that have an investment that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. ASU 2016-07 simplifies the transition to the equity method of accounting by eliminating retroactive adjustment of the investment when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method, among other things. ASU 2016-07 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a significant impact on its financial statements.           
  ASU 2016-08,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).    ASU 2016-08 was issued to clarify certain principal versus agent considerations within the implementation guidance of ASC Topic 606,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers.    The effective date and transition of ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),   as discussed above. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-08 on its financial statements.

ASU 2016-09,    Compensation - Stock compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    Under ASU 2016-09, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payment awards should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement during the period in which they occur. Previously, such amounts were recorded in the pool of excess tax benefits included in additional paid-in capital, if such pool was available. Because excess tax benefits are no longer recognized in additional paid-in capital, the assumed proceeds from applying the treasury stock method when computing earnings per share should exclude the amount of excess tax benefits that would have previously been recognized in additional paid-in capital. Additionally, excess tax benefits should be classified, along with other income tax cash flows, as an operating activity rather than a financing activity, as was previously the case. ASU 2016-09 also provides that an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. ASU 2016-09 changes the threshold to qualify for equity classification (rather than as a liability) to permit withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates (rather than the minimum as was previously the case) in the applicable jurisdictions. ASU 2016-09 will be effective on January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  ASU No. 2016-10,     Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.   ASU 2016-10 was issued to clarify ASC Topic 606,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers    related to (i) identifying performance obligations; and (ii) the licensing implementation guidance. The effective date and transition of ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),    as discussed above. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-10 on its financial statements. 
    
  ASU No. 2016-13,    Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.    ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization s portfolio. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. ASU 2016-13 will be effective on January 1, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on its financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    ASU 2016-15 provides guidance related to certain cash flow issues in order to reduce the current and potential future diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a significant impact on its financial statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
    
  Sterling Bancorp (for purposes of this Item 2,  we,   our  and  us ) makes statements in this report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook or expectations for earnings, revenues, expenses and/or other financial, business or strategic matters regarding or affecting us that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intend,   outlook,   target,   estimate,   forecast,   project,  by future conditional verbs such as  will,   should,   would,   could  or  may,  or by variations of such words or by similar expressions.  These statements are not historical facts, but instead represent our current expectations, plans or forecasts and are based on the beliefs and assumptions of management and the information available to management at the time that these disclosures were prepared. 
    
  Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks (both known and unknown) and uncertainties, and other factors which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements. Because forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions, risks, uncertainties, and other factors, actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that we anticipated in our forward-looking statements, and future results could differ materially from our historical performance. 
    
  The factors described herein in Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors and in our 2015 Form 10-K under Item 1A. Risk Factors, or otherwise described in our filings with the SEC, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: 
             
    our ability to successfully implement strategic initiatives, to increase revenues faster than we grow expenses, and to integrate and fully realize cost savings and other benefits we estimate in connection with acquisitions; 
                
    a deterioration in general economic conditions, either nationally, internationally, or in our market areas, including extended declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets; 
                
    the Bank s total assets exceed $10 billion, which makes the Bank subject to regulatory oversight by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Bank became subject to provisions of the Durbin Amendment as of June 30, 2016, which will continue to impact the Bank s debit card interchange fees; 
                
    our ability to make accurate assumptions and judgments about an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses and the collectability of our loan portfolio, including changes in the level and trend of loan delinquencies and write-offs that may lead to increased losses and non-performing assets in our loan portfolio, result in our allowance for loan losses not being adequate to cover actual losses, and/or require us to materially increase our reserves; 
                
    our ability to manage changes in market interest rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; 
                
    our use of estimates in determining fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; 
                
    the effects of and changes in laws and regulations (including laws and regulations concerning banking and taxes) with which we and the Bank must comply; and 
                
    our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing and managing our business. 
       
  These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. 
    
  The following commentary presents Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations.  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and with our audited consolidated financial statements, including the accompanying notes, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2015 Form 10-K.  Operating results discussed herein are not necessarily indicative of the results of any future period.   
    
  Tax equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-exempt securities by an amount equal to the federal taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a 35.0% marginal effective income tax rate.

    STERLING BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Overview and Management Strategy 
  We, through our principal subsidiary, the Bank, specialize in the delivery of services and solutions to business owners, their families and consumers within the communities we serve through teams of dedicated and experienced relationship managers. The Bank offers a complete line of commercial, business and consumer banking products and services. Our financial condition and results of operations are discussed herein on a consolidated basis with the Bank and certain other subsidiaries. References to we, our or us include the Bank, depending on the context. 
    
  We focus our efforts on generating core deposit relationships and originating high-quality commercial, commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and consumer loans, mainly for our held-for-investment portfolio. We also utilize excess funding to purchase and hold investment securities. Our ability to gather low-cost core deposits allows us to compete for and originate loans at an interest rate spread over our cost of funds and thereby generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our strategic objectives include generating sustainable growth in revenues and earnings by increasing new client acquisitions, expanding existing client relationships, maintaining strong asset quality and increasing operating efficiency. To achieve these goals, we are focusing on specific target markets, which include small and middle market commercial clients and consumer clients, expanding our delivery and distribution channels, creating a high productivity performance culture, controlling our operating costs and proactively managing enterprise risk. Our goal is to create a full service commercial bank that achieves top-tier performance in return on equity, return on assets and growth in earnings per share. 
    
  The Bank targets the following geographic markets: (i) the New York Metro Market, which includes Manhattan, the boroughs and Long Island; and (ii) the New York Suburban Market, which consists of Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, Ulster, Putnam, and Westchester counties in New York and Bergen County, New Jersey. Our commercial finance businesses, which include asset-based lending, payroll finance, warehouse lending, factoring, and equipment financing also generate loans and deposits in other markets across the United States. We believe the Bank operates in an attractive footprint that presents us with significant opportunities to execute our strategy.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had 29 commercial banking teams and 41 financial centers. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we continued our financial center consolidation strategy and closed 12 locations. In addition, on August 15, 2016, we sold our residential mortgage originations business to Freedom Mortgage Corporation. We recorded a $2,000 pre-tax loss on the sale related to severance, fixed asset impairments and facilities closures.  We will re-allocate a portion of the capital and resource savings from these consolidations and divestiture to continue recruiting and hiring new commercial banking teams to execute our differentiated, single point of contact distribution strategy to our core target of small and middle market commercial and consumer clients. We anticipate that we will continue to grow our number of commercial relationship teams by three to five teams annually and will continue to reduce our financial center locations through additional consolidations over time.  
    
  Recent Developments 
  We had strong operating performance in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as portfolio loans, total deposits, and core deposits reached all-time highs. Our GAAP net income was   $37,422  , or   $0.29   per diluted share and our adjusted net income was   $37,793  , or   $0.29   per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to GAAP net income of   $24,193  , or   $0.19   per diluted share and adjusted net income of   $32,035  , or   $0.25   per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Results for the third quarter and the first nine months of   2016   reflect the ongoing execution of our strategy and the positive impact that the integration of the HVB Merger and other acquisitions have had on our operating results and efficiency. For the third quarter of 2016, our as reported operating efficiency ratio was   51.0%   and our adjusted operating efficiency ratio was   45.8%  , which represented an improvement of   1,260   and   320   basis points, respectively,  relative to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted operating efficiency ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results beginning on page 73.  
    
  We continuously evaluate the performance of our business lines to determine where we should allocate our capital and resources.  In the first quarter of 2016, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to divest our trust operations.  The divestiture process remains on-track, and we anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2016.  We will reallocate capital and resources from this business to other businesses that are more consistent with our diversified commercial banking strategy and where we can achieve risk-adjusted returns that exceed our targets. 
    
  Although we continue to originate commercial real estate loans, growth in this portfolio has decelerated in the last 12 months as management has deemphasized this asset class mainly due to market pricing and the competitive environment.  Total commercial mortgages (which includes commercial real estate, multi-family and ADC loans), grew   $391,293   and were   $4,107,072  , or   44.8%  , of our portfolio loans as of September 30, 2016, compared to   $3,715,779  , or   47.3%   of our portfolio loans as of December 31, 2015.  Given our ability to originate assets across diverse business lines, we have focused on growing our commercial loans; total C I loans, including our commercial finance loans, have grown   $966,739   and were   $4,097,767  , or   44.7%   of our portfolio loans as of September 30, 2016, compared to   $3,131,028  , or   39.8%  , of our portfolio loans as of December 31, 2015.  At September 30, 2016,  
  
   55 

    STERLING BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES 

we have a balanced loan portfolio that consists of ~45% of C I loans and ~45% of commercial mortgage loans.  Our objective is to  ontinue originating and acquiring loans across diverse asset classes, and maintain this balance over time.  
    
  We continue to focus on leveraging our commercial lending platforms and expertise; during the third quarter of 2016, we acquired   $163,282   (as of September 30, 2016) of restaurant franchise financing loans from GE Capital. Borrowers within the acquired portfolio are primarily located in our target markets of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.  We acquired this portfolio at a price of 96% of the unpaid principal balance, and the expected portfolio yield is approximately 7.0%.  
    
  On September 2, 2016, the Bank sold an additional   $65,000   Subordinated Notes.  In total, the Bank issued   $175,000   of subordinated notes between the March 2016 and September 2016 offerings.  The Subordinated Notes are identical to the terms of the March offering, except for the date of settlement and the offering price. The Subordinated Notes sold in September were sold to investors at a premium of   0.50%  ; The Company received net proceeds of $64,238 in the reopening.  At   September 30, 2016  , the total net unamortized discount on all issuances was   $2,551  , which will be accreted to interest expense over the life of the Subordinated Notes, resulting in an effective yield of   5.45%  .  Interest is due semi-annually on all issuances in arrears on   April 1   and   October 1   of each year, beginning on   October 1, 2016  , until   April 1, 2021  .  From and including   April 1, 2021  , the Subordinated Notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR plus   3.937%  , payable quarterly on   January 1  ,   April 1  ,   July 1   and   October 1   of each year, beginning on   July 1, 2021  , through maturity on   April 1, 2026   or earlier redemption. The subordinated notes are redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on April 1, 2021 and each interest payment date thereafter, as well as in whole at any time upon the occurrence of certain specified events. The Subordinated Notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of the Bank and are subordinated in right of payment to all of the Bank s existing and future senior indebtedness, including claims of depositors and general creditors. The Subordinated Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.  See Note 15.  Stockholders  Equity  for additional information regarding the Subordinated Notes and the Company s capital structure. 
    
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we redeemed   $23,000   of our Senior Notes and incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $1,013  , which is included in non-interest expense in the consolidated income statements.  The Senior Notes, of which $77,000 remain outstanding, mature on July 2, 2018. The redemption will reduce interest expense, and was funded with excess cash held at Sterling Bancorp.  
    
  On March 31, 2016, we completed the NSBC Acquisition. The NSBC Acquisition is consistent with our strategy of expanding our specialty commercial lending businesses, and it doubled the size of our asset-based lending portfolio.  The transaction met all of our acquisition criteria; (i) it is expected to be accretive to earnings per share; (ii) it has an estimated internal rate of return of greater than 20%; and (iii) it has a tangible book value earn-back period of less than 2.5 years. In addition, all of the loans acquired in the NSBC Acquisition are floating rate and yield over 5.00%. We will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions of specialty commercial lending businesses and loan portfolios that complement our existing businesses. We anticipate the full integration of NSBC into our existing asset-based lending operations will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  On March 31, 2016, we redeemed   $220,000   of fixed rate FHLB borrowings with a weighted average rate of   4.17%  .  As a result of consistent growth in our short-term floating rate asset classes, which was further accelerated by the NSBC Acquisition, we have substantially increased the asset sensitivity profile of our balance sheet.  To manage our asset and liability position, we repaid these fixed rate advances and replaced them with deposits and short-term and overnight FHLB borrowings, which we believe will provide us with greater balance sheet flexibility in the current interest rate environment. We incurred a charge on extinguishment of debt associated with these repayments of   $8,716  , which is included in non-interest expense in the consolidated income statements. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our accounting and reporting policies are prepared in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain; and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements. Accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses, business combinations, goodwill, trade names and other intangible assets, deferred income taxes, and interest income are considered to be critical, as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. For additional information regarding critical accounting policies, refer to Note 1.  Basis of Financial Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the sections captioned  Critical Accounting Policies  and  Allowance for Loan Losses  in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2015 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes in our application of critical accounting policies for the quarter and the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Financial Impact of Recent Acquisitions 
  The balances of HVHC were included in our balance sheet as of   June 30, 2015  , and the operating results of HVHC were included in our results of operations from that day forward. Therefore, comparisons of our financial performance are impacted by the HVB Merger, as our results from operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflect our combined operations, while our results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   include HVHC s operating results only for the period June 30, 2015 through September 30, 2015. 
    
  The balances of NSBC were included in our balance sheet as of   March 31, 2016  , and the operating results of NSBC were included in our results of operations from that day forward. 
    
  Results of Operations 
  We reported net income of   $37,422  , or   $0.29   per diluted common share, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net income of   $24,193  , or   $0.19   per diluted common share, in the same period a year ago. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we reported net income of   $98,958  , or   $0.76   per diluted common share, compared to net income of   $33,322  , or   $0.32   per diluted common share, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Results for the first nine months of 2015 included merger-related expense and other restructuring charges incurred in connection with the HVB Merger. 
    
  In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we realized a pre-tax net gain on the sale of securities of   $3,433  ,   a pre-tax loss recorded on extinguishment of debt of     $1,013     resulting from the repurchase of $23,000 of the Senior Notes; a pre-tax restructuring charge recorded in connection with the divestiture of our residential mortgage originations business of     $2,000  ;     and amortization of non-compete agreements and acquired customer list intangibles of   $970  . In the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred a pre-tax charge of   $13,384   related to the termination of the defined benefit pension plan (see Note 12.  Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans  to the consolidated financial statements for additional details); amortization of non-compete agreements and acquired customer list intangible assets of   $961  ; and realized a pre-tax net gain on the sale of securities of   $2,726  .  
    
  Details of the changes in the various components of net interest income are further discussed below. 
    
  Net Interest Income   is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue, representing   84.4%   and   83.2%   of total revenue in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Net interest margin is the ratio of taxable equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin. 
    
  We are primarily funded by core deposits.  Core deposits include retail, commercial and municipal transaction, money market and savings accounts and exclude certificates of deposit and brokered deposits except for reciprocal brokered deposits through the Promontory Interfinancial Network, including Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS ) and CDARs balances. As of   September 30, 2016  , we considered   88.3%   of our total deposits to be core deposits compared to   92.6%  , in the same period a year ago.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we established a relationship with a large financial services company that provides us access to brokered interest bearing deposits.  As a result, we utilized these brokered deposits in lieu of borrowings to fund a portion of the balance sheet growth that occurred in the third quarter.  Non-interest bearing demand deposits were   32.8%   of our total deposits at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   35.5%   at   September 30, 2015  . This low cost funding base has had a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin and is expected to continue to do so as we execute our diversified commercial banking strategy.   
    
  The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.

   3       Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the tax equivalent yield on average interest earning assets and the cost of average interest bearing liabilities. 
   4       Net interest earning assets represents total interest earning assets less total interest bearing liabilities. 
    
  The following tables present the dollar amount of changes in interest income (on a fully tax equivalent basis) and interest expense for the major categories of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. Information is provided for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (  i.e.,   changes in average balances multiplied by the prior period average rate); and (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (  i.e.,   changes in average rate multiplied by prior period average balances). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.

  Tax equivalent net interest income increased   $11,704   to   $106,765   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to  
  $95,061   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was mainly due to an increase in average interest earning assets of   $1,977,007  , or   19.7%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   relative to the prior year period.  The increase was driven by organic growth and the NSBC Acquisition.  The tax equivalent net interest margin declined   23   basis points to   3.53%   for the   third   quarter of   2016   from   3.76%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The yield on interest earning assets was   4.03%   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , which was a decline of 12 basis points compared to   4.15%   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , mainly due to a decrease in the yield on loans.  The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased to   0.74%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.63%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was due to higher interest rates paid on deposits during the period and the aggregate issuance of $175,000 of Subordinated Notes at the Bank in the first nine months of 2016. 
    
  Tax equivalent net interest income increased   $85,299   to   $305,905   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to  
  $220,606   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase was mainly due to an increase in average interest earning assets of   $3,446,408  , or   42.9%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   relative to the comparable year period.  The increase was mainly due to the HVB Merger, organic growth and the NSBC Acquisition.  The tax equivalent net interest margin decreased   11   basis points to   3.56%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   3.67%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in the tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets, which was   4.04%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   4.10%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased to   0.72%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   0.64%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , mainly due to the issuance of the Subordinated notes in the first nine months of 2016.  
    
  The average balance of loans outstanding increased   $1,412,949  , or   19.3%  , in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to the organic loan growth generated by our commercial banking teams and the NSBC Acquisition. Loans accounted for   72.8%   of average interest earning assets in the three  
  
   63 

    STERLING BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES 

months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   73.0%   in the comparable year ago period.  The average yield on loans was   4.57%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   4.75%   in the comparable year ago period as the lower interest rate environment has impacted our yield on loan originations.  Accretion income on loans from prior acquisitions was   $4,381   and   $5,756   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
    
  The average balance of loans outstanding increased   $2,478,949  , or   42.8%  , in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to the HVB Merger, organic loan growth generated by our commercial banking teams and the NSBC Acquisition. Loans accounted for   72.0%   of average interest earning assets in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , unchanged from the comparable year ago period.  The average yield on loans was   4.62%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   4.68%   in the comparable year ago period.  Accretion income on loans from prior acquisitions was   $13,940   and   $7,790   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
    
  Tax equivalent interest income on securities increased   $4,266   to   $20,256   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $15,990   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This was mainly the result of an increase of   $523,233   in the average balance of securities between the periods, as we increased the total amount and proportion of tax exempt securities between the periods.  The tax equivalent yield on securities was   2.74%   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   2.63%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increase in tax equivalent yield on securities in   2016   was primarily due to a higher percentage of tax exempt securities to total securities held in the   third   quarter of 2016.  
    
  Tax equivalent interest income on securities increased   $17,019   to   $57,934   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $40,915   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This was mainly the result of an increase of   $821,092   in the average balance of securities between the periods, which was due to the HVB Merger and an increase in tax exempt securities and taxable securities acquired between the periods.  The tax equivalent yield on securities was   2.72%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   2.70%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in tax equivalent yield on securities in   2016   was primarily due to the increase in the percentage of tax exempt securities to total securities, as described above.  
    
  Average deposits increased   $1,223,586   to   $9,915,494   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $8,691,908   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Average interest bearing deposits increased   $1,261,832   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . Average non-interest bearing deposits declined   $38,246   to   $3,196,204   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3,234,450   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in interest bearing deposits was mainly attributable to organic growth driven by our commercial banking teams and new commercial team hires. The average cost of interest bearing deposits was   0.54%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   0.39%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The average cost of total deposits was   0.37%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   0.24%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increase in the cost of deposits was mainly due to our increasing proportion of commercial deposits as described above. 
    
  Average deposits increased   $2,895,264   and were   $9,466,350   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6,571,086   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Average interest bearing deposits increased   $1,908,588   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Average non-interest bearing deposits increased   $986,676   and were   $3,088,678   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2,102,002   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . These increases were mainly due to the HVB Merger and organic growth generated by our commercial banking teams. The average cost of interest bearing deposits was   0.50%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   0.35%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The average cost of total deposits was   0.34%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   0.24%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in the cost of deposits was mainly due to an increasing proportion of commercial deposits relative to consumer deposits, as commercial deposits usually have higher interest rates paid and are more sensitive to changes in interest rates.  
    
  Average borrowings increased   $551,224   to   $1,324,001   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $772,777   in the same period a year ago.  The increase in average borrowings was mainly due to the increase in average loan balances due to organic growth and the NSBC Acquisition. The average cost of borrowings was   1.75%   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   2.38%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The decline in the average cost of borrowings was mainly due to the extinguishment of higher cost FHLB advances, which occurred in March 2016.  See Note 8.  Borrowings  in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information). 
    
  Average borrowings increased   $313,922   to   $1,301,099   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $987,177   in the same period a year ago.  The increase in average borrowings was mainly due to the increase in average loan balances due to the HVB Merger, organic growth and the NSBC Acquisition. The average cost of borrowings was   1.80%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   1.95%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decline in the average cost of borrowings was due to the same factors discussed above.

Provision for Loan Losses.   The provision for loan losses is determined as the amount to be added to the allowance for loan losses after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level that is our best estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the outstanding loan portfolio.  In the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the provision for loan losses was   $5,500   and   $5,000  , respectively. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the provision for loan losses was   $14,500   and   $10,200  , respectively.  The change in provision for loan losses in 2016 and 2015 was mainly due to organic loan growth and to offset net charge-offs. See the section captioned  Delinquent Loans, Troubled Debt Restructuring, Impaired Loans, Other Real Estate Owned and Classified Assets - Provision for Loan Losses  later in this discussion for further analysis of the provision for loan losses. 
    
  Non-interest income.   The components of non-interest income were as follows for the periods presented below: 

Non-interest income was   $19,039   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $18,802   in the same period a year ago.  Included in non-interest income is net gain on sale of securities, which was   $3,433   and   $2,726   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Net gain on sale of securities is impacted significantly by changes in market interest rates and strategies we use to manage yield, liquidity and interest rate risk, and it is difficult to forecast the amount of net gains consistently. As a result, when we analyze the results of our non-interest income, we exclude gains and losses on sales of securities. Excluding net gain on sale of securities, non-interest income was   $15,606   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $16,076   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The main driver of the decline between the periods was the sale of our residential mortgage originations business on August 15, 2016, which caused a decline of $1,803 in mortgage banking income between the periods. 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , total non-interest income was   $54,911   compared to   $46,668   for the same period a year ago.  Included in non-interest income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $7,624   of net gain on sale of securities compared to   $4,958   for the comparable year ago period.  Excluding net gain on sale of securities, non-interest income was   $47,287   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $41,710   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase between the periods was mainly due to higher other non-interest income, which includes loan swap fees and loan fees associated with the NSBC Acquisition; continued growth in accounts receivable management / factoring commissions and other related fees generated by our payroll finance and factoring businesses; and an increase in BOLI income.  The increase in BOLI income was  due to the HVB Merger.  Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in mortgage banking income of $3,121, which was due to the factors discussed above.  
    
  The ratio of non-interest income excluding securities gains and losses to tax equivalent net interest income plus non interest income excluding securities gains and losses was   12.8%   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   14.7%   for the third quarter of 2015. We expect this ratio will decrease further once we complete the pending sale of our trust division (expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016), and realize the full impact of the sale of our residential mortgage origination business. We anticipate this decrease will be partially offset by continued increases in other loan fees from the NSBC Acquisition, loan swap fees, other fee income generated by our commercial banking teams, syndication fees and deposit fees and service charges driven by commercial cash/treasury management services. We continue to evaluate potential acquisitions of specialty commercial lending and other businesses that are also fee income generators. 
    
  Accounts receivable management / factoring commissions and other related fees   represents fees generated in our factoring and payroll finance businesses.  In factoring, we receive a nonrefundable factoring fee, which is generally a percentage of the factored receivables or sales volume and is designed to compensate us for the bookkeeping and collection services provided and, if applicable, the credit review of the client s customer and assumption of customer credit risk.  In payroll finance, we provide

outsourcing support services for clients in the temporary staffing industry.  We generate fee income in exchange for providing full back-office, payroll, tax and accounting services to independently-owned temporary staffing companies.  Total fee income in these businesses increased   $137  , or   2.9%  , to   $4,898   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $4,761   for the year ago period.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , these fees were   $13,548  , compared to   $12,698   for the same period a year ago, an increase of 6.7% between the periods.  The increase was mainly attributable to the acquisitions of Damian and FCC, which are discussed in Note 2.  Acquisitions  in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.  These acquisitions were completed in the first half of 2015. 
    
  Mortgage banking income   represents the residential mortgage banking and mortgage brokerage business conducted through loan production offices located principally in Brooklyn, Great Neck and New York City and through our financial centers.  Mortgage banking income was   $1,153   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $2,956   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , mortgage banking income was   $5,522  , compared to   $8,643   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . In the second quarter of 2016, we sold $43,380 of residential mortgage loans acquired in the HVB Merger that were previously held as portfolio loans.  In the first nine months of 2015, we sold   $44,020   of residential mortgage loans that were previously held as portfolio loans with the objective of rebalancing our earning assets prior to the HVB Merger.  We recorded a gain on these loan sales of $607 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $390 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which were included in mortgage banking income. Mortgage banking income decreased in the third quarter of 2016 due to the sale of our residential mortgage originations business in August 2016.   
    
  Deposit fees and service charges   were   $3,407   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , which represented a   $1,043   decline compared to   $4,450   for the same period a year ago. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , deposit fees and service charges were   $11,981  , which represented an increase of   $353   compared to the same period a year ago.  Effective July 1, 2016, the Bank became subject to specific provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the Durbin Amendment, given the Bank s consolidated total assets were in excess of $10 billion.  As a result, the Bank s interchange fee earned on debit card transactions, which is part of deposit fees and services charges, was reduced to comply with the provisions of the Durbin Amendment; this decreased deposit fees and service charges between the periods.  The increase in deposit fees and service charges in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nne months ended September 30, 2015 was a result of the HVB Merger.  
    
  Deposits gathered by our commercial banking teams are generally higher balance deposits but generate lower levels of fees and service charges than retail deposits.  Although we anticipate generating greater cash/treasury management services income in the future, as the proportion of deposits generated by our commercial teams increases as a percentage of total deposits, the percentage of deposit fees and services charges to total deposits is likely to continue to decrease. 
    
  Net gain on sale of securities   income represents gains earned on the sale of securities from our available for sale investment securities portfolio. We realized a net gain on sale of securities of   $3,433   and   $2,726   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. We realized a net gain of sale of securities of   $7,624   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $4,958   for the same period a year ago.  Net gain on sale of securities in 2016 were driven by changes in the fair value of our securities portfolio due to changes in market interest rates.  In 2016, we decided to sell securities with net unrealized gains to reposition our securities portfolio and increase our holdings of municipal securities. In 2015, net gain on sale of securities was the result of the low interest rate environment and the repositioning of our securities portfolio prior to completion of the HVB Merger.  
    
  Bank owned life insurance ( BOLI )   income represents the change in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies owned by us.  BOLI income was   $1,891   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   $4,499   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,293   and   $3,443   in the same periods a year ago, respectively.  The increase in BOLI income between the periods was mainly due to BOLI assets acquired in the HVB Merger.  
    
  Investment management fees   historically represent fees from the sale of mutual funds and annuities; since the HVB Merger investment management fees also include trust fees.  These revenues were   $1,086   in the   third   quarter of   2016   and   $3,144   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $844   and   $1,520   in the same periods a year ago, respectively.  The increase was mainly due to the HVB Merger which increased trust fees. Trust fee income was $776 in the third quarter of 2016 and $2,041 in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  We will not continue to generate trust fee income once the sale of our trust division is completed, which is anticipated to occur by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  Other non-interest income   principally includes miscellaneous loan fees earned, letter of credit fees, loan swap fees and safe deposit rentals. Other non-interest income increased   $1,399   to   $3,171   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , from   $1,772   for the same period a year ago. Other non-interest income was   $8,593   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3,778   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the year earlier period was mainly due to the NSBC Acquisition and higher loan swap fees.

Non-interest expense.   The components of non-interest expense were as follows for the periods presented below: 

Non-interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $62,256  , a   $9,059   decrease compared to   $71,315   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decline was mainly the result of the defined benefit plan termination charge incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2015.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , non-interest expense was   $190,827  , a decrease of   $12,071   compared to   $202,898   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease between the periods was mainly due to a decrease in merger-related expense and charges incurred as a result of the HVB Merger and the defined benefit plan termination charge, which were both one-time expenses. Changes in the components of non-interest expense are discussed below.  
    
  Compensation and employee benefits expense   was   $32,501   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $29,238   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compensation and employee benefits expense was   $93,857   compared to   $75,070   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   The year-over-year increase in compensation and employee benefits expense was a result of the increase in the total number of employees resulting from the HVB Merger and NSBC Acquisition. At March 31, 2015, which was the quarter immediately prior to the HVB Merger, we had 840 full-time equivalent employees ( FTEs ). Upon the completion of the HVB Merger on June 30, 2015, we had 1,196 FTEs. Over the past five quarters we have integrated HVHC s operations, which has resulted in substantial efficiency gains.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total FTEs were 995.  We anticipate further FTE reductions as we complete the sale of our trust division in the fourth quarter of 2016 and from future financial center consolidations.  
    
  Stock-based compensation plan expense   was $  1,673   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $1,064   in the   third   quarter of 2015. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , stock-based compensation plan expense was   $4,960   compared to   $3,300   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in stock-based compensation plan expense between the periods is due to a greater percentage of compensation paid to our executive management and senior personnel in stock awards so as to better align the interests of management employees to those of our stockholders and the increase in personnel as a result of the HVB Merger and NSBC Acquisition. Stock-based compensation was granted in the first quarter of 2016 for calendar year 2015 performance. For additional information related to our employee benefit plans and stock-based compensation, see Note 11.  Stock-Based Compensation  in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
    
  Occupancy and office operations expense   was   $8,021   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $9,576   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The decrease between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2015 was due to a reduction in expense associated with consolidation of 18 financial centers that occurred between the periods.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had 41 financial center locations, compared to 59 financial centers at   September 30, 2015  .  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , occupancy and office operations expense was   $26,113  , compared to   $23,610   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase between the periods was mainly due to the facilities acquired in connection with the HVB Merger, which was partially offset by our continued consolidation of financial centers.

Amortization of intangible assets   mainly includes amortization of core deposit intangible assets, customer lists and non-compete agreements.  Amortization of intangible assets was   $3,241   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3,431   for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and was   $9,535   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6,611   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in amortization expense was due mainly to intangibles recorded in connection with the core deposits acquired in the HVB Merger.  We anticipate that the remaining expense associated with the Provident Merger non-compete agreements of $180 will fully amortize in the fourth quarter of 2016, and estimate amortization expense for the fourth quarter of 2016 will be $2,907. For additional information see Note 6.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
    
  FDIC insurance and regulatory assessments expense   was   $2,151   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $2,281   for the   third   quarter of   2015  ; and   $6,709   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $5,093   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase between the nine month periods was mainly due to the increase in our total assets as a result of our organic growth and the HVB Merger. In accordance with provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bank will be subject to greater FDIC premiums going forward, as banks with total assets of $10 billion or more are responsible for funding the increase from 1.15% to 1.35% in the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund. 
    
  Other real estate owned ( OREO ) expense   includes maintenance costs, taxes, insurance, write-downs (subsequent to any write-down at the time of foreclosure or transfer to OREO), and gains and losses from the disposition of OREO.  OREO includes real estate assets that have been foreclosed and financial center locations that have been closed and are held for sale. OREO expense was   $721   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $183   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , and   $1,844   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $187   in the prior year. OREO activity in the first   nine   months of 2016 included $582 of write-downs in the value of OREO, based on receipt of updated appraisals, and payment of property taxes of $1,186.  
    
  Merger-related expense   was   $0   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , and was   $265   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $17,079   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The amount in 2016 represented professional fees associated with the NSBC Acquisition. The amount in 2015 was incurred in connection with the HVB Merger and represented charges for financial advisory fees, legal and accounting fees, severance and retention, management change in control payments, insurance, public relations and communications, due diligence and other fees.  The amount incurred in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   also included merger-related expense of $1,790, related to the acquisition of Damian for legal fees, severance and retention, and fixed asset impairments.  
    
  Loss on extinguishment of borrowings expense   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $1,013  , compared to $  0   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  During the third quarter of 2016, we utilized excess liquidity to repurchase $23,000 of our outstanding Senior Notes.  In connection with the repurchase, we paid a premium to par and wrote-off the allocable portion of remaining unamortized issuance discount.  In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred a loss on extinguishment of borrowings of   $9,729   compared to $  0   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  In addition to the Senior Notes repurchase, we incurred a loss of   $8,716   due to the repayment of   $220,000   of fixed rate FHLB borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of   4.17%   during the first quarter of 2016.  These borrowings were replaced with deposits and short-term and overnight FHLB borrowings. 
    
  Charge for asset write-downs, banking systems conversion, retention and severance     was   $2,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $0   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , and was   $4,485   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $29,026   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The charges in 2016 were incurred in connection with the sale of the residential mortgage originations business, the NSBC Acquisition and the continued consolidation of financial centers and other locations.  The charges incurred in 2015 were mainly for asset write-downs associated with the consolidation of financial centers and other locations related to the HVB Merger, IT termination charges and retention and severance compensation. 
    
  Other non-interest expense   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $10,935  , compared to   $12,158   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , and was   $33,330   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $29,538   for the same period a year ago.  The decrease was mainly related to the sale of the residential mortgage originations business. See Note 13.  Other Non-Interest Expense  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for details on significant components. 
    
  Income Tax expense   was   $16,991   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $11,648   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , which represented an effective income tax rate of   31.2%   and   32.5%  , respectively.  Income tax expense was   $47,646   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and was   $16,043   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which represented an effective income tax rate of   32.5%   and   32.5%  , respectively.  Our effective tax rate differs from the 35% federal

statutory rate mainly due to the effect of tax exempt interest from public sector loans, municipal securities and BOLI income.  Due to our emphasis on growing public sector loans and municipal securities, total tax exempt earning assets increased to over $1.5 billion and represented 12.3% of our earning assets at   September 30, 2016  , compared to 4.9% at December 31, 2015. See Note 10.  Income Taxes  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. 
    
  Portfolio Loans 
  The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale, by type of loan at the periods indicated.   

Overview.   Total portfolio loans, net, increased   $1,300,121   to   $9,109,336   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $7,809,215   at   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , total C I loans comprised   44.7%   of the total loan portfolio, compared to   39.8%   at   December 31, 2015  .  Commercial mortgage loans comprised   44.8%   and   47.3%   of the total loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  C I loans increased $  966,739  , or   30.9%  , in the first nine months of   2016  .  This included   $162,013   of restaurant franchise financing loans acquired from GE Capital,   $320,447   of asset-based loans acquired in the NSBC Acquisition, and organic growth generated by our commercial banking teams, including organic growth in traditional C I loans of   $211,253  , growth in warehouse lending of   $198,586  , and growth in factored receivables of   $41,389  .  Partially offsetting the growth in these businesses was a decline of   $22,355   in equipment financing loans.  
    
  Included in total C I loans are asset-based lending, payroll finance, warehouse lending, factored receivables and equipment financing, which collectively comprise our commercial finance business and portfolio.  The commercial finance portfolio increased   $593,473   in the first nine months of 2016 and totaled   $2,353,011   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1,759,538   at   December 31, 2015  .  Approximately $320,447 of this growth was a result of loans acquired in the NSBC Acquisition. 
    
  Commercial mortgage loans increased   $391,293  , or   10.5%  , in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The main drivers of growth have been strong commercial real estate market conditions in the greater New York metropolitan area and higher origination volumes given our increased number of commercial banking teams. However, we anticipate that growth in the commercial mortgage loans will decrease, due to the pricing and competitive environment in the Company s target commercial real estate markets.

ADC loans, which is a component of commercial mortgage loans, increased   $25,498   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We have ceased originations of land acquisition and development loans; however, we do originate construction loans on an exception basis but only to select clients mostly within our immediate footprint. 
    
  Residential mortgage loans decreased   $40,681   to   $672,355   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $713,036   at   December 31, 2015  .  The majority of our residential mortgage loan originations were held for sale and sold in the secondary markets to various investors. We retain newly originated residential mortgage loans on an exception basis to select clients. The decline at   September 30, 2016   was due mainly to the sale of $43,380 of residential mortgage loans from our portfolio that were acquired in the HVB Merger.  We anticipate residential mortgage originations business volumes and portfolio balances will substantially decrease in the future, as we have completed the sale of our residential mortgage origination operation in the third quarter of 2016. Although the majority of such originations were sold in the secondary market, we often retained non-conforming prime residential mortgage loans in our portfolio.  
    
  Delinquent Loans, Troubled Debt Restructuring, Impaired Loans, Other Real Estate Owned and Classified Assets 
    
  Past Due, Non-Performing Loans, Non-Performing Assets (Risk Elements)  .   The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets ( NPAs ) at the dates indicated.  There were no asset-based lending and no warehouse lending loans that were non-performing at such dates. 

NPAs and NPLs.     NPLs include non-accrual loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more.  NPAs include NPLs and OREO.  At   September 30, 2016  , total NPLs increased   $14,656   to   $81,067   compared to   $66,411   at   December 31, 2015  .  This was due mainly to one taxi medallion relationship with a balance of $23,716 at   September 30, 2016  , which was placed on non-accrual during the first quarter of 2016. Non-accrual loans were   $77,794   and loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest which were well secured and in the process of collection were   $3,273  . Non-accrual loans increased   $12,057   from   December 31, 2015  . Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing increased   $2,599  .  
    
  TDRs.   TDRs still accruing interest income are loans modified for borrowers that have experienced financial difficulties but are performing in accordance with the terms of their loan prior to the modification. Loan modification concessions may include actions such as extension of the maturity date or the lowering of interest rates and monthly payments. Nearly all of these loans are secured by real estate. Total TDRs were   $16,395   at   September 30, 2016  , of which   $6,401   were non-accrual, none were 90 days past due and accruing, and   $9,994   were performing according to their terms and accruing interest income. Total TDRs were   $22,292   at December 31, 2015, of which   $8,591   were non-accrual, none were 90 days past due and accruing, and   $13,701   were performing according to their terms and accruing interest income.  The decline between the periods was mainly due to repayments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers with loans that have been classified as TDRs.

OREO.   Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as OREO until such time as it is sold.  In addition, financial centers that were closed or consolidated that are held for sale are also classified as OREO.  When real estate is transferred to OREO, it is recorded at fair value less costs to sell. If the fair value less cost to sell is less than the loan balance, the difference is charged against the allowance for loan losses. If the fair value of a financial center that we hold for sale is less than its prior carrying value, we recognize a charge included in other operating expense to reduce the recorded value of the investment to fair value, less costs to sell. At   September 30, 2016  , we had OREO properties with a recorded balance of   $16,422  , compared to a recorded balance of   $14,614   at December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly due to one residential loan to which we acquired title to during the second quarter of 2016. After transfer to OREO, we regularly update the fair value of the properties.  Subsequent declines in fair value are charged to current earnings and included in other non-interest expense as part of OREO expense.  
    
  Classification of Assets  .   Our policies, consistent with regulatory guidelines, provide for the classification of loans and other assets that are considered to be of lesser quality such as  substandard ,  doubtful , or  loss  assets. An asset is considered  substandard  if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Substandard  assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as  doubtful  have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as  substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as  loss  are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted and are charged-off. Assets that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but which possess potential weaknesses that deserve our close attention, are designated as  special mention .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $101,784   of loans designated as  special mention  compared to   $68,003   at   December 31, 2015  .  The increase was mainly due to $39,130 of loans acquired in the NSBC Acquisition that are performing but were designated as special mention loans under our underwriting methodology. 
    
  Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our loan loss allowance are subject to review by our regulators, which can order the establishment of an additional valuation allowance. Management regularly reviews our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of management s review of our assets at   September 30, 2016  , classified assets consisted of loans of   $113,483   and OREO of   $16,422  .  Classified loans were   $130,378   and OREO was   $14,614   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Taxi Medallion Loans 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $51,895  , or   0.57%  , of our total portfolio loans collateralized by taxi medallions compared to   $61,950  , or   0.79%  , at December 31, 2015. The decline in the balance between the periods was due to repayments.  One of our three taxi medallion borrower relationships in the amount of $23,716 is classified substandard and is on non-accrual at   September 30, 2016  . We continue to closely monitor the collateral values, cash flows and performance of each of these loans and are working with our borrowers to reduce these outstanding balances. 
    
  Allowance for Loan Losses  . 
  The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Our allowance for loan loss methodology includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310,    Receivables    and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450,    Contingencies.    Accordingly, the methodology is based on historical loss experience by type of credit and internal risk grade, specific homogeneous risk pools and specific loss allocations, with adjustments for current events and conditions. The Company s process for determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses is designed to account for credit deterioration as it occurs. The provision for loan losses reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of, and trends related to, non-accrual loans, past due loans, potential problem loans, classified and criticized loans and net charge-offs or recoveries and loan documentation exceptions, among other factors. See Note 5.  Allowance for Loan Losses  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information regarding the allowance for loan losses.  
    
  The allowance for loan losses increased from   $50,145   at   December 31, 2015   to   $59,405   at   September 30, 2016  , as the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge-offs by   $9,260  . The allowance for loan losses at   September 30, 2016   represented   73.3%   of non-performing loans and   0.65%   of total portfolio loans. At   December 31, 2015  , the allowance for loan losses represented   75.5%   of non-performing loans and   0.64%   of total portfolio loans. Loans acquired in prior merger transactions were recorded with a fair value adjustment as of the acquisition date that included estimated lifetime credit losses and interest rate adjustments, among other factors (the  loan mark ).  The remaining aggregate balance of the loan mark at   September 30, 2016   was   $41,516  .  A substantial portion of portfolio loans covered by the loan mark continue to carry no allowance for loan losses.  The total valuation balances recorded

against portfolio loans to adjusted gross portfolio loans was   1.10%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   1.16%   at December 31, 2015. See a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure on page 74. 
    
  Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses.   The following table sets forth the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan category, the total loan balances by category (excluding loans held for sale), and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated. The allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.  

Impaired Loans.   A loan is impaired when it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loan values are based on one of three measures: (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate; (ii) the loan s observable market price; or (iii) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the measure of an impaired loan is less than its recorded investment, the Bank s practice is to write-down the loan against the allowance for loan losses so the recorded investment matches the impaired value of the loan. Impaired loans generally include a portion of non-performing loans and accruing and performing TDR loans. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $59,428   in impaired loans compared to   $28,372   at   December 31, 2015  .  The increase in impaired loans between   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was mainly due to the $23,716 taxi medallion loan relationship discussed above.  
    
  PCI Loans.   A PCI loan is an acquired loan that has demonstrated evidence of deterioration in credit quality subsequent to origination. As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance of PCI loans was   $94,108  , compared to   $85,293   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to PCI loans acquired in the NSBC Acquisition, which were   $20,747   at September 30, 2016, and partially offset mainly by repayments of PCI loans from prior acquisitions and the transfer to OREO of a residential loan with a balance of $3,285.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held   $13,295   and   $20,025  , respectively, of PCI loans, which are accounted for under the cost-recovery method and were included in our non-accrual loan totals above. The decline between the periods was mainly due to the transfer to OREO of a $3,285 residential loan and a charge-off against the non-accretable difference established on a commercial real estate loan.  The remaining PCI loans of   $80,813   and   $65,268   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are accounted for under applicable guidance, which results in an accretable yield that represents the amount of expected cash flows that exceeds the initial investment in the loan. See the tables of loans evaluated for impairment by segment and changes in accretable yield for PCI loans in Note 4.  Portfolio Loans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.  
    
  Provision for Loan Losses.   We recorded   $5,500   in loan loss provision for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $5,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Net charge-offs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $1,960  , or   0.09%   of average loans on an annualized basis, compared to net charge-offs of   $1,706  ,or   0.09%  , of average loans on an annualized basis for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , provision for loan losses was   $14,500  , compared to   $10,200   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Net charge-offs for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $5,240  , or   0.08%   of average loans on an annualized basis, compared to net charge-offs of   $4,963  , or   0.11%   of average loans on an annualized basis for the comparable 2015 period.  The increase in the provision for loan losses between the periods was mainly due to organic growth in the loan portfolio, as well as loans from prior acquisitions that are now subject to our allowance for loan losses.

Changes in Financial Condition between   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015    
    
  Total assets increased   $1,661,276  , or   13.9%  , to   $13,617,228   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $11,955,952   at   December 31, 2015  .  This increase was mainly due to the following: 
       
  Total liabilities increased   $1,561,189  , or   15.2%  , to   $11,852,068   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $10,290,879   at   December 31, 2015  .  This increase was mainly due to the following: 
               
    On September 2, 2016, the Bank reopened the Subordinated Notes offering and issued additional notes in a principal amount of   $65,000  .  The Subordinated Notes issued September 2, 2016 are fully fungible with, rank equally in right of payment with, and form a singe series with the existing Subordinated Notes. In total, at September 30, 2016, there was   $175,000   of Subordinated Notes outstanding.  For more information, see  Recent Developments  in the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  section and Note 8.  Borrowings  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
       
  Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Results for the   third   quarter of 2016 were impacted by a pre-tax net gain on sale of securities of   $3,433  ; a pre-tax   loss recorded on extinguishment of     $1,013     as we repurchased     $23,000     of the Senior Notes due July 2018; a pre-tax restructuring charge recorded in connection with the divestiture of the residential mortgage originations business of     $2,000  ; and amortization of non-compete agreements and acquired customer list intangibles of   $970  . Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net income was   $37,793  , or   $0.29   per diluted share. 
    
  The non-GAAP financial measures presented below are used by our management and our Board of Directors on a regular basis in addition to our GAAP results to facilitate the assessment of our financial performance and to assess our performance compared to our annual budget and strategic plans.  These non-GAAP financial measures complement our GAAP reporting and are presented below to provide investors, analysts, regulators and others information that we use to manage and evaluate our performance each period. This information supplements our GAAP reported results, and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, our GAAP results.  Accordingly, this financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the 2015 Annual Report.

   1    Stockholders  equity as a percentage of total assets, book value per share, tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets and tangible equity per share provides information to help assess our capital position and financial strength.  We believe tangible book value measures improve comparability to other banking organizations that have not engaged in acquisitions that have resulted in the accumulation of goodwill and other intangible assets. 
    
   2    Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share present a summary of our earnings to exclude certain revenues and expenses (generally associated with discrete merger transactions and non-recurring strategic plans) to help in assessing our recurring profitability. 
    
   3    The reported operating efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing our GAAP non-interest expense by the sum of our GAAP net interest income plus GAAP non-interest income. The adjusted operating efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing non-interest expense adjusted for intangible asset amortization and certain expenses generally associated with discrete merger transactions and non-recurring strategic plans by the sum of net interest income plus non-interest income plus the

   5    Return on average tangible equity and the adjusted return on average tangible equity measures provide information to evaluate the use of our tangible equity. 
    
   6    The reconciliation of the allowance for loan losses and remaining purchase accounting adjustments to portfolio loans provides information to evaluate the impact of purchase accounting adjustments and the allowance for loan losses on our portfolio loans.  In purchase accounting, the prior allowance for loan losses is not carried over, and in place, we are required to estimate the fair value of the loan which includes an estimate of life of loan losses on the portfolio, which is included as a purchase discount within the acquired loan portfolio.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Capital.   Stockholders  equity was   $1,765,160   as of   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $100,087   relative to   December 31, 2015  .  The increase was mainly the result of net income of   $98,958   and an increase in other comprehensive income of   $20,017  , which was primarily due to a change in the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio as well as stock option exercises and stock-based compensation, which totaled   $8,355  .  These increases were partially offset by declared dividends of   $27,291  .  
    
  We paid dividends of $0.07 per common share in each quarter of 2015, and in the first three quarters of 2016, and the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.07 per common share on   October 25, 2016  , which is payable   November 21, 2016   to our holders as of the record date of   November 7, 2016  .  
    
  Basel III Capital Rules.   The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for us on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions). The rules are discussed in Note 15.  Stockholders  Equity - Regulatory Capital Requirements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
    
  Liquidity.   As discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K, our liquidity position is continuously monitored and we make adjustments to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic activity, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences. These scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. As of   September 30, 2016  , management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, including the Basel III liquidity framework, which, if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on us. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had   $376,053   in cash and cash equivalents on hand and unused borrowing capacity at the FHLB of   $1,304,179  . In addition, the Bank may purchase additional federal funds from other institutions and enter into additional repurchase agreements.  The Bank had   $872,734   of securities available to pledge as collateral as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Bank was required to maintain   $65,477   of cash on hand or on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank to meet regulatory reserve and clearing requirements at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We are a bank holding company and do not conduct operations.  Our primary sources of liquidity are dividends received from the Bank and borrowings from outside sources.  Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had capacity to pay up to   $115,012   of dividends. At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash on hand of   $14,689  . 
    
  On September 5, 2016, we renewed our $25,000 Credit Facility which is more fully described in Note 8.  Borrowings  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The use of proceeds are for general corporate purposes.  The Credit Facility has no outstanding balance and requires us and the Bank to maintain certain ratios related to capital, non-performing assets to capital, reserves to non-performing loans and debt service coverage.  We and the Bank were in compliance with all requirements at   September 30, 2016  .

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Management believes that our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. The general objective of our interest rate risk management is to determine the appropriate level of risk given our business strategy, and then manage that risk in a manner that is consistent with our policy to limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. The Bank s Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ), which consists of certain members of senior management, evaluates the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities, our operating environment, and capital and liquidity requirements, and modifies our lending, investing and deposit gathering strategies accordingly. A committee of our Board of Directors reviews ALCO s activities and strategies, the effect of those strategies on our net interest margin, and the effect that changes in market interest rates would have on the economic value of our loan and securities portfolios, as well as the intrinsic value of our deposits and borrowings. 
    
  We actively evaluate interest rate risk in connection with our lending, investing, and deposit activities. We emphasize the origination of commercial real estate loans, C I loans, residential fixed-rate mortgage loans that are repaid monthly and bi-weekly, and adjustable-rate residential and consumer loans. Depending on market interest rates and our capital and liquidity position, we may retain all of the fixed-rate, fixed-term residential mortgage loans that we originate or we may sell or securitize all, or a portion of such longer-term loans, generally on a servicing-released basis. We also invest in shorter term securities, which generally have lower yields compared to longer-term investments. Shortening the average maturity of our interest-earning assets by increasing our investments in shorter-term loans and securities may help us to better match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and liabilities, thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. These strategies may adversely affect net interest income due to lower initial yields on these investments in comparison to longer-term, fixed-rate loans and investments. 
    
  Management monitors interest rate sensitivity primarily through the use of a model that simulates net interest income ( NII ) under varying interest rate assumptions. Management also evaluates this sensitivity using a model that estimates the change in our and the Bank s economic value of equity ( EVE ) over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. The model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates that management believes is reasonable, based on historical experience during prior interest rate changes. 
    
  Estimated Changes in EVE and NII.   The table below sets forth, as of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated changes in our (i) EVE that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the forward rate curves; and (ii) NII that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied on as indicative of actual results. 

The table above indicates that at   September 30, 2016  , in the event of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would expect to experience a   (2.5)%   decrease in EVE and a   9.6%   increase in NII. Due to the current level of interest rates, management is unable to reasonably model the impact of decreases in interest rates on EVE and NII beyond -100 basis points. 
    
  Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE and NII require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The EVE and NII table presented above assumes that the composition of our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and, accordingly, the data does not reflect any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. The table also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or the re-pricing characteristics of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the EVE and NII table provides an indication of our sensitivity to interest rate  
  
   78 

    STERLING BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARIES 

changes at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes that market interest rates may have on our net interest income.  Actual results will likely differ. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, the federal funds target rate remained in a range of 0.25 - 0.50%. U.S. Treasury yields with the two year maturities decreased 29 basis points from 1.06% to 0.77% over the nine months ended September 30, 2016, while the yield on U.S. Treasury 10-year notes decreased 67 basis points from 2.27% to 1.60% over the same period. The greater decrease in rates on longer-term maturities relative to the decrease in rates on short-term maturities resulted in a flatter 2-10 year U.S. Treasury yield curve at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.  At its March 2016 meeting, the Federal Open Markets Committee (the  FOMC ) stated that its monetary policy remains accommodative.  The FOMC further stated that it expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate and the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.  However, should economic conditions improve at a faster pace than anticipated, the FOMC could increase the federal funds target rate quicker. This could cause the shorter end of the yield curve to rise disproportionately relative to the longer end, thereby resulting in an even flatter yield curve, which may result in greater margin compression. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
  The Company s management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Controls  
    
  There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

An employee of the Bank received shares of the Company s common stock in February 2016 as part of the purchase price associated with a small mortgage banking entity we acquired in 2014. These shares restricted the recipient from transfer for a period of time.  This employee was in the residential mortgage originations business which was sold and, as part of his separation agreement, the Company repurchased the restricted shares. 
    
  The Company announced its fifth repurchase program on December 17, 2009 authorizing the repurchase of 2,000,000 shares of which 776,713 remain available for repurchase.
