Note 1 Business and Organization 
    
  Business   iStar Inc. (the "Company"), doing business as "iStar," finances, invests in and develops real estate and real estate related projects as part of its fully-integrated investment platform. The Company has invested more than   $35 billion   over the past   two   decades and is structured as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") with a diversified portfolio focused on larger assets located in major metropolitan markets. The Company's primary business segments are real estate finance, land and development, net lease and operating properties (refer to Note 17).  
    
  Organization   The Company began its business in 1993 through the management of private investment funds and became publicly traded in 1998. Since that time, the Company has grown through the origination of new investments, as well as through corporate acquisitions. 

Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
  Basis of Presentation   The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10-01 of Regulation S-X for interim financial statements. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. These unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as amended on Form 10-K/A on   March 9, 2016   (the "  2015   Annual Report"). 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Such operating results may not be indicative of the expected results for any other interim periods or the entire year. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to conform to the   2016   presentation. 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company determined that its classification of common shares repurchased under its share repurchase programs should be classified as a reduction to common stock for the par amount of the common stock repurchased and additional paid in capital and included as shares unissued within the consolidated financial statements. The Company previously classified common shares repurchased under its share repurchase programs as treasury stock. The misclassification eliminates treasury stock and results in corresponding reductions of common stock and additional paid-in capital, which results in no change in total equity within the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of changes in equity. All repurchased shares previously reported as treasury stock will now be reported as unissued common stock. The change has no impact on the previously reported consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company evaluated the impact of this correction on previously issued financial statements and concluded they were not materially misstated. In order to conform previous financial statements with the current period, the Company elected to revise previously issued financial statements each time such financial statements are filed. The accompanying consolidated statements of changes in equity balances as of September 30, 2015 have been revised as follows:

     Table of Contents  
  iStar Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (unaudited) 

Principles of Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, controlled partnerships and variable interest entities ("VIEs") for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company's involvement with VIEs affects its financial performance and cash flows primarily through amounts recorded in "Operating lease income," "Interest income," "Earnings from equity method investments," "Real estate expense" and "Interest expense" in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company has not provided financial support to those VIEs that it was not previously contractually required to provide.       
  Consolidated VIEs   The Company consolidates VIEs for which it is considered the primary beneficiary. As of   September 30, 2016  , the total assets of these consolidated VIEs were   $414.9 million   and total liabilities were   $66.2 million  . The classifications of these assets are primarily within "Land and development" and "Real estate, net" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The classifications of liabilities are primarily within "Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The liabilities of these VIEs are non-recourse to the Company and can only be satisfied from each VIE's respective assets. The Company did not have any unfunded commitments related to consolidated VIEs as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Unconsolidated VIEs   The Company has investments in VIEs where it is not the primary beneficiary and accordingly the VIEs have not been consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's maximum exposure to loss from these investments does not exceed the sum of the   $80.6 million   carrying value of the investments, which are classified in "Other investments" and "Loans receivable and other lending investments, net" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, and   $45.8 million   of related unfunded commitments.  

Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ("ASU 2015-03") which modified the presentation of debt issuance costs as a deduction from the carrying value of "Debt obligations, net" and "Loan participations payable, net" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, which is consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. These costs were previously recorded in "Deferred expenses and other assets, net" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As a result, as of December 31, 2015, "Deferred expenses and other assets, net" excludes   $25.1 million   of debt issuance costs and "Debt obligations, net" and "Loan participations payable, net" are presented net of debt issuance costs of   $24.9 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively. Debt issuance costs associated with revolving-debt arrangements are recorded in "Deferred expenses and other assets, net" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ("ASU 2015-02") which modified the analysis it must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of entities. The guidance does not amend the existing disclosure requirements for VIEs or voting interest entities ("VOEs"). The guidance, however, modified the requirements to qualify under the VOE model. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2014-16,   Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to Debt or to Equity   ("ASU 2014-16") which eliminated the diversity in practice for the accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share. ASU 2014-16 requires management to consider all terms and features, whether stated or implied, of a hybrid instrument when determining whether the nature of the instrument is more akin to a debt instrument or an equity instrument. Embedded derivative features, which are accounted for separately from host contracts, should also be considered in the analysis of the hybrid instrument. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remainder of the Company's significant accounting policies, which are detailed in the Company's 2015 Annual Report, have not changed materially. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements     In August 2016  ,   the     Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15") which was issued to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, distributions from equity method investees, and other separately identifiable cash flows, are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (unaudited) 

December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. Management is evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016  ,   the     FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses:     Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ("ASU 2016-13") which was issued to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments held by a reporting entity. This amendment replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Management is evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016  ,   the     FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation:     Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09") which was issued to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not believe the guidance will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ("ASU 2016-02"), which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. For operating leases, a lessee will be required to do the following: (i) recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position; (ii) recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis and (iii) classify all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP. However, in certain instances a long-term lease of land could be classified as a sales-type lease, resulting in the lessor derecognizing the underlying asset from its books and recording a profit or loss on sale and the net investment in the lease. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management is evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall:     Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ("ASU 2016-01"), which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. Management is evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2014-09") which supersedes existing industry-specific guidance, including ASC 360-20,   Real Estate Sales  . The new standard is principles-based and requires more estimates and judgment than current guidance. Certain contracts with customers, including lease contracts and financial instruments and other contractual rights, are not within the scope of the new guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date  , to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. ASU 2014-09 is now effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted beginning January 1, 2017. Management is evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Note 4 Real Estate 
  The Company's real estate assets were comprised of the following ($ in thousands):  

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
     
  Real Estate Available and Held for Sale   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company transferred   one   net lease asset with a carrying value of   $0.7 million   and   one   commercial operating property with a carrying value of   $16.1 million   to held for sale due to executed contracts with third parties. The Company also acquired a residential operating property for   $0.8 million   that is held for sale and had no operations as of September 30, 2016. During the   nine months   ended September 30, 2015, the Company transferred net lease assets with a carrying value of   $8.2 million   to held for sale due to executed contracts with third parties and a commercial operating property with a carrying value of   $2.9 million   to held for investment due to a change in business strategy.  
    
  Acquisitions   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired land for   $3.9 million   and simultaneously entered into a   99   year ground lease with the seller. During the   nine months   ended September 30, 2015, the Company acquired, via deed-in-lieu, title to a residential operating property which had a total fair value of   $13.4 million   and previously served as collateral for loans receivable held by the Company. No gain or loss was recorded in connection with this transaction. 
  Dispositions   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company sold residential condominiums for total net proceeds of   $74.9 million   and   $113.4 million  , respectively, and recorded income from sales of real estate totaling   $23.3 million   and   $36.8 million  , respectively. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company sold net lease assets for net proceeds of   $108.5 million   and   $39.4 million  , respectively, resulting in gains of   $15.9 million   and   $15.6 million  , respectively. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company also sold commercial operating properties for net proceeds of   $229.1 million   resulting in gains of   $49.2 million  . The gains are recorded in "Income from sales of real estate" in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company sold a commercial operating property for   $68.5 million   to a newly formed unconsolidated entity in which the Company owns a   50.0%   equity interest (refer to Note 6). The Company recognized a gain on sale of   $13.6 million  , reflecting the Company's share of the interest sold, which was recorded as "Income from sales of real estate" in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  During the   nine months   ended September 30, 2015, the Company, through a consolidated entity, sold a leasehold interest in a commercial operating property for net proceeds of   $93.5 million   and simultaneously entered into a ground lease with an initial term of   99 years  .

included in "Deferred expenses and other assets, net" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, and deferred a gain of   $5.3 million  , which is included in "Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. In December 2015, the Company acquired the noncontrolling interest in the entity for   $6.4 million  .

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded impairments of   $5.6 million   resulting from a change in business strategy on   two   commercial operating properties and unfavorable local market conditions for   one   residential operating property. 
  Tenant Reimbursements   The Company receives reimbursements from tenants for certain facility operating expenses including common area costs, insurance, utilities and real estate taxes.

The Company's recorded investment in loans (comprised of a loan's carrying value plus accrued interest) and the associated reserve for loan losses were as follows ($ in thousands): 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    The carrying value of these loans include unamortized discounts, premiums, deferred fees and costs totaling net discounts of   $0.4 million   and   $0.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company's loans individually evaluated for impairment primarily represent loans on non-accrual status and therefore, the unamortized amounts associated with these loans are not currently being amortized into income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company transferred a loan with a gross carrying value of   $157.2 million   to non-performing loans due to the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings related to the collateral, which resulted in the release of   $11.6 million   of the general reserve. The Company performed a valuation and recorded a specific reserve of   $12.5 million  . 
              (2) 
    The carrying value of these loans include unamortized discounts, premiums, deferred fees and costs totaling net discounts of   $0.3 million   and   $8.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
        
  Credit Characteristics   As part of the Company's process for monitoring the credit quality of its loans, it performs a quarterly loan portfolio assessment and assigns risk ratings to each of its performing loans. Risk ratings, which range from 1 (lower risk) to 5 (higher risk), are based on judgments which are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that actual performance will be similar to current expectation. The Company designates loans as non-performing at such time as: (1) the loan becomes 90 days delinquent; (2) the loan has a maturity default; or (3) management determines it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. All non-performing loans are placed on non-accrual status and income is only recognized in certain cases upon actual cash receipt.

Troubled Debt Restructurings   During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company modified two loans that were determined to be troubled debt restructurings.  The Company restructured one non-performing loan with a recorded investment of   $5.8 million   to grant a maturity extension of one year. The Company also modified one non-performing loan with a recorded investment of   $11.6 million   to grant a discounted payoff option and a maturity extension of one year. The Company's recorded investment in these loans was not impacted by the modifications.  
  Generally when granting concessions, the Company will seek to protect its position by requiring incremental pay downs, additional collateral or guarantees and in some cases lookback features or equity kickers to offset concessions granted should conditions impacting the loan improve. The Company's determination of credit losses is impacted by troubled debt restructurings whereby loans that have gone through troubled debt restructurings are considered impaired, assessed for specific reserves, and are not included in the Company's assessment of general loan loss reserves. Loans previously restructured under troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default are reassessed to incorporate the Company's current assumptions on expected cash flows and additional provision expense is recorded to the extent necessary.

An undrawn credit facility commitment fee ranges from   0.375%   to   0.50%  , based on average utilization each quarter. During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average cost of the credit facility was   3.22%  . Commitments under the revolving facility mature in March 2018. At maturity, the Company may convert outstanding borrowings to a   one year   term loan which matures in quarterly installments through March 2019. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had   $250.0 million   of borrowing capacity available under the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility. 
  2012 Secured Credit Facilities   In March 2012, the Company entered into an   $880.0 million   senior secured credit agreement providing for   two   tranches of term loans: a   $410.0 million   2012 A-1 tranche due March 2016, which accrued interest at a rate of   LIBOR + 4.00%   (the "2012 Secured Tranche A-1 Facility"), and a   $470.0 million   2012 A-2 tranche due March 2017, which accrued interest at a rate of   LIBOR + 5.75%   (the "2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility," together the "2012 Secured Credit Facilities"). The 2012 A-1 and A-2 tranches were issued at   98.0%   of par and   98.5%   of par, respectively, and both tranches included a LIBOR floor of   1.25%  .  
    
  The 2012 Secured Tranche A-1 Facility was fully repaid in August 2013. In June 2016, proceeds from the 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility were used to repay in full the 2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , repayments of the 2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility prior to maturity resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of   $1.2 million   related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and unamortized deferred financing

fees on the portion of the facility that was repaid. During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , repayments of the 2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility prior to maturity resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively. These amounts are included in "Loss on early extinguishment of debt, net" in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Unsecured Notes   In March 2016, the Company repaid its   $261.4 million   principal amount of   5.875%   senior unsecured notes at maturity using available cash. In addition, the Company issued   $275.0 million   principal amount of   6.50%   senior unsecured notes due July 2021. Proceeds from the offering were primarily used to repay in full the   $265.0 million   principal amount of senior unsecured notes due July 2016 and repay   $5.0 million   of the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility. In September 2016, the Company repurchased and retired   $21.8 million   of its   1.50%   Convertible Notes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, repayments of unsecured notes prior to maturity resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively. This amount is included in "Loss on early extinguishment of debt, net" in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Encumbered/Unencumbered Assets   As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of the Company's encumbered and unencumbered assets by asset type are as follows ($ in thousands): 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
      
  Debt Covenants 
    
  The Company's outstanding unsecured debt securities contain corporate level covenants that include a covenant to maintain a ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness of at least   1.2  x and a covenant not to incur additional indebtedness (except for incurrences of permitted debt), if on a pro forma basis, the Company's consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, determined in accordance with the indentures governing the Company's debt securities, is   1.5  x or lower. If any of the Company's covenants are breached and not cured within applicable cure periods, the breach could result in acceleration of its debt securities unless a waiver or modification is agreed upon with the requisite percentage of the bondholders. While the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness under the fixed charge coverage ratio is currently limited, the Company is permitted to incur indebtedness for the purpose of refinancing existing indebtedness and for other permitted purposes under the indentures. 
    
  The Company's 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility and the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility contain certain covenants, including covenants relating to collateral coverage, dividend payments, restrictions on fundamental changes, transactions with affiliates, matters relating to the liens granted to the lenders and the delivery of information to the lenders. In particular, the 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain collateral coverage of at least   1.25  x outstanding borrowings on the facility. The 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a borrowing base of assets and requires the Company to maintain both collateral coverage of at least   1.5  x outstanding borrowings on the facility and a consolidated ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of at least   1.5  x. The 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility does not require that proceeds from the borrowing base be used to pay down outstanding borrowings provided the collateral coverage remains at least   1.5  x outstanding borrowings on the facility. To satisfy this covenant, the Company has the option to pay down outstanding borrowings or substitute assets in the borrowing base. In addition, for so long as the Company maintains its qualification as a REIT, the 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility and the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility permit the Company to distribute   100%   of its REIT taxable income

on an annual basis (prior to deducting certain cumulative net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards). The Company may not pay common dividends if it ceases to qualify as a REIT. 
    
  The Company's 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility and the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility contain cross default provisions that would allow the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate the Company's indebtedness to them if the Company fails to pay amounts due in respect of its other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds or if the lenders under such other indebtedness are otherwise permitted to accelerate such indebtedness for any reason. The indentures governing the Company's unsecured public debt securities permit the bondholders to declare an event of default and accelerate the Company's indebtedness to them if the Company's other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds is not paid at final maturity or if such indebtedness is accelerated. 
   
  Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Unfunded Commitments   The Company generally funds construction and development loans and build-outs of space in real estate assets over a period of time if and when the borrowers and tenants meet established milestones and other performance criteria. The Company refers to these arrangements as Performance-Based Commitments. In addition, the Company sometimes establishes a maximum amount of additional funding which it will make available to a borrower or tenant for an expansion or addition to a project if it approves of the expansion or addition in its sole discretion. The Company refers to these arrangements as Discretionary Fundings. Finally, the Company has committed to invest capital in several real estate funds and other ventures. These arrangements are referred to as Strategic Investments.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum amount of fundings the Company may be required to make under each category, assuming all performance hurdles and milestones are met under the Performance-Based Commitments, that it approves all Discretionary Fundings and that   100%   of its capital committed to Strategic Investments is drawn down, are as follows ($ in thousands):

           (1) 
    Excludes   $212.1 million   of commitments on loan participations sold that are not the obligation of the Company (refer to Note 9). 
       
  Legal Proceedings   The Company and/or one or more of its subsidiaries is party to various pending litigation matters that are considered ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Company's business as a finance and investment company focused on the commercial real estate industry, including loan foreclosure and foreclosure-related proceedings. In addition to such matters, the Company is a party to the following legal proceedings: 
    
  Shareholder Action 
  On March 7, 2014, a shareholder action purporting to assert derivative, class and individual claims was filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland naming the Company, a number of its current and former senior executives (including its chief executive officer) and current and former directors as defendants.  The complaint sought unspecified damages and other relief and alleged breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and other causes of action arising out of shares of common stock issued by the Company to its senior executives pursuant to restricted stock unit awards granted in December 2008 and modified in July 2011. The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the plaintiffs  claims, which the Circuit Court granted on October 30, 2014 and, as a result, all of plaintiffs' claims in this action were dismissed. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of their claims and, on January 28, 2016, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the order of the Circuit Court.  Plaintiffs then filed a petition for certiorari with the Maryland Court of Appeals, requesting that the decision of the Court of Special Appeals be reversed. On May 20, 2016, the Maryland Court of Appeals granted the petition for writ of certiorari and agreed to hear the appeal. Oral argument was held on October 7, 2016 and the Company is awaiting a decision from the Court of Appeals. 
    
  U.S. Home Corporation ("Lennar") v. Settlers Crossing, LLC, et al. (Civil Action No. DKC 08-1863) 
  On January 22, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland (the "Court") entered a judgment in favor of the Company in the matter of Lennar v. Settlers Crossing, LLC, et al. (Civil Action No. DKC 08-1863). The litigation involved a dispute over the purchase and sale of approximately   1,250   acres of land in Prince George s County, Maryland. The Court found that the Company was entitled to specific performance and awarded damages to it in the aggregate amount of: (i) the remaining purchase price to be paid by Lennar of   $114.0 million  ; plus (ii) interest on the unpaid amount at a rate of   12%   per annum, calculated on a per diem basis, from May 27, 2008, until Lennar proceeds to settlement on the land; plus (iii) real estate taxes paid by the Company; plus (iv) actual and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred by the Company in connection with the litigation. The Court ordered Lennar to proceed to settlement on the land and to pay the total amounts awarded to the Company within   30   days of the judgment. Lennar appealed the Court's judgment and has posted an appeal bond. The Court has granted Lennar's motion to stay the judgment pending appeal. The Court also clarified the judgment that the unpaid amount will accrue simple interest at a rate of   12%   annually, including while the appeal is pending. In the pending appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the parties have filed their respective briefs. Oral argument in the appeal, originally scheduled for October 26, 2016, has been continued by order of the Court of Appeals and will be rescheduled for the next available oral argument session. There can be no assurance as to the timing or actual receipt by the Company of amounts awarded by the Court or the outcome of the appeal. A third party purchased a participation interest in the Company's original loan and presently holds a   7.8%   participation interest in all proceeds. 
    
  On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates developments in legal proceedings that could require a liability to be accrued and/or disclosed. Based on its current knowledge, and after consultation with legal counsel, the Company believes it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any pending legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Note 12 Derivatives 
  The Company's use of derivative financial instruments is primarily limited to the utilization of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and foreign exchange contracts. The principal objective of such financial instruments is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with the Company's operating and financial structure and to manage its exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate movements, foreign exchange rate movements, and other identified risks, but may not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. 
  The table below presents the fair value of the Company's derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   ($ in thousands):

Foreign Exchange Contracts   The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on investments it holds in foreign entities. The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on its foreign investments. Foreign exchange contracts involve fixing the U.S. dollar ("USD") to the respective foreign currency exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The foreign exchange contracts are typically cash settled in USD for their fair value at or close to their settlement date.  
  For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. Amounts are reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into earnings when the hedged foreign entity is either sold or substantially liquidated. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following outstanding foreign currency derivatives that were used to hedge its net investments in foreign operations that were designated ($ and Rs in thousands): 

For derivatives not designated as net investment hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported in the Company's consolidated statements of operations within "Other Expense." As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following outstanding foreign currency derivatives that were used to hedge its net investments in foreign operations that were not designated ($,  , and   in thousands): 

The Company marks its foreign investments each quarter based on current exchange rates and records the gain or loss through "Other expense" in its consolidated statements of operations for loan investments or "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)," on its consolidated balance sheets for net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The Company recorded net gains (losses) related to foreign investments of   $0.1 million   during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $(0.1) million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 in its consolidated statements of operations.   
  Interest Rate Hedges   For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate swap that was used to hedge its variable rate debt that was designated as a cash flow hedge ($ in thousands):

For derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported in the Company's consolidated statements of operations within "Other Expense." As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate cap that was used to hedge its variable rate debt that was not designated as a cash flow hedge ($ in thousands):  

Over the next   12 months  , the Company expects that   $0.1 million   related to terminated cash flow hedges will be reclassified from "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" into interest expense and   $0.5 million   relating to other cash flow hedges will be reclassified from "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" into earnings. 
    
  Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features   The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company either defaults or is capable of being declared in default on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. 
    
  The Company reports derivative instruments on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. In connection with its foreign currency derivatives which were in a liability position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has posted collateral of   $0.8 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, and is included in "Deferred expenses and other assets, net" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company's net exposure under these contracts was   zero   as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Note 13 Equity 
    
  Preferred Stock   The Company had the following series of Cumulative Redeemable and Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Holders of shares of the Series D, E, F, G, I and J preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends, when and as declared by the Company's Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. Dividends are cumulative from the date of original issue and are payable quarterly in arrears on or before the 15th day of each March, June, September and December or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day. Any dividend payable on the preferred stock for any partial dividend period will be computed on the basis of a   360  -day year consisting of   twelve     30  -day months. Dividends will be payable to holders of record as of the close of business on the first day of the calendar month in which the applicable dividend payment date falls or on another date designated by the Company's Board of Directors for the payment of dividends that is not more than   30   nor less than   10   days prior to the dividend payment date. 
              (2) 
    The Company declared and paid dividends of   $6.0 million  ,   $8.3 million  ,   $5.9 million  ,   $4.6 million   and   $7.0 million   on its Series D, E, F, G and I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company declared and paid dividends of   $6.8 million   on its Series J Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . All 2015 dividends qualified as a return of capital for tax reporting purposes. There are   no   dividend arrearages on any of the preferred shares currently outstanding. 
              (3) 
    The Company may, at its option, redeem the Series D, E, F, G, and I Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for cash at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the liquidation preference of   $25.00   per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the redemption date. 
              (4) 
    Each share of the Series J Preferred Stock is convertible at the holder's option at any time, initially into   3.9087   shares of the Company's common stock (equal to an initial conversion price of approximately   $12.79   per share), subject to specified adjustments. The Company may not redeem the Series J Preferred Stock prior to March 15, 2018. On or after March 15, 2018, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Series J Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for cash at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the liquidation preference of   $50.00   per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the redemption date.

Dividends   To maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company must annually distribute, at a minimum, an amount equal to   90%   of its taxable income, excluding net capital gains, and must distribute   100%   of its taxable income (including net capital gains) to eliminate corporate federal income taxes payable by the REIT. The Company has recorded NOLs and may record NOLs in the future, which may reduce its taxable income in future periods and lower or eliminate entirely the Company's obligation to pay dividends for such periods in order to maintain its REIT qualification. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had   $902.9 million   of NOL carryforwards at the corporate REIT level that can generally be used to offset both ordinary taxable income and capital gain net income in future years. The NOL carryforwards will expire beginning in 2029 and through   2035   if unused. Because taxable income differs from cash flow from operations due to non-cash revenues and expenses (such as depreciation and certain asset impairments), in certain circumstances, the Company may generate operating cash flow in excess of its dividends, or alternatively, may need to make dividend payments in excess of operating cash flows. The 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility and 2015 Revolving Credit Facility permit the Company to distribute   100%   of its REIT taxable income on an annual basis (prior to deducting certain cumulative NOL carryforwards), as long as the Company maintains its REIT qualification. The 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility and 2015 Revolving Credit Facility restrict the Company from paying any common dividends if it ceases to qualify as a REIT. The Company did not declare or pay any common stock dividends for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Stock Repurchase Program   In February 2016, after having substantially utilized the remaining availability previously authorized, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new   $50.0 million   stock repurchase program. After having substantially utilized the availability authorized in February 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase to the stock repurchase program to   $50.0 million  , effective August 4, 2016. The program authorizes the repurchase of common stock from time to time in open market and privately negotiated purchases, including pursuant to one or more trading plans. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   10.2 million   shares of its outstanding common stock for   $98.4 million  , at an average cost of   $9.67   per share. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company repurchased   1.7 million   shares of its outstanding common stock for   $20.3 million  , at an average cost of   $12.16   per share. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase up to   $50.0 million   and   $48.7 million  , respectively, of common stock under its stock repurchase program.  
    
  HPU Repurchase   In August 2015, the Company repurchased and retired all of its   14,888   HPUs outstanding, representing approximately   2.8 million   common stock equivalents. The Company repurchased these HPUs at fair value from current and former employees through an arms-length tender offer. HPU holders could elect to receive   $9.30   in cash or   0.7   shares of iStar common stock, or a combination thereof, per common stock equivalent underlying the HPUs. Approximately   37%   of the outstanding HPUs were exchanged for   $9.8 million   in cash and approximately   63%   of the outstanding HPUs were exchanged for   1.2   million shares of iStar common stock with a fair value of   $15.2 million  , representing the number of shares issued at the closing price of the Company's common stock on August 13, 2015. The transaction value in excess of the HPUs carrying value of   $9.8 million   was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings in the Company's consolidated statements of changes in equity.

restricted stock units ("Units") that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting/service period of   1.8   years.  
  Performance Incentive Plans   The Company's Performance Incentive Plan ("iPIP") is designed to provide, primarily to senior executives and select professionals engaged in the Company's investment activities, long-term compensation which has a direct relationship to the realized returns on investments included in the plan. The fair value of points is determined using a model that forecasts the Company's projected investment performance. iPIP is a liability-classified award which will be remeasured each reporting period at fair value until the awards are settled.  The following is a summary of granted iPIP points. 
     In May 2014, the Company granted   73   iPIP points in the initial 2013-2014 investment pool. 
     As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued compensation costs relating to iPIP of   $20.3 million   and   $16.6 million  , respectively, which are included in "Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 
  Long-Term Incentive Plan   The Company's shareholders approved the Company's 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2009 LTIP") which is designed to provide incentive compensation for officers, key employees, directors and advisors of the Company. The 2009 LTIP provides for awards of stock options, shares of restricted stock, phantom shares, restricted stock units, dividend equivalent rights and other share-based performance awards. All awards under the 2009 LTIP are made at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , an aggregate of   3.6 million   shares remain available for issuance pursuant to future awards under the Company's 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
  Restricted Share Issuances   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   92,057   shares of common stock to certain employees under the 2009 LTIP as part of annual incentive awards that included a mix of cash and equity awards. The shares are fully-vested and   58,667   shares were issued net of statutory minimum required tax withholdings. The employees are restricted from selling these shares for up to   18 months   from the date of grant. 
  2016 Restricted Stock Unit Activity   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted new stock-based compensation awards to certain employees in the form of long-term incentive awards, comprised of the following: 
             
    20,000   fully-vested shares of the Company's common stock granted on June 15, 2016 and   12,030   shares were issued as of that date, after deducting shares for minimum required statutory withholdings. In addition,   80,000   service-based Units were granted on June 15, 2016, representing the right to receive an equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock (after deducting shares for minimum required statutory withholdings) if and when the Units vest. The Units will vest in equal annual installments over   four   years on each anniversary of the grant date, if the employee remains employed by the Company on the vesting date, subject to certain accelerated vesting rights. Upon vesting of these Units, the holder will receive shares of the Company's common stock in the amount of the vested Units, net of statutory minimum required tax withholdings. Dividends will accrue as and when dividends are declared by the Company on shares of its common stock, but will not be paid unless and until the Units vest and are settled. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   80,000   of such service-based Units were outstanding. 
                
    122,817   service-based Units granted on January 29, 2016, representing the right to receive an equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock (after deducting shares for minimum required statutory withholdings) if and when the Units vest. The Units will cliff vest in   one   installment on December 31, 2018, if the employee remains employed by the Company on the vesting date, subject to certain accelerated vesting rights. Dividends will accrue as and when dividends are declared by the Company on shares of its common stock, but will not be paid unless and until the Units vest and are settled. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   109,417   of such service-based Units were outstanding.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following additional stock-based compensation awards outstanding: 

40,030   target amount of performance-based Units granted on January 30, 2015, representing the right to receive an equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock (after deducting shares for minimum required statutory withholdings) if and when the Units vest. The performance is based on the Company's TSR, measured over a performance period ending on December 31, 2017, which is the date the awards cliff vest. Vesting will range from   0%   to   200%   of the target amount of the awards, depending on the Company s TSR performance relative to the NAREIT All REITs Index (one-half of the target amount of the award) and the Russell 2000 Index (one-half of the target amount of the award) during the performance period. The Company, as well as any companies not included in each index at the beginning and end of the performance period, are excluded from calculation of the performance of such index. To the extent Units vest based on the Company's TSR performance, holders will receive an equivalent number of shares of common stock (after deducting shares for minimum required statutory withholdings), if the employee remains employed by the Company on the vesting date, subject to certain accelerated vesting rights. Dividends will accrue as and when dividends are declared by the Company on shares of its common stock, but will not be paid unless and until the Units vest and are settled. The fair values of the performance-based Units were determined by utilizing a Monte Carlo model to simulate a range of possible future stock prices for the Company's common stock. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these performance-based awards were   0.75%   for risk-free interest rate and   28.14%   for expected stock price volatility. 
                
    56,979   service-based Units granted on January 30, 2015, representing the right to receive an equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock (after deducting shares for minimum required statutory withholdings) if and when the Units vest. The Units will cliff vest in   one   installment on December 31, 2017, if the employee remains employed by the Company on the vesting date, subject to certain accelerated vesting rights. Dividends will accrue as and when dividends are declared by the Company on shares of its common stock, but will not be paid unless and until the Units vest and are settled. 
                
    38,908   target amount of performance-based Units, granted on January 10, 2014, representing the right to receive an equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock (after deducting shares for minimum required statutory withholdings) if and when the Units vest based on the Company s TSR measured over a performance period ending on December 31, 2016, which is the date the awards cliff vest. The other terms of these performance-based Units are identical to the terms described above for the performance-based Units granted in 2015. The fair values of the performance-based Units were determined by utilizing a Monte Carlo model to simulate a range of possible future stock prices for the Company's common stock. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these performance-based awards were   0.76%   for risk-free interest rate and   44.84%   for expected stock price volatility. 
                
    57,412   service-based Units, granted on January 10, 2014, representing the right to receive an equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock (after deducting shares for minimum required statutory withholdings) if and when the Units vest. The Units will cliff vest in   one   installment on December 31, 2016, if the employee remains employed by the Company on the vesting date, subject to certain accelerated vesting rights. Dividends will accrue as and when dividends are declared by the Company on shares of its common stock, but will not be paid unless and until the Units vest and are settled.  
                
    4,751   service-based Units granted on various dates, representing the right to receive an equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock (after deducting shares for minimum required statutory withholdings) if and when the Units vest. The Units have an original vesting term of   three   years. Upon vesting of these Units, holders will receive shares of the Company's common stock in the amount of the vested Units, net of statutory minimum required tax withholdings. Dividends will accrue as and when dividends are declared by the Company on shares of its common stock, but will not be paid unless and until the Units vest and are settled. 
     Directors' Awards   During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company awarded to non-employee Directors   12,953   CSEs and   72,537   restricted shares of common stock at a fair value per share of   $9.65   at the time of grant. The CSEs and restricted shares have a vesting term of   7.5   months and   one   year, respectively. Dividends will accrue as and when dividends are declared by the Company on shares of its common stock, but will not be paid unless and until the CSEs and restricted shares of common stock vest and are settled. As of   September 30, 2016  , a combined total of   333,384   CSEs and restricted shares of common stock granted to members of the Company's Board of Directors remained outstanding under the Company's Non-Employee Directors Deferral Plan, with an aggregate intrinsic value of   $3.6 million  .

401(k) Plan   The Company made gross contributions of   $0.1 million   and   $0.9 million   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $0.1 million   and   $1.0 million   for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

Note 15 Earnings Per Share 
    
  Earnings per share ("EPS") is calculated using the two-class method, which allocates earnings among common stock and participating securities to calculate EPS when an entity's capital structure includes either two or more classes of common stock or common stock and participating securities. HPU holders were current and former Company employees who purchased high performance common stock units under the Company's High Performance Unit Program. These HPU units were treated as a separate class of common stock. All of the Company's outstanding HPUs were repurchased and retired on August 13, 2015. 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations used in the basic and diluted EPS calculations ($ in thousands, except for per share data):

Note 16 Fair Values 
  Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to be used in valuation techniques to measure fair value: 
  Level 1:    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 
  Level 2:    Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and 
  Level 3:    Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). 
  Certain of the Company's assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value either on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Assets required to be marked-to-market and reported at fair value every reporting period are classified as being valued on a recurring basis. Assets not required to be recorded at fair value every period may be recorded at fair value if a specific provision or other impairment is recorded within the period to mark the carrying value of the asset to market as of the reporting date. Such assets are classified as being valued on a non-recurring basis.

The following fair value hierarchy table summarizes the Company's assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis by the above categories ($ in thousands): 

____________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    The fair value of the Company's derivatives are based upon widely accepted valuation techniques utilized by a third-party specialist using observable inputs such as interest rates and contractual cash flow and are classified as Level 2. The fair value of the Company's available-for-sale securities are based upon unadjusted third-party broker quotes and are classified as Level 3. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company acquired   $4.4 million   of available for sale securities. There were no other material changes in Level 3 assets and there were no transfers into/out of Level 3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
              (2) 
    The Company recorded a provision for loan losses on   one   loan with a fair value of   $144.7 million   based on expected proceeds from liquidation. In addition, the Company recorded a recovery of loan losses on   one   loan with a fair value of   $30.2 million   based on market comparable sales and estimated closing costs of   4.0%  . 
              (3) 
    The Company recorded an impairment of   $3.8 million   equal to the carrying value on a land and development asset due to the Company's expectation that it will receive no future cash flows from the asset. 
              (4) 
    The Company recorded a provision for loan losses on   one   loan with a fair value of   $3.2 million   based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate of   14.3%  . 
       
  Fair values of financial instruments   The Company's estimated fair values of its loans receivable and other lending investments and outstanding debt was   $1.7 billion   and   $4.0 billion  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   and   $1.6 billion   and   $4.3 billion  , respectively, as of   December 31, 2015  . The Company determined that the significant inputs used to value its loans receivable and other lending investments and debt obligations fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of other financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accrued interest receivable and accounts payable, approximate the fair values of the instruments. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash values are considered Level 1 on the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of other financial instruments, including derivative assets and liabilities, are included in the fair value hierarchy table above.

Forward-looking statements are included with respect to, among other things, iStar Inc.'s (the "Company's") current business plan, business strategy, portfolio management, prospects and liquidity. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words "believe," "project," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "strategy," "plan," "may," "should," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In assessing all forward-looking statements, readers are urged to read carefully all cautionary statements contained in this Form 10-Q and the uncertainties and risks described in Item 1A "Risk Factors" in our   2015   Annual Report, all of which could affect our future results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For purposes of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the terms "we," "our" and "us" refer to iStar Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. 
  The discussion below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our 2015 Annual Report. These historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. We have reclassified certain items in our consolidated financial statements of prior periods to conform to our current financial statements presentation. 
   
  Introduction 
  iStar Inc., doing business as "iStar," finances, invests in and develops real estate and real estate related projects as part of its fully-integrated investment platform. We have invested more than $35 billion over the past two decades and are structured as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") with a diversified portfolio focused on larger assets located in major metropolitan markets. Our primary business segments are real estate finance, land and development, net lease and operating properties. 
   
  Executive Overview 
    
  We have continued to originate investments within our core business segments of real estate finance and net lease, which we anticipate should drive future revenue growth. In addition, we have made significant investments within our operating property and land and development portfolios in order to maximize asset value and better position assets for sale. Through strategic ventures, we have partnered with other providers of capital within our net lease segment and with developers with residential building expertise within our land and development segment. We expect these partnerships to have a positive impact on our business. 
  Access to the capital markets has allowed us to extend our debt maturity profile and remain primarily an unsecured borrower. In June 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility of   $450.0 million   and in August 2016 we upsized the facility to   $500.0 million  . Proceeds from this credit facility, together with cash on hand, were primarily used to repay in full the $323.2 million 2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources") and repay the $245.0 million balance outstanding on the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources"). In March 2016, we repaid our $261.4 million   5.875%   senior unsecured notes at maturity using available cash and we issued $275.0 million principal amount of   6.50%   senior unsecured notes due July 2021. Proceeds from the offering were primarily used to repay in full the $265.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes due July 2016 and repay $5.0 million of the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $547.5 million   of cash, which we expect to use primarily to repay debt and fund future investment activities.  
  During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , all four of our business segments, including real estate finance, net lease, operating properties and land and development, contributed positively to our earnings. We continue to work on repositioning or redeveloping our transitional operating properties and progressing on the entitlement and development of our land assets in order to maximize their value. We intend to continue these efforts, with the objective of having these assets contribute more positively to earnings in the future.  For the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net income allocable to common shareholders of   $46.3 million  , compared to a net loss of   $6.1 million   during the same period in the prior year.  Adjusted income allocable to common shareholders for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $49.1 million  , compared to   $27.3 million   during the same period in the prior year.

Adjusted Income 
    
  In addition to net income (loss) prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), we use adjusted income, a non-GAAP financial measure, to measure our operating performance. Adjusted income is used internally as a supplemental performance measure adjusting for certain non-cash GAAP measures to give management a view of income more directly derived from current period activity. Until the second quarter 2016, adjusted income was calculated as net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders, prior to the effect of depreciation and amortization, provision for (recovery of) loan losses, impairment of assets, stock-based compensation expense, and the non-cash portion of gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt. Effective in the second quarter 2016, we modified our presentation of adjusted income to reflect the effect of gains or losses on charge-offs and dispositions on book value gross of loan loss reserves and impairments ("Adjusted Income"). 
    
  Adjusted Income should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as shown in our consolidated statements of operations. Adjusted Income should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of our liquidity, nor is Adjusted Income indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs or available for distribution to shareholders. Rather, Adjusted Income is an additional measure we use to analyze our business performance. It should be noted that our manner of calculating Adjusted Income may differ from the calculations of similarly-titled measures by other companies.

           (1) 
    Depreciation and amortization also includes our proportionate share of depreciation and amortization expense for equity method investments and excludes the portion of depreciation and amortization expense allocable to noncontrolling interests. 
              (2) 
    For the   nine months   ended September 30, 2016, impairment of assets includes impairments on equity method investments recorded in "Earnings from equity method investments" in our consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, impairment of assets includes impairments on cost and equity method investments recorded in "Other income" and "Earnings from equity method investments," respectively, in our consolidated statements of operations.  
              (3) 
    Represents the impact of charge-offs and dispositions realized during the period. These charge-offs and dispositions were on assets   that were initially acquired prior to 2008   that were previously impaired for GAAP and reflected in net income but not Adjusted Income.

Real Estate Finance 
    
  Our real estate finance business targets sophisticated and innovative investors by providing one-stop capabilities that encompass financing alternatives ranging from full envelope senior loans to mezzanine and preferred equity capital positions. As of   September 30, 2016  , our real estate finance portfolio totaled   $1.65 billion  , gross of general loan loss reserves. The portfolio included   $1.37 billion   of performing loans with a weighted average maturity of   1.6   years.  
    
  The table below summarizes our loans and the reserves for loan losses associated with our loans ($ in thousands): 

Performing Loans   The table below summarizes our performing loans gross of reserves ($ in thousands): 

Non-Performing Loans   We designate loans as non-performing at such time as: (1) the loan becomes 90 days delinquent; (2) the loan has a maturity default; or (3) management determines it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. All non-performing loans are placed on non-accrual status and income is only recognized in certain cases upon actual cash receipt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company transferred a loan with a gross carrying value of   $157.2 million   to non-performing loans. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had non-performing loans with an aggregate carrying value of   $222.5 million   compared to non-performing loans with an aggregate carrying value of   $60.3 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . We expect that our level of non-performing loans will fluctuate from period to period. 
    
  Reserve for Loan Losses   The reserve for loan losses was   $95.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , or   5.7%   of total loans, compared to   $108.2 million   or   6.6%   as of   December 31, 2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the recovery of loan losses included recoveries of specific reserves of $11.7 million and a reduction in the general reserve of $14.8 million, partially offset by provisions on two non-performing loans of $13.8 million. We expect that our level of reserve for loan losses will fluctuate from period to period. Due to the volatility of the commercial real estate market, the process of estimating collateral values and reserves requires the use of significant judgment. We currently believe there is adequate collateral and reserves to support the carrying values of the loans.  
    
  The reserve for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and a formula-based component. An asset-specific reserve is established for an impaired loan when the estimated fair value of the loan's collateral less costs to sell is lower than the carrying

value of the loan. As of   September 30, 2016  , asset-specific reserves increased to   $74.2 million   compared to   $72.2 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , due primarily to a new non-performing loan partially offset by the recovery of reserves on two previously impaired non-performing loans.  
    
  The formula-based general reserve is derived from estimated principal default probabilities and loss severities applied to groups of performing loans based upon risk ratings assigned to loans with similar risk characteristics during our quarterly loan portfolio assessment. During this assessment, we perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments and future expectations about their credit quality based on all known and relevant factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. We estimate loss rates based on historical realized losses experienced within our portfolio and take into account current economic conditions affecting the commercial real estate market when establishing appropriate time frames to evaluate loss experience. 
    
  The general reserve decreased to   $21.2 million   or 1.5% of performing loans as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $36.0 million   or   2.4%   of performing loans as of   December 31, 2015  . The decrease was primarily attributable to a loan being classified to non-performing status to further evaluate for asset-specific reserves. 
    
  Net Lease 
    
  Our net lease business seeks to create stable cash flows through long-term leases to single tenants on our properties.  We target mission-critical facilities leased on a long-term basis to tenants, offering structured solutions that combine our capabilities in underwriting, lease structuring, asset management and build-to-suit construction. We invest in new net lease investments primarily through our net lease venture, in which we hold a 51.9% interest. The net lease venture has a right of first offer on any new net lease investments that we source.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our net lease portfolio, including equity method investments, totaled   $1.47 billion  , gross of   $362.3 million   of accumulated depreciation.  The table below provides certain statistics for our net lease portfolio.

  Commercial Operating Properties 
    
  Our commercial operating properties represent a diverse pool of assets across a broad range of geographies and collateral types including office, retail and hotel properties. We generally seek to reposition these assets with the objective of maximizing their values through the infusion of capital and/or intensive asset management efforts resulting in value realization upon sale.

Revenue   Operating lease income, which primarily includes income from net lease assets and commercial operating properties, decreased to   $51.4 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $55.7 million   for the same period in   2015  .  
    
  Operating lease income from net lease assets decreased to   $36.9 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $37.4 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to the sale of net lease assets in 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the execution of new leases. Operating lease income from same store net lease assets, defined as net lease assets we owned on or prior to July 1,   2015   and were in service through   September 30, 2016  , increased to   $35.3 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $33.9 million   for the same period in   2015  , an increase of 4.4%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in rent per occupied square foot to   $10.24   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $9.92   for the same period in   2015  , and an increase in the occupancy rate, which was   99.0%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   97.9%   as of   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Operating lease income from operating properties decreased to   $14.4 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $18.1 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to commercial operating property sales in 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the execution of new leases. Operating lease income from same store commercial operating properties, defined as commercial operating properties, excluding hotels and marinas, which we owned on or prior to July 1,   2015   and were in service through   September 30, 2016  , increased to   $11.6 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $10.2 million   for the same period in   2015  , due primarily to an increase in rent per occupied square foot, which increased to   $25.86   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $22.87   for the same period in   2015  . Occupancy rates were   70.8%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   71.8%   as of   September 30, 2015  . Ancillary operating lease income for land and development assets decreased slightly for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $0.1 million   from   $0.2 million   for the same period in 2015. 
    
  Interest income decreased to   $32.3 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $33.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the average balance of our performing loans, which decreased to   $1.42 billion   in 2016 from   $1.52 billion   in 2015. The weighted average yield on our performing loans increased to   9.1%   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   8.8%   for the same period in   2015  .

Other income decreased to   $13.4 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $16.9 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a financing commitment termination fee recognized in 2015 partially offset by revenue from operations at one of our hotel properties that commenced operations in the second quarter of 2016. 
  Land development revenue and cost of sales   During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of   $31.6 million   which had associated cost of sales of   $22.0 million  . We also recognized earnings from equity method investments of   $21.8 million   from unconsolidated land and development investments, resulting in total gross margin from our land and development portfolio of   $31.4 million  . During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of   $14.3 million   which had associated cost of sales of   $10.7 million  . We also recognized earnings from equity method investments of   $6.6 million   from unconsolidated land and development investments, resulting in total gross margin from our land and development portfolio of   $10.2 million  . The increase in 2016 from the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the progression of our land and development projects. 
  Costs and expenses   Interest expense decreased to   $55.1 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $56.9 million   for the same period in   2015   due to a decrease in the balance of our average outstanding debt, which decreased to   $3.96 billion   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $4.25 billion   for the same period in   2015  .

  Real estate expenses increased slightly to   $35.3 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $35.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase was due primarily to an increase in carry costs and other expenses on our land assets, which increased to   $9.4 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $7.2 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to an increase in costs incurred on certain land assets prior to development. Expenses for commercial operating properties decreased to   $18.9 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $19.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . This decrease was primarily due to commercial operating property sales during 2015 and 2016. Expenses from same store commercial operating properties, excluding hotels and marinas, increased to   $7.6 million   from   $7.1 million   for the same period in   2015  . Expenses associated with residential operating properties decreased to   $2.2 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $2.9 million   for the same period in   2015   due to the sale of residential units since   September 30, 2015  . Expenses for net lease assets decreased to   $4.8 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $5.5 million   for the same period in   2015   due primarily to the sale of net lease assets in 2015 and 2016. Expenses from same store net lease assets was   $4.2 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and   2015  .  
  Depreciation and amortization decreased to   $13.0 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $15.8 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to the sale of net lease and commercial operating properties in 2015 and 2016. 
  General and administrative expenses decreased to   $19.7 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $21.2 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense. 
  The net recovery of loan losses was   $15.0 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to a net provision for loan losses of   $7.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . Included in the net recovery for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   were recoveries of specific reserves of $11.7 million and a reduction in the general reserve of $15.8 million, partially offset by a provision on one non-performing loan of $12.5 million.  Included in the provision for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015   were provisions for specific reserves of   $1.6 million   and   $5.9 million   in the general reserve due primarily to new investment originations. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded an aggregate impairment of   $8.7 million   from the sale of net lease assets and a change in business strategy on one land asset. During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded impairments of   $3.9 million   resulting from a change in business strategy for a commercial operating property and unfavorable local market conditions for one residential property. 
  Other expense decreased to   $0.8 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $3.3 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The decrease was primarily the result of the change in the fair value of an interest rate cap that was not designated as a cash flow hedge and unsuccessful investment pursuit costs recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt, net   During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt resulting from repayments of unsecured notes prior to maturity. During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred losses on the early extinguishment of debt related to accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments on our credit facilities.

Earnings from equity method investments   Earnings from equity method investments increased to   $26.5 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $10.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized $15.8 million of earnings primarily from the distribution of non-recourse financing proceeds at one of our land equity method investments,   $6.2 million   related to sales activity on a land development venture,   $0.7 million   related to operations at our Net Lease Venture and   $3.8 million   was aggregate income from our remaining equity method investments. For the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized   $10.6 million   of earnings from equity method investments due primarily to   $10.0 million   related to sales activity on a land development venture. 
  Income tax benefit (expense)   Income taxes are primarily generated by assets held by our taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"). An income tax benefit of   $8.3 million   was recorded during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to income tax benefit of   $2.9 million   for the same period in   2015  . The income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily related to taxable losses generated by sales of certain TRS properties. In each period, different TRS properties were sold, each with a unique tax basis and sales value. The benefit, therefore, recognized in the current period differs from the benefit recognized during the same period in the prior year. 
    
  Income from sales of real estate   Income from sales of real estate increased to   $34.4 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $26.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold commercial operating properties resulting in gains of $23.4 million.

The decrease was primarily due to the sale of net lease assets in 2015 and 2016 partially offset by new leasing activity. Operating lease income from same store net lease assets, defined as net lease assets we owned on or prior to January 1,   2015   and were in service through   September 30, 2016  , increased to   $100.2 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $97.7 million   for the same period in   2015  . This increase was primarily due to an increase in rent per occupied square foot to   $9.68   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $9.54   for the same period in   2015  , and an increase in the occupancy rate, which was   99.0%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   97.9%   as of   September 30, 2015  .

The decrease was primarily due to commercial operating property sales in 2015 and 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in operating lease income from same store commercial operating properties, defined as commercial operating properties, excluding hotels and marinas, which we owned on or prior to January 1,   2015   and were in service through   September 30, 2016  . Operating lease income from same store commercial operating properties increased to   $34.2 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $31.7 million   for the same period in   2015  , due primarily to an increase in rent per occupied square foot, which increased to   $25.44   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $23.63   for the same period in   2015  .

  Interest income decreased to   $99.9 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $102.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in our average balance of performing loans to   $1.44 billion   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $1.52 billion   for the same period in   2015  . The weighted average yield on our performing loans decreased slightly to   8.9%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   9.0%   for the same period in   2015  .  
  Other income decreased to   $35.1 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $40.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a financing commitment termination fee, lease termination fees and a guarantor settlement on an operating property recognized in 2015, partially offset by an increase in hotel income in 2016. 
  Land development revenue and cost of sales   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of   $74.4 million   which had associated cost of sales of   $50.8 million  . We also recognized earnings from equity method investments of   $31.2 million   from unconsolidated land and development investments, resulting in total gross margin from our land and development portfolio of   $54.8 million  . During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of   $29.1 million   which had associated cost of sales of   $22.8 million  . We also recognized earnings from equity method investments of   $13.7 million   from unconsolidated land and development investments, resulting in total gross margin from our land and development portfolio of   $20.0 million  . The increase in 2016 from the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the progression of our land and development projects. 
  Costs and expenses   Interest expense increased to   $168.2 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $167.3 million   for the same period in   2015   due to an increase in our weighted average cost of debt. Our weighted average effective cost of debt was   5.6%   and   5.5%   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in interest expense from the increase in our weighted average cost of debt was partially offset by a decrease in our average balance of outstanding debt, which decreased to   $4.09 billion   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $4.15 billion   for the same period in   2015  .

The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in expenses for commercial operating properties which decreased to   $56.1 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $62.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . This decrease was primarily due to commercial operating property sales during 2015 and 2016.

Expenses from same store net lease assets decreased to   $12.1 million   from   $12.6 million   for the same period in   2015  .

  Depreciation and amortization decreased to   $42.2 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $49.8 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to the sale of net lease and commercial operating properties in 2015 and 2016. 
  The net recovery of loan losses was   $12.7 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to a net provision for loan losses of   $30.9 million   for the same period in   2015  . Included in the net recovery for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   were recoveries of specific reserves of $11.7 million and a reduction in the general reserve of $14.8 million, partially offset by provisions on two non-performing loans of $13.8 million. Included in the net provision for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   were provisions for specific reserves of   $31.4 million   due primarily to a new non-performing loan, partially offset by a decrease in the general reserve due to an overall improvement in the risk ratings of our loan portfolio. 
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded impairments     of   $11.8 million   comprised of $3.8 million on a land asset resulting from a change in business strategy,   $3.0 million   on a residential operating property resulting from unfavorable local market conditions and $4.9 million on the sale of net lease assets. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded impairments of   $5.6 million   resulting from a change in business strategy for two commercial operating properties and unfavorable local market conditions for one residential property. 
    
  Other expense decreased to   $4.7 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $6.3 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in the fair value of an interest rate cap that was not designated as a cash flow hedge and unsuccessful investment pursuit costs recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by third party expenses incurred in 2016 in connection with the refinancing of our 2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility with our 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources"). 
    
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt, net   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $1.6 million   of losses on early extinguishment of debt resulting from repayments of the 2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility and unsecured notes prior to maturity. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $0.3 million   of losses on the early extinguishment of debt primarily related to accelerated amortization of discounts and fees in connection with amortization payments on our credit facilities. 
  Earnings from equity method investments   Earnings from equity method investments increased to   $74.3 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $25.9 million   for the same period in   2015  . During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $33.2 million   primarily from the sale of an equity method investment in a commercial operating property,   $11.6 million   of earnings primarily from the distribution of non-recourse financing proceeds at one of our land equity method investments,   $19.6 million   related to sales activity on a land development venture,   $2.6 million   related to operations at our Net Lease Venture and   $7.3 million   was aggregate income from our remaining equity method investments. For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  ,   $19.6 million   related to sales activity on a land development venture,   $4.3 million   related to operations at our Net Lease Venture and   $2.0 million   was aggregate income from our remaining equity method investments. 
    
  Income tax benefit (expense)   Income taxes are primarily generated by assets held by our TRSs. An income tax benefit of   $9.9 million   was recorded during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to income tax expense of   $3.8 million   for the same period in   2015  . The income tax benefit for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   primarily related to taxable losses generated from sales of certain TRS properties. The income tax expense for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   primarily related to taxable income generated from the sales of certain TRS properties. In each period, different TRS properties were sold, each with a unique tax basis and sales value.  The benefit, therefore, recognized in the current period differs from the expense incurred during the same period in the previous year. 
    
  Income from sales of real estate   Income from sales of real estate increased to   $88.4 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $66.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold commercial operating properties resulting in gains of   $49.2 million  . During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we sold a commercial operating property for $68.5 million to a newly formed unconsolidated entity in which we own a 50% equity interest and recognized a gain on sale of $13.6 million, reflecting our share of the interest sold. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we sold residential condominiums that resulted in income of   $23.3 million   and   $36.8 million  , respectively. The decrease was due primarily to our decreasing inventory of residential condominiums. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, we sold net lease assets resulting in gains of   $15.9 million   and   $15.6 million  , respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
    
  During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we invested a total of   $165.5 million   associated with new investments, prior financing commitments as well as ongoing development during the quarter. Total investments included   $85.4 million   in lending and other investments,   $27.5 million   to develop our land and development assets and   $52.6 million   of capital to reposition or redevelop our operating properties and invest in net lease assets. Also during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated   $262.2 million   of proceeds from loan repayments and asset sales within our portfolio, comprised of   $49.1 million   from real estate finance,   $85.8 million   from operating properties,   $78.8 million   from net lease assets,   $42.5 million   from land and development assets and   $6.0 million   from other investments. These amounts are inclusive of fundings and proceeds from both consolidated investments and our pro rata share from equity method investments. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had unrestricted cash of   $547.5 million  .  
  The following table outlines our capital expenditures on real estate and land and development assets as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , by segment ($ in thousands): 

Our primary cash uses over the next 12 months are expected to be funding of investments, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and funding ongoing business operations. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repaid in full the   $323.2 million   2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility (as defined below), the   $265.0 million   principal amount of senior unsecured notes due July 2016 and the   $261.4 million   principal amount of senior unsecured notes due March 2016. We have other debt maturities of   $753.0 million   due before   September 30, 2017  . Over the next 12 months, we currently expect to fund in the range of approximately   $150 million   to   $225 million   of capital expenditures within our portfolio. The majority of these amounts relate to our land and development and operating properties business segments and include multifamily and residential development activities which are expected to include approximately   $100 million   in vertical construction. The amount spent will depend on the pace of our development activities as well as the extent to which we strategically partner with others to complete these projects. As of   September 30, 2016  , we also had approximately   $541 million   of maximum unfunded commitments associated with our investments of which we expect to fund the majority over the next two years, assuming borrowers and tenants meet all milestones and performance hurdles and all other conditions to fundings are met (see "Unfunded Commitments" below). Our capital sources to meet cash uses through the next 12 months and beyond will primarily be expected to include cash on hand, income from our portfolio, loan repayments from borrowers, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings available under our 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility and capital raised through debt and/or equity capital raising transactions.  
  We cannot predict with certainty the specific transactions we will undertake to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they come due. We will adjust our plans as appropriate in response to changes in our expectations and changes in market conditions. While economic trends have stabilized, it is not possible for us to predict whether these trends will continue or to quantify the impact of these or other trends on our financial results.

  2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility   In June 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility of   $450.0 million   (the "2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility"). In August 2016, we upsized the facility to $500.0 million. The initial $450.0 million of the 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility was issued at 99% of par and the upsize was issued at par. The 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility bears interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 4.50% with a 1.00% LIBOR floor. The 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility is collateralized 1.25x by a first lien on a fixed pool of assets. Proceeds from principal repayments and sales of collateral are applied to amortize the 2016 Secured Credit Facility. Proceeds received for interest, rent, lease payments and fee income are retained by us. We may also make optional prepayments, subject to prepayment fees, and are required to repay 0.25% of the principal amount outstanding on the first business day of each quarter beginning on October 3, 2016. Proceeds from the 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility, together with cash on hand, were primarily used to repay in full the   $323.2 million   2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility (as defined below) and repay the   $245.0 million   balance outstanding on the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). 
  2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility   In March 2015, we entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a maximum capacity of $250.0 million (the "2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility"). Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at a floating rate indexed to one of several base rates plus a margin which adjusts upward or downward based upon our corporate credit rating. An undrawn credit facility commitment fee ranges from 0.375% to 0.50%, based on average utilization each quarter. During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average cost of the credit facility was   3.22%  . Commitments under the revolving facility mature in March 2018. At maturity, we may convert outstanding borrowings to a one-year term loan which matures in quarterly installments through March 2019. As of September 30, 2016, we had $250.0 million of borrowing capacity available under the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility. 
  2012 Secured Credit Facilities   In March 2012, we entered into an   $880.0 million   senior secured credit agreement providing for   two   tranches of term loans: a   $410.0 million   2012 A-1 tranche due March 2016, which accrued interest at a rate of LIBOR + 4.00% (the "2012 Secured Tranche A-1 Facility"), and a   $470.0 million   2012 A-2 tranche due March 2017, which accrued interest at a rate of   LIBOR + 5.75%   (the "2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility," together the "2012 Secured Credit Facilities"). The 2012 A-1 and A-2 tranches were issued at   98.0%   of par and   98.5%   of par, respectively, and both tranches included a LIBOR floor of   1.25%  .  
  The 2012 Secured Tranche A-1 Facility was fully repaid in August 2013. In June 2016, proceeds from the 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility were used to repay in full the 2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , repayments of the 2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility prior to maturity resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of   $1.2 million   related to the accelerated amortization of discounts and unamortized deferred financing fees on the portion of the facility that was repaid. During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , repayments of the 2012 Secured Tranche A-2 Facility prior to maturity resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of   $0.1 million   and   $0.3

million  , respectively. These amounts are included in "Loss on early extinguishment of debt, net" in our consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Unsecured Notes   In March 2016, we repaid our   $261.4 million   principal amount of   5.875%   senior unsecured notes at maturity using available cash. In addition, we issued   $275.0 million   principal amount of   6.50%   senior unsecured notes due July 2021. Proceeds from the offering were primarily used to repay in full the   $265.0 million   principal amount of senior unsecured notes due July 2016 and repay   $5.0 million   of the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility. In September 2016, we repurchased and retired   $21.8 million   of our   1.50%   Convertible Notes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, repayments of unsecured notes prior to maturity resulted in losses on early extinguishment of debt of   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively. This amount is included in "Loss on early extinguishment of debt, net" in our consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Encumbered/Unencumbered Assets   As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of our encumbered and unencumbered assets by asset type are as follows ($ in thousands): 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
      
  Debt Covenants   Our outstanding unsecured debt securities contain corporate level covenants that include a covenant to maintain a ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness of at least   1.2  x and a covenant not to incur additional indebtedness (except for incurrences of permitted debt), if on a pro forma basis, our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, determined in accordance with the indentures governing our debt securities, is   1.5  x or lower. If any of our covenants are breached and not cured within applicable cure periods, the breach could result in acceleration of our debt securities unless a waiver or modification is agreed upon with the requisite percentage of the bondholders. While our ability to incur additional indebtedness under the fixed charge coverage ratio is currently limited, we are permitted to incur indebtedness for the purpose of refinancing existing indebtedness and for other permitted purposes under the indentures. 
  The 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility and the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility contain certain covenants, including covenants relating to collateral coverage, dividend payments, restrictions on fundamental changes, transactions with affiliates, matters relating to the liens granted to the lenders and the delivery of information to the lenders. In particular, the 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility requires us to maintain collateral coverage of at least   1.25  x outstanding borrowings on the facility. The 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a borrowing base of assets and requires us to maintain both collateral coverage of at least   1.5  x outstanding borrowings on the facility and a consolidated ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of at least   1.5  x. The 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility does not require that proceeds from the borrowing base be used to pay down outstanding borrowings provided the collateral coverage remains at least 1.5x outstanding borrowings on the facility. To satisfy this covenant, we have the option to pay down outstanding borrowings or substitute assets in the borrowing base. In addition, for so long as we maintain our qualification as a REIT, the 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility and the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility permit us to distribute   100%   of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis (prior to deducting certain cumulative NOL carryforwards). We may not pay common dividends if we cease to qualify as a REIT. 
    
  The 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facility and the 2015 Secured Revolving Credit Facility contain cross default provisions that would allow the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if we fail to pay amounts due in respect of our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds or if the lenders under such other indebtedness are otherwise permitted to accelerate such indebtedness for any reason. The indentures governing our unsecured public debt securities permit the bondholders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds is not paid at final maturity or if such indebtedness is accelerated.

     Table of Contents  

Derivatives   Our use of derivative financial instruments is primarily limited to the utilization of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps or other instruments to manage interest rate risk exposure and foreign exchange contracts to manage our risk to changes in foreign currencies.  Refer to   Note 12   to the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We are not dependent on the use of any off-balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity. We have made investments in various unconsolidated ventures. Refer to   Note 7   to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our unconsolidated investments. Our maximum exposure to loss from these investments is limited to the carrying value of our investments and any unfunded commitments (see below). 
    
  Unfunded Commitments   We generally fund construction and development loans and build-outs of space in real estate assets over a period of time if and when the borrowers and tenants meet established milestones and other performance criteria. We refer to these arrangements as Performance-Based Commitments. In addition, we sometimes establish a maximum amount of additional funding which we will make available to a borrower or tenant for an expansion or addition to a project if we approve of the expansion or addition in our sole discretion. We refer to these arrangements as Discretionary Fundings. Finally, we have committed to invest capital in several real estate funds and other ventures. These arrangements are referred to as Strategic Investments. As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum amounts of the fundings we may make under each category, assuming all performance hurdles and milestones are met under the Performance-Based Commitments, that we approve all Discretionary Fundings and that 100% of our capital committed to Strategic Investments is drawn down, are as follows (in thousands):

  Stock Repurchase Program   In February 2016, after having substantially utilized the remaining availability previously authorized, our Board of Directors authorized a new $50.0 million stock repurchase program. After having substantially utilized the availability authorized in February 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to the stock repurchase program to $50.0 million, effective August 4, 2016. The program authorizes the repurchase of common stock from time to time in open market and privately negotiated purchases, including pursuant to one or more trading plans. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   10.2 million   shares of our outstanding common stock for   $98.4 million  , at an average cost of   $9.67   per share.  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we repurchased   1.7 million   shares of our outstanding common stock for   $20.3 million  , at an average cost of   $12.16   per share. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to   $50.0 million   and   $48.7 million  , respectively, of common stock under our stock repurchase program.  
  HPU Repurchase   In August 2015, we repurchased and retired all of our 14,888 High Performance Units ("HPUs" outstanding, representing approximately 2.8 million common stock equivalents. We repurchased these HPUs at fair value from current and former employees through an arms-length tender offer. HPU holders could elect to receive $9.30 in cash or 0.7 shares of iStar common stock, or a combination thereof, per common stock equivalent underlying the HPUs. Approximately 37% of the outstanding HPUs were exchanged for $9.8 million in cash and approximately 63% of the outstanding HPUs were exchanged for 1.2 million shares of our common stock with a fair value of $15.2 million, representing the number of shares issued at the closing price of our common stock on August 13, 2015. The transaction value in excess of the HPUs carrying value of $9.8 million was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings in our consolidated statements of changes in equity. 
   
  Critical Accounting Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well controlled, reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. We base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and, therefore, routinely require adjustment. 
  In accordance with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   we present debt issuance costs as a deduction from the carrying value of "Debt obligations, net" and "Loan  
  participations payable, net" on our consolidated balance sheets, which is consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. These costs were previously recorded in "Deferred expenses and other assets, net" on our consolidated balance sheets. However, debt issuance costs associated with revolving-debt arrangements are recorded in "Deferred expenses and other assets, net" on our consolidated balance sheets.  
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,   which modified the analysis we must perform to determine whether we should consolidate certain types of entities. The guidance does not amend the existing disclosure requirements variable interest entities or voting interest entities ("VOEs"). The guidance, however, modified the requirements to qualify under the VOE model. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2014-16,   Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to Debt or to Equity   ("ASU 2014-16") which eliminated the diversity in practice for the accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share. ASU 2014-16 requires management to consider all terms and features, whether stated or implied, of a hybrid instrument when determining whether the nature of the instrument is more akin to a debt instrument or an equity instrument. Embedded derivative features, which are accounted for separately from host contracts, should also be considered in the analysis of the hybrid instrument. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remainder of our significant accounting policies, which are detailed in our 2015 Annual Report, have not changed materially. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements   For a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our financial condition or results of operations, refer to   Note 3   to the consolidated financial statements.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Market Risks 
  Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Our operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets will affect the spread between our floating rate assets and liabilities subject to the net amount of floating rate assets/liabilities and the impact of interest rate floors and caps. Any significant compression of the spreads between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us. 
  In the event of a significant rising interest rate environment or economic downturn, defaults could increase and cause us to incur additional credit losses which would adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. Such delinquencies or defaults would likely have a material adverse effect on the spreads between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, an increase in interest rates could, among other things, reduce the value of our fixed-rate interest-bearing assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets. 
  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. We monitor the spreads between our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and may implement hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations, including engaging in interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and other interest rate-related derivative contracts. Such strategies are designed to reduce our exposure, on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis, to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes or as a hedge against changes in our credit risk or the credit risk of our borrowers. 
  While a REIT may utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets without generating non-qualifying income, use of derivatives for other purposes will generate non-qualified income for REIT income test purposes. This includes hedging asset related risks such as credit, foreign exchange and interest rate exposure on our loan assets. As a result our ability to hedge these types of risks is limited. There can be no assurance that our profitability will not be materially adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates. 
  The following table quantifies the potential changes in annual net income, assuming no change in our interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, should interest rates increase by 10, 50 or 100 basis points or decrease by 10 basis points, assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve (i.e., relative interest rates). The base interest rate scenario assumes the one-month LIBOR rate of   0.53%   as of   September 30, 2016  . Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table.

______________________________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    We have an overall net variable-rate asset position, which results in an increase in net income when rates increase and a decrease in net income when rates decrease. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $748.6 million   of our floating rate loans have a cumulative weighted average interest rate floor of   0.2%   and   $639.5 million   of our floating rate debt has a cumulative weighted average interest rate floor of   0.9%  .  

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company has formed a disclosure committee that is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining the disclosure obligations of the Company on a timely basis. The disclosure committee reports directly to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the disclosure committee and other members of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
  There have been no changes during the last fiscal quarter in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company's periodic reports.

  Item 1.    Legal Proceedings 
  The Company and/or one or more of its subsidiaries is party to various pending litigation matters that are considered ordinary routine litigation incidental to its real estate and real estate related business activities, including loan foreclosure and foreclosure-related proceedings. In addition to such matters, the Company is a party to the following legal proceedings: 
  Shareholder Action 
  On March 7, 2014, a shareholder action purporting to assert derivative, class and individual claims was filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland naming the Company, a number of our current and former senior executives (including our chief executive officer) and current and former directors as defendants.  The complaint sought unspecified damages and other relief and alleged breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and other causes of action arising out of shares of our common stock issued by the Company to our senior executives pursuant to restricted stock unit awards granted in December 2008 and modified in July 2011. The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the plaintiffs  claims, which the Circuit Court granted on October 30, 2014 and, as a result, all of plaintiffs' claims in this action were dismissed. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of their claims and on January 28, 2016, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the order of the Circuit Court. Plaintiffs then filed a petition for certiorari with the Maryland Court of Appeals, requesting that the decision of the Court of Special Appeals be reversed. On May 20, 2016, the Maryland Court of Appeals granted the petition for writ of certiorari and agreed to hear the appeal. Oral argument was held on October 7, 2016 and the Company is awaiting a decision from the Court of Appeals. 
  U.S. Home Corporation ("Lennar") v. Settlers Crossing, LLC, et al. (Civil Action No. DKC 08-1863) 
  On January 22, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland (the "Court") entered a judgment in favor of the Company in the matter of U.S. Home Corporation ("Lennar") v. Settlers Crossing, LLC, et al. (Civil Action No. DKC 08-1863). The litigation involved a dispute over the purchase and sale of approximately 1,250 acres of land in Prince George s County, Maryland. The Court found that the Company is entitled to specific performance and awarded damages to it in the aggregate amount of: (i) the remaining purchase price to be paid by Lennar of $114.0 million; plus (ii) interest on the unpaid amount at a rate of 12% per annum, calculated on a per diem basis, from May 27, 2008, until Lennar proceeds to settlement on the land; plus (iii) real estate taxes paid by the Company; plus (iv) actual and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred by the Company in connection with the litigation. The Court ordered Lennar to proceed to settlement on the land and to pay the total amounts awarded to the Company within 30 days of the judgment. Lennar appealed the Court's judgment and has posted an appeal bond. The Court has granted Lennar's motion to stay the judgment pending appeal. The Court also clarified the judgment that the unpaid amount will accrue simple interest at a rate of 12% annually, including while the appeal is pending. In the pending appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the parties have filed their respective briefs. Oral argument in the appeal, originally scheduled for October 26, 2016, has been continued by order of the Court of Appeals and will be rescheduled for the next available oral argument session. There can be no assurance as to the timing or actual receipt by the Company of amounts awarded by the Court or the outcome of the appeal. A third party purchased a participation interest in the Company's original loan and presently holds a 7.8% participation interest in all proceeds.
