1.      Basis of Presentation  

The primary business of Flushing Financial Corporation (the  Holding
Company ), a Delaware corporation, is the operation of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Flushing Bank (the  Bank ). 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements presented in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Quarterly Report ) include the collective results of the Holding Company and its direct
and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the Bank, Flushing Preferred Funding Corporation, Flushing Service Corporation,
and FSB Properties Inc., which are collectively herein referred to as  we,   us,   our  and
the  Company.  

The Holding Company also owns Flushing Financial Capital Trust II,
Flushing Financial Capital Trust III, and Flushing Financial Capital Trust IV (the  Trusts ), which are special purpose
business trusts. The Trusts are not included in the Company s consolidated financial statements as the Company would not
absorb the losses of the Trusts if any losses were to occur. 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and general
practices within the banking industry. The information furnished in these interim statements reflects all adjustments which are,
in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for such presented periods of the Company. Such adjustments
are of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report. All inter-company balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations in the interim statements are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the full year. 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with the instructions to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Article 10, Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X
for interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ). The unaudited consolidated interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

2.      Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to change in the near term are used in connection with the determination
of the allowance for loan losses ( ALL ), the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, the review of the need for a valuation
allowance of the Company s deferred tax assets, the fair value of financial instruments including the evaluation of other-than-temporary
impairment ( OTTI ) on securities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

3.      Earnings Per Share  

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income
available to common shareholders by the total weighted average number of common shares outstanding, which includes unvested participating
securities. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether
paid or unpaid) are participating securities and as such are included in the calculation of earnings per share. The Company s
unvested restricted stock unit awards are considered participating securities. Therefore, weighted average common shares outstanding
used for computing basic earnings per common share includes common shares outstanding plus unvested restricted stock unit awards.
The computation of diluted earnings per share includes the additional dilutive effect of stock options outstanding and other common
stock equivalents during the period. Common stock equivalents that are anti-dilutive are not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per common share. The numerator for calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share is net income available to
common shareholders. The shares held in the Company s Employee Benefit Trust are not included in shares outstanding for purposes
of calculating earnings per common share.

Earnings per common share have been computed based on the following: 

4.    Debt and Equity Securities    

The Company s investments in equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values and all investments in debt securities are classified in one of the following three categories and accounted
for accordingly: (1) trading securities, (2) securities available for sale and (3) securities held-to-maturity. 

The Company did not hold any trading securities at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015. Securities available for sale are recorded at fair value. Securities held-to-maturity are recorded
at amortized cost. 

The following table summarizes the Company s portfolio of
securities held-to-maturity at September 30, 2016:

Mortgage-backed securities shown in the table above include one
private issue collateralized mortgage obligation ( CMO ) that is collateralized by commercial real estate mortgages
with an amortized cost and market value of $0.4 million at September 30, 2016. 

The following table summarizes the Company s portfolio of
securities available for sale at December 31, 2015: 

Mortgage-backed securities shown in the table above include one
private issue CMO that is collateralized by commercial real estate mortgages with an amortized cost and market value of $7.7 million
at December 31, 2015.

The following table details the amortized cost and fair value of
the Company s securities classified as held-to-maturity at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity. Expected maturities
may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call
or prepayment penalties. 

The amortized cost and fair value of the Company s securities,
classified as available for sale at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may differ
from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment
penalties. 

The following table shows the Company s available for sale
securities with gross unrealized losses and their fair value, aggregated by category and length of time that individual securities
have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at September 30, 2016:

The following table shows the Company s available for sale securities with gross
unrealized losses and their fair value, aggregated by category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous
unrealized loss position, at December 31, 2015: 

OTTI losses on impaired securities must be fully recognized in earnings
if an investor has the intent to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the investor will be required to
sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost. However, even if an investor does not expect to sell a debt security,
the investor must evaluate the expected cash flows to be received and determine if a credit loss has occurred. In the event that
a credit loss has occurred, only the amount of impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized in earnings in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Amounts relating to factors other than credit losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
( AOCI ) within Stockholders  Equity. 

The Company reviewed each investment that had an unrealized loss
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an investment is less than
its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on available for sale securities, that are deemed to be temporary, are recorded in
AOCI, net of tax. 

The unrealized losses in total securities available for sale at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were caused by movements in interest rates. It is not anticipated that these securities
would be settled at a price that is less than the amortized cost of the Company s investment. Each of these securities is
performing according to its terms and, in the opinion of management, will continue to perform according to its terms. The Company
does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is more likely than not the Company will not be required to sell the securities
before recovery of the securities  amortized cost basis. This conclusion is based upon considering the Company s cash
and working capital requirements and contractual and regulatory obligations, none of which the Company believes would cause the
sale of the securities. Therefore, the Company did not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Company sold available for sale securities with book values
at the time of sale totaling $64.6 million and $163.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company did not sell any available for sale securities during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company sold available
for sale securities with book values at the time of sale totaling $138.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015.

The following table represents the gross gains and gross losses
realized from the sale of securities available for sale for the periods indicated: 

Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balance net of
any unearned income, charge-offs, deferred loan fees and costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased
loans. Interest on loans is recognized on the accrual basis. The accrual of income on loans is generally discontinued when certain
factors, such as contractual delinquency of 90 days or more, indicate reasonable doubt as to the timely collectability of such
income. Uncollected interest previously recognized on non-accrual loans is reversed from interest income at the time the loan is
placed on non-accrual status. A non-accrual loan can be returned to accrual status when contractual delinquency returns to less
than 90 days delinquent. Payments received on non-accrual loans that do not bring the loan to less than 90 days delinquent are
recorded on a cash basis. Payments can also be applied first as a reduction of principal until all principal is recovered and then
subsequently to interest, if in management s opinion, it is evident that recovery of all principal due is likely to occur.
Loan fees and certain loan origination costs are deferred. Net loan origination costs and premiums or discounts on loans purchased
are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loans using the level-yield method. Prepayment penalties received
on loans which pay in full prior to their scheduled maturity are included in interest income in the period they are collected. 

The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses at an amount,
which, in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management s
judgment in determining the adequacy of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans. This evaluation is
inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available.
An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses.  The
unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies
for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. The allowance is established through charges to earnings in the form
of a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the various components of the loan
portfolio and other factors, including historical loan loss experience (which is updated quarterly), current economic conditions,
delinquency and non-accrual trends, classified loan levels, risk in the portfolio and volumes and trends in loan types, recent
trends in charge-offs, changes in underwriting standards, experience, ability and depth of the Company s lenders, collection
policies and experience, internal loan review function and other external factors. Increases and decreases in the allowance other
than charge-offs and recoveries are included in the provision for loan losses. When a loan or a portion of a loan is determined
to be uncollectible, the portion deemed uncollectible is charged against the allowance, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are
credited to the allowance. 

The determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses
includes estimates that are susceptible to significant changes due to changes in appraisal values of collateral, national and local
economic conditions and other factors. We review our loan portfolio by separate categories with similar risk and collateral characteristics.
Impaired loans are segregated and reviewed separately. 

The Company segregated its loans into two portfolios based on year
of origination. One portfolio was reviewed for loans originated after December 31, 2009 and a second portfolio for loans originated
prior to January 1, 2010. Our decision to segregate the portfolio based upon origination dates was based on changes made in our
underwriting standards during 2009. By the end of 2009, all loans were being underwritten based on revised and tightened underwriting
standards. Loans originated prior to 2010 have a higher delinquency rate and loss history. Each of the years in the portfolio for
loans originated prior to 2010 has a similar delinquency rate. The Company s Board of Directors reviews and approves management s
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis.

The Company recognizes a loan as non-performing when the borrower
has demonstrated the inability to bring the loan current, or due to other circumstances which, in management s opinion, indicate
the borrower will be unable to bring the loan current within a reasonable time. All loans classified as non-performing, which includes
all loans past due 90 days or more, are classified as non-accrual unless there is, in our opinion, compelling evidence the borrower
will bring the loan current in the immediate future. Prior to a loan becoming 90 days delinquent an updated appraisal is ordered
and/or an internal evaluation is prepared. The loan balances of collateral dependent impaired loans are compared to the property s
updated fair value. The Company considers fair value of collateral dependent loans to be 85% of the appraised or internally estimated
value of the property. The balance which exceeds fair value is generally charged-off, except for taxi medallion loans. The fair
value of the underlying collateral of taxi medallion loans is the value of the underlying medallion based upon the most recently
reported arm s length transaction. When there is no recent sale activity, the fair value is calculated using capitalization
rates. In addition, taxi medallion loans with a loan-to-value greater than 100% are classified as impaired and allocated a portion
of the ALL in the amount of the excess of the loan-to-value over the loan s principal balance. The 85% is based on the actual
net proceeds the Bank has received from the sale of other real estate owned ( OREO ) as a percentage of OREO s
appraised value. 

A loan is considered impaired when, based upon current information,
the Company believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due, both principal and interest, in accordance
with the original terms of the loan. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan s effective interest rate or at the loan s observable market price or, as a practical expedient, the fair
value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. All non-accrual loans are considered impaired. Interest income on
impaired loans is recorded on the cash basis. 

The Company reviews each impaired loan on an individual basis to
determine if either a charge-off or a valuation allowance needs to be allocated to the loan. The Company does not charge-off or
allocate a valuation allowance to loans for which management has concluded the current value of the underlying collateral will
allow for recovery of the loan balance either through the sale of the loan or by foreclosure and sale of the property. 

The Company evaluates the underlying collateral through a third
party appraisal, or when a third party appraisal is not available, the Company will use an internal evaluation. The internal evaluations
are prepared using an income approach or a sales approach. The income approach is used for income producing properties and uses
current revenues less operating expenses to determine the net cash flow of the property. Once the net cash flow is determined,
the value of the property is calculated using an appropriate capitalization rate for the property. The sales approach uses comparable
sales prices in the market. When an internal evaluation is used, we place greater reliance on the income approach to value the
collateral. 

In preparing internal evaluations of property values, the Company
seeks to obtain current data on the subject property from various sources, including: (1) the borrower; (2) copies of existing
leases; (3) local real estate brokers and appraisers; (4) public records (such as for real estate taxes and water and sewer charges);
(5) comparable sales and rental data in the market; (6) an inspection of the property and (7) interviews with tenants. These internal
evaluations primarily focus on the income approach and comparable sales data to value the property. 

As of September 30, 2016, we utilized recent third party appraisals
of the collateral to measure impairment for $45.3 million, or 88.2%, of collateral dependent impaired loans, and used internal
evaluations of the property s value for $6.1 million, or 11.8%, of collateral dependent impaired loans. 

The Company may restructure a loan to enable a borrower experiencing
financial difficulties to continue making payments when it is deemed to be in the Company s best long-term interest. This
restructure may include reducing the interest rate or amount of the monthly payment for a specified period of time, after which
the interest rate and repayment terms revert to the original terms of the loan. We classify these loans as Troubled Debt Restructured
( TDR ). 

These restructurings have not included a reduction of principal
balance. The Company believes that restructuring these loans in this manner will allow certain borrowers to become and remain current
on their loans. All loans classified as TDR are considered impaired, however TDR loans which have been current for six consecutive
months at the time they are restructured as TDR remain on accrual status and are not included as part of non-performing loans.
Loans which were delinquent at the time they are restructured as a TDR are placed on non-accrual status and reported as non-performing
loans until they have made timely payments for six consecutive months.

The allocation of a portion of the allowance for loan losses for
a performing TDR loan is based upon the present value of the future expected cash flows discounted at the loan s original
effective rate, or for a non-performing TDR which is collateral dependent, the fair value of the collateral. At September 30, 2016,
there were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans were modified to a TDR. The modification of loans to
a TDR did not have a significant effect on our operating results, nor did it require a significant allocation of the allowance
for loan losses.

In accordance with our policy and the current
regulatory guidelines, we designate loans as  Special Mention,  which are considered  Criticized Loans, 
and  Substandard,   Doubtful,  or  Loss,  which are considered  Classified Loans .
If a loan does not fall within one of the previous mentioned categories then the loan would be considered  Pass.  Loans
that are non-accrual are designated as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss. These loan designations are updated quarterly. We designate
a loan as Substandard when a well-defined weakness is identified that jeopardizes the orderly liquidation of the debt. We designate
a loan Doubtful when it displays the inherent weakness of a Substandard loan with the added provision that collection of the debt
in full, on the basis of existing facts, is highly improbable. We designate a loan as Loss if it is deemed the debtor is incapable
of repayment. The Company does not hold any loans designated as Loss, as loans that are designated as Loss are charged to the Allowance
for Loan Losses. We designate a loan as Special Mention if the asset does not warrant classification within one of the other classifications,
but does contain a potential weakness that deserves closer attention. 

The following table sets forth the recorded investment
in loans designated as Criticized or Classified at the periods indicated: 

Commitments to extend credit (principally real estate mortgage loans)
and lines of credit (principally home equity lines of credit and business lines of credit) amounted to $87.2 million and $231.8

6.      Loans held for sale  

Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated
fair value. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank did not have any loans held for sale. 

The Company has implemented a strategy of selling certain delinquent
and non-performing loans. Once the Company has decided to sell a loan, the sale usually closes in a short period of time, generally
within the same quarter. Loans designated held for sale are reclassified from loans held for investment to loans held for sale.
Terms of sale include cash due upon the closing of the sale, no contingencies or recourse to the Company and servicing is released
to the buyer.

8.      Repurchase Agreements  

As part of the Company s strategy to finance investment opportunities
and manage its cost of funds, the Company enters into repurchase agreements with broker-dealers and the Federal Home Loan Bank
of New York ( FHLB-NY ). These agreements are recorded as financing transactions and the obligations to repurchase
are reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements. The securities underlying the agreements are delivered to
the broker-dealers or the FHLB-NY who arrange the transaction. The securities remain registered in the name of the Company and
are returned upon the maturity of the agreement. The Company retains the right of substitution of collateral throughout the terms
of the agreements. As a condition of the repurchase agreements the Company is required to provide sufficient collateral. If the
fair value of the collateral were to fall below the required level, the Company is obligated to pledge additional collateral. All
the repurchase agreements are collateralized by mortgage-backed securities. 

The following tables show the type of securities pledged and remaining
maturity of repurchase agreements held at the periods indicated: 

The fair value of the collateral pledged for the
repurchase agreements above was $44.1 million and $131.4 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
$38.0 million in repurchase agreements, at an average cost of 4.16%, which were scheduled to mature in late 2017, were pre-paid.
A $2.1 million prepayment penalty was incurred as part of this transaction. 

9.      Stock-Based Compensation  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s
net income, as reported, includes $1.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation costs and $0.4 million
and $0.2 million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to the stock-based compensation plans in each of the periods. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s net income, as reported, includes $4.7 million and $4.2
million of stock-based compensation costs and $1.8 million and $1.6 million of income tax benefits related to the stock-based compensation
plans. The Company did not issue any restricted stock units during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company granted 337,175 and 318,120 restricted stock units, respectively. The
Company has not granted any stock options since 2009.

The Company estimated the fair value of stock options using the
Black-Scholes valuation model. Key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options included the exercise price of
the award, the expected option term, the expected volatility of the Company s stock price, the risk-free interest rate over
the options  expected term and the annual dividend yield. The Company uses the fair value of the common stock on the date
of award to measure compensation cost for restricted stock unit awards. Compensation cost is recognized over the vesting period
of the award using the straight line method. 

The following table summarizes the Company s restricted stock
unit ( RSU ) awards under the 2014 Omnibus Plan and the Prior Plans in the aggregate at or for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016: 

As of September 30, 2016, there was $7.4 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested full value awards granted under the 2014 Omnibus Plan and the Prior Plans. That cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.3 years. The total fair value of awards vested for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $4,000 and $39,000, respectively. The total fair value of awards vested for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $4.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The vested but unissued RSU awards consist of
awards made to employees and directors who are eligible for retirement. According to the terms of these awards, which provide for
vesting upon retirement, these employees and directors have no risk of forfeiture. These shares will be issued at the original
contractual vesting and settlement dates. 

The following table summarizes certain information regarding the
stock option awards under the 2014 Omnibus Plan and the Prior Plans in the aggregate at or for the nine months ended September
30, 2016:

Phantom Stock Plan: The Company maintains a non-qualified phantom stock plan as a supplement to its profit
sharing plan for officers who have achieved the designated level and completed one year of service. The Company adjusts its liability
under this plan to the fair value of the shares at the end of each period. 

The following table summarizes the Phantom Stock Plan at or for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense for the Phantom
Stock Plan of $0.4 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There were no
distributions for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

11.        Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

The Company carries certain financial assets and financial liabilities
at fair value in accordance with GAAP which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. GAAP permits entities to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value. At September 30, 2016, the Company carried financial assets and financial liabilities
under the fair value option with fair values of $30.7 million and $27.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015, the Company
carried financial assets and financial liabilities under the fair value option with fair values of $30.7 million and $29.0 million,
respectively. The Company did not elect to carry any additional financial assets or financial liabilities under the fair value
option during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

The following table presents the financial assets and financial
liabilities reported at fair value under the fair value option, and the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statement
of Income   Net gain (loss) from fair value adjustments, at or for the periods ended as indicated: 

(1)    The
                                         net gain (loss) from fair value adjustments presented in the above table does not include
                                         net losses of $0.5 million and $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30,
                                         2016 and 2015, respectively, from the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps.    

(2)    The
                                         net gain (loss) from fair value adjustments presented in the above table does not include
                                         net losses of $4.3 million and $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
                                         and 2015, respectively, from the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps.    

Included in the fair value of the financial assets and financial
liabilities selected for the fair value option is the accrued interest receivable or payable for the related instrument. The Company
reports as interest income or interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income, the interest receivable or payable on the
financial instruments selected for the fair value option at their respective contractual rates. 

The borrowed funds had a contractual principal amount of $61.9 million
at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The fair value of borrowed funds includes accrued interest payable of $0.1 million
at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Company generally holds its earning assets, other than securities
available for sale, to maturity and settles its liabilities at maturity. However, fair value estimates are made at a specific point
in time and are based on relevant market information. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result
from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular instrument. Accordingly, as assumptions
change, such as interest rates and prepayments, fair value estimates change and these amounts may not necessarily be realized in
an immediate sale. 

Disclosure of fair value does not require fair value information
for items that do not meet the definition of a financial instrument or certain other financial instruments specifically excluded
from its requirements. These items include core deposit intangibles and other customer relationships, premises and equipment, leases,
income taxes and equity. 

Further, fair value disclosure does not attempt to value future
income or business. These items may be material and accordingly, the fair value information presented does not purport to represent,
nor should it be construed to represent, the underlying  market  or franchise value of the Company. 

Financial assets and financial liabilities reported at fair value
are required to be measured based on either: (1) quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments (Level 1);
(2) significant other observable inputs (Level 2); or (3) significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

A description of the methods and significant assumptions utilized
in estimating the fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis
are as follows: 

Level 1   where quoted market prices are available in an active
market. The Company did not value any of its assets or liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis as Level
1 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

  FLUSHING FINANCIAL CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES  

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  

 (Unaudited) 

Level 2   when quoted market prices are not available, fair
value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar financial instruments and adjusted for differences between the quoted
instrument and the instrument being valued. Fair value can also be estimated by using pricing models, or discounted cash flows.
Pricing models primarily use market-based or independently sourced market parameters as inputs, including, but not limited to,
yield curves, interest rates, equity or debt prices and credit spreads. In addition to observable market information, models also
incorporate maturity and cash flow assumptions. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Level 2 included mortgage related
securities, corporate debt, municipals and interest rate swaps. 

Level 3   when there is limited activity or less transparency
around inputs to the valuation, financial instruments are classified as Level 3. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Level
3 included trust preferred securities owned and junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company and a single issuer trust
preferred security. 

The methods described above may produce fair values that may not
be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While the Company believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the use of different methodologies, assumptions and models
to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could produce different estimates of fair value at the reporting date. 

The following table sets forth the assets and liabilities that are
carried at fair value on a recurring basis and the method that was used to determine their fair value, at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015:

The following tables present the quantitative information about
recurring Level 3 fair value of financial instruments and the fair value measurements at the periods indicated: 

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s trust preferred
securities and junior subordinated debentures valued under Level 3 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are the effective
yields used in the cash flow models. Significant increases or decreases in the effective yield in isolation would result in a significantly
lower or higher fair value measurement. 

The following table sets forth the Company s assets and liabilities
that are carried at fair value on a non-recurring basis and the method that was used to determine their fair value at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

The Company did not have any liabilities that were carried at fair
value on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The fair value of each material class of financial instruments at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the related methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value are as follows: 

Cash and Due from Banks, Overnight Interest-Earning Deposits
and Federal Funds Sold:  

The fair values of financial instruments that are short-term or reprice frequently and
have little or no risk are considered to have a fair value that approximates carrying value. 

FHLB-NY stock:  

The fair value is based upon the par value of the stock which equals its carrying value. 

Securities:  

The fair values of securities are contained in Note 4 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If a quoted market price is
not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities and adjusted for differences between the
quoted instrument and the instrument being valued. When there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation,
securities are valued using discounted cash flows. 

Loans:  

The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the expected
future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and remaining
maturities. 

For non-accruing loans, fair value is generally estimated by discounting
management s estimate of future cash flows with a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with such assets or
for collateral dependent loans 85% of the appraised or internally estimated value of the property, except for taxi medallion loans.
The fair value of the underlying collateral of taxi medallion loans is the most recent reported arm s length transaction.
When there is no recent sale activity, the fair value is calculated using capitalization rates.

Other Real Estate Owned:  

OREO are carried at fair value less selling costs. The fair value
is based on appraised value through a current appraisal, or sometimes through an internal review, additionally adjusted by the
estimated costs to sell the property. 

Accrued Interest Receivable:  

The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to its short-term nature. 

Due to Depositors:  

The fair values of demand, passbook savings, NOW, money market deposits
and escrow deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting dates (i.e. their carrying value).
The fair value of certificates of deposits are estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using the rates currently
offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 

Borrowings:  

The fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting the contractual
cash flows using interest rates in effect for borrowings with similar maturities and collateral requirements or using a market-standard
model. 

Accrued Interest Payable:  

The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to its short-term nature. 

Interest Rate Swaps:  

The fair value of interest rate swaps is based upon broker quotes. 

Other Financial Instruments:  

The fair values of commitments to sell, lend or borrow are estimated
using the fees currently charged or paid to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements
and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle with the
counterparties at the reporting date. For fixed-rate loan commitments to sell, lend or borrow, fair values also consider the difference
between current levels of interest rates and committed rates (where applicable). At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
fair values of the above financial instruments approximate the recorded amounts of the related fees and were not considered to
be material.

12.        Derivative Financial
Instruments  

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s
derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate swaps. The Company s interest rate swaps are used for two purposes.
The first purpose is to mitigate the Company s exposure to rising interest rates on a portion ($18.0 million) of its floating
rate junior subordinated debentures that have a contractual value of $61.9 million at both September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. The second purpose is to mitigate the Company s exposure to rising interest rates on certain fixed rate loans totaling
$208.1 million and $146.9 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, derivatives with a
combined notional amount of $36.3 million were not designated as hedges. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, derivatives
with a combined notional amount of $189.8 million and $128.5 million were designated as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair
value of interest rate swaps not designated as hedges are reflected in  Net gain (loss) from fair value adjustments 
in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

The following table sets forth information regarding the Company s
derivative financial instruments at the periods indicated: 

(1)  
      Derivatives in a net positive position are recorded as  Other assets  and derivatives
    in a net negative position are recorded as  Other liabilities  in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
    There were no unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company did not record any hedge ineffectiveness. 

The Company s interest rate swaps are subject to master netting
arrangements and are all with the same counterparty. The Company has not made a policy election to offset its derivative positions. 

The Company did not have derivative assets presented in the Consolidated
Statements of Condition at September 30, 2016.

Flushing Financial Corporation files consolidated Federal and combined
New York State and New York City income tax returns with its subsidiaries, with the exception of the Company s trusts, which
file separate Federal income tax returns as trusts, and Flushing Preferred Funding Corporation, which files a separate Federal
income tax return as a real estate investment trust. Additionally, the Bank files New Jersey State tax returns. 

Income tax provisions are summarized as follows: 

PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

  FLUSHING FINANCIAL CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES  

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  

 (Unaudited) 

The effective tax rate was 38.5% and 37.7% for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 39.5% and 38.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The increase in the effective tax rate reflects the reduced impact of preferential tax items, as a result of the gain on sale of
one of our properties in Flushing, Queens recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The effective rates differ from the statutory federal income tax
rate as follows: 

The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $34.8 million at
September 30, 2016, which is included in  Other assets  in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. This
represents the net federal, state and local tax benefits expected to be realized in future years upon the utilization of the underlying
tax attributes comprising this balance. The Company has reported taxable income for federal, state, and local tax purposes in each
of the past three fiscal years. In management s opinion, in view of the Company s previous, current and projected future
earnings trend, the probability that some of the Company s $23.3 million deferred tax liability can be used to offset a portion
of the deferred tax asset, as well as certain tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will
be fully realized. Accordingly, no valuation allowance was deemed necessary for the deferred tax asset at September 30, 2016.

15.            Regulatory
Capital   

Under current capital regulations, the Bank is required to comply
with four separate capital adequacy standards. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank continues to be categorized as  well-capitalized 
under the prompt corrective action regulations and continues to exceed all regulatory capital requirements. In 2016, a Capital
Conservation Buffer ( CCB ) requirement became effective for banks. The CCB is designed to establish a capital range
above minimum capital requirements and impose constraints on dividends, share buybacks and discretionary bonus payments when capital
levels fall below prescribed levels. The minimum CCB in 2016 is 0.625% and increases 0.625% annually through 2019 to 2.5%. The
CCB for the Bank at September 30, 2016 was 4.96%. 

Set forth below is a summary of the Bank s compliance with banking regulatory capital
standards. 

The Holding Company is subject to the same regulatory capital requirements
as the Bank. As of September 30, 2016, the Holding Company continues to be categorized as  well-capitalized  under
the prompt corrective action regulations and continues to exceed all regulatory capital requirements. The CCB for the Holding Company
at September 30, 2016 was 4.87%.

16.          New
Authoritative Accounting Pronouncements  

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments , to clarify how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statements
of cash flows. The amendments are intended to reduce diversity in practice by clarifying whether the following items should be
categorized as operating, investing or financing in the statement of cash flows: (i) debt prepayments and extinguishment costs,
(ii) settlement of zero-coupon debt, (iii) settlement of contingent consideration, (iv) insurance proceeds, (v) settlement of corporate-owned
life insurance (COLI) and bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies, (vi) distributions from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial
interests in securitization transactions, and (viii) receipts and payments with aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The
ASU will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early
adoption is permitted. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of
the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the
amendments in the same period. The Company does not expect adoption of this ASU will have a material affect on its consolidated
financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial
Instruments   Credit Losses  which sets forth a  current expected credit loss  ( CECL ) model
which requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on
historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model
and will apply to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and to some off-balance sheet
credit exposures. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , which introduces targeted amendments intended to simplify the
accounting for stock compensation. Specifically, the ASU requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits
of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The tax
effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity
also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces
taxes payable in the current period. That is, off balance sheet accounting for net operating losses stemming from excess tax benefits
would no longer be required and instead such net operating losses would be recognized when they arise. Existing net operating losses
that are currently tracked off balance sheet would be recognized, net of a valuation allowance if required, through an adjustment
to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. Entities will no longer need to maintain and track an additional paid in
capital pool. The ASU also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating
activity in the statement of cash flows. In addition, the ASU elevates the statutory tax withholding threshold to qualify for equity
classification up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction(s). The ASU also clarifies that cash paid by
an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. The ASU
provides an optional accounting policy election (with limited exceptions), to be applied on an entity-wide basis, to either estimate
the number of awards that are expected to vest (consistent with existing GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. The
amendments are effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance
on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases . From the lessee's perspective, the new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU )
model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer
than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense
recognition in the income statement for a lessee. From the lessor's perspective, the new standard requires a lessor to classify
leases as either sales-type, finance or operating. A lease will be treated as a sale if it transfers all of the risks and rewards,
as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee. If risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control, the
lease is treated as a financing. If the lessor doesn t convey risks and rewards or control, an operating lease results. The
new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into
after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients
available. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessors for sales-type, direct financing, and operating
leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements,
with certain practical expedients available.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our
consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 

In January 2016, FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-01  Financial Instruments  which requires an entity to: (i) measure equity investments at fair
value through net income, with certain exceptions; (ii) present in other comprehensive income the changes in instrument-specific
credit risk for financial liabilities measured using the fair value option; (iii) present financial assets and financial liabilities
by measurement category and form of financial asset; (iv) calculate the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes
based on an exit price and; (v) assess a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses of available for
sale debt securities in combination with other deferred tax assets. The ASU provides an election to subsequently measure certain
nonmarketable equity investments at cost less any impairment and adjusted for certain observable price changes. The ASU also requires
a qualitative impairment assessment of such equity investments and amends certain fair value disclosure requirements.   The
amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted for the changes that affect the Company.  We are currently evaluating
the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

Executive Summary   

We are a Delaware corporation organized in May
1994. The Bank was organized in 1929 as a New York State-chartered mutual savings bank. The Bank converted from a federally chartered
mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank on November 21, 1995, at which time Flushing Financial Corporation
acquired all of the stock of the Bank. In 2013, the Bank s charter was changed to a full-service New York State chartered
commercial bank, and its name was changed to Flushing Bank. As a result of the Bank s change in charter to a full-service
New York State chartered commercial bank, the Bank s primary regulator became the New York State Department of Financial
Services, and its primary federal regulator became the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). Deposits are
insured to the maximum allowable amount by the FDIC. Additionally, the Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. The
primary business of Flushing Financial Corporation has been the operation of the Bank. The Bank owns three subsidiaries: Flushing
Preferred Funding Corporation, Flushing Service Corporation, and FSB Properties Inc. The Bank also operates an internet branch,
iGObanking.com   . The activities of Flushing Financial Corporation are primarily funded by dividends, if any, received
from the Bank, issuances of junior subordinated debt, and issuances of equity securities. Flushing Financial Corporation s
common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol  FFIC.  

Our principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general
public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from ongoing operations and borrowings, primarily in (1) originations
and purchases of multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans and, to a lesser
extent, one-to-four family loans (focusing on mixed-use properties, which are properties that contain both residential dwelling
units and commercial units); (2) Small Business Administration ( SBA ) loans and other small business loans; (3) construction
loans, primarily for residential properties; (4) mortgage loan surrogates such as mortgage-backed securities; and (5) U.S. government
securities, corporate fixed-income securities and other marketable securities. We also originate certain other consumer loans including
overdraft lines of credit. Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the
income earned on its interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the result
of our interest rate margin, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average
cost of interest-bearing liabilities, adjusted for the difference in the average balance of interest-earning assets as compared
to the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. We also generate non-interest income from loan fees, service charges on
deposit accounts, mortgage servicing fees, and other fees, income earned on Bank Owned Life Insurance ( BOLI ), dividends
on Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock and net gains and losses on sales of securities and loans. Our operating expenses consist
principally of employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses and
income tax expense. Our results of operations also can be significantly affected by changes in the fair value of financial assets
and financial liabilities for which changes in value are recorded through earnings, our periodic provision for loan losses and
specific provision for losses on real estate owned. 

PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

  FLUSHING FINANCIAL CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES  

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of  

  Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Our strategy is to continue our focus on being an institution serving
consumers, businesses, and governmental units in our local markets. In furtherance of this objective, we intend to: 

continue our emphasis on the origination of multi-family residential mortgage loans, commercial
business loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans;   

increase our commitment to the multi-cultural marketplace, with a particular focus on the Asian
community in Queens;   

maintain asset quality;   

manage deposit growth and maintain a low cost of funds through   

business banking deposits,   

personal accounts,   

municipal deposits through government banking, and   

new customer relationships via iGObanking.com    

building relationships with our lending and deposit customers;   

take advantage of market disruptions to attract talent and customers from competitors;   

manage interest rate risk and capital; and   

manage enterprise-wide risk.   

There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement
this strategy. Our strategy is subject to change by the Board of Directors. 

Our investment policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors,
is designed primarily to manage the interest rate sensitivity of our overall assets and liabilities, to generate a favorable return
without incurring undue interest rate risk and credit risk, to complement our lending activities and to provide and maintain liquidity.
In establishing our investment strategies, we consider our business and growth strategies, the economic environment, our interest
rate risk exposure, our interest rate sensitivity  gap  position, the types of securities to be held and other factors.
We classify our investment securities as available for sale or held-to-maturity. 

We carry a portion of our financial assets and financial liabilities
at fair value and record changes in their fair value through earnings in non-interest income on our Consolidated Statements of
Income and Comprehensive Income. A description of the financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value
through earnings can be found in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Our net interest margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 2.94%,
a decrease of five basis points from the trailing quarter. Included in net interest income are prepayment penalties on loans and
securities and interest recovered from non-accrual loans. Absent prepayment penalty income and recovered interest, the net interest
margin would have decreased by six basis points to 2.81% for the third quarter of 2016 from 2.87% for the second quarter of 2016. 

The trend of improving credit quality continued during the
three months ended September 30, 2016, as we continued to see improvements in classified assets. Classified assets were $48.7
million at September 30, 2016, which was an increase of $3.9 million, or 8.7%, from June 30, 2016, while non-accrual loans
increased $1.5 million, or 7.4%, during the third quarter to $21.9 million. Net charge-offs for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 were $0.4 million. Our strong underwriting standards coupled with our practice of obtaining updated
appraisals and recording charge-offs, when necessary, has resulted in a 54.5% average loan-to-value ratio on our collateral
dependent loans reviewed for impairment at September 30, 2016. 

Net loans increased $45.4 million, or 1.0%, during the third quarter
of 2016. Loan originations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $233.2 million. During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, originations were primarily multi-family real estate, commercial real estate and commercial business loans
as originations of these loan types accounted for 92.1% of the quarter s originations. The weighted average yield on loan
originations and purchases was 3.74% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 3.71% and 3.56% for the quarters ended June 30,
2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Loan applications in process were $289.3 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $329.8
million at June 30, 2016. We have begun to execute on the strategy change to increase net interest income through increasing rates
as opposed to increasing volume. The interest rates on our mortgage loan pipeline increased 11 basis points to 4.05% from 3.94%
at June 30, 2016. This strategy shift positions the Company to reap the benefits of an increase in rates.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of  

  Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The Bank and Company are subject to the same regulatory capital
requirements. At September 30, 2016, the Bank and Company were considered to be well-capitalized under all regulatory requirements.
At September 30, 2016, the Bank s capital ratios for Tier 1 leverage, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-based, and Total
Risk-based capital were 8.88%, 12.44%, 12.44% and 12.96%, respectively. At September 30, 2016, the Company s capital ratios
for Tier 1 leverage, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Risk-based, and Total Risk-based capital were 8.80%, 11.72%, 12.35% and 12.87%,
respectively. 

COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

General.   Net income for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was $10.6 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 3.4%, compared to $11.0 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $0.01, or 2.6%,
from $0.38 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Return on average equity was 8.4% for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to 9.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Return on average assets was 0.7% for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Interest Income.   Interest and dividend income increased
$3.6 million, or 7.0%, to $55.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $51.9 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase of $533.4 million in the average
balance of interest-earning assets to $5,684.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $5,151.0 million for
the comparable prior year period, partially offset by a decrease of 12 basis points in the yield on interest-earning assets to
3.91% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.03% in the comparable prior year period. The decline in the yield on
interest-earning assets of 12 basis points was primarily due to a 25 basis point reduction in the yield on total loans, net to
4.20% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.45% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The yield on interest-earning
assets was positively impacted by an increase of $616.9 million in the average balance of higher yielding total loans, net to $4,686.6
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $4,069.7 million for the comparable prior year period. Additionally,
the yield on the securities portfolio increased two basis points to 2.66% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from 2.64%
for the comparable prior year period. The 25 basis point decrease in the yield on the total loans, net was primarily due to the
decline in the rates earned on new loan originations and purchases, as compared to the existing portfolio, loans modifying to lower
rates, and higher yielding loans prepaying. Excluding prepayment penalty income and recovered interest from loans, the yield on
total loans, net, would have decreased 16 basis points to 4.05% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.21% for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Interest Expense.   Interest expense increased $1.2
million, or 9.6%, to $13.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $12.6 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increases of $416.5 million in the average balance of
interest-bearing liabilities to $5,059.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $4,643.2 million for the comparable
prior year period and four basis points in the cost of total deposits to 0.92% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
0.88% for the comparable prior year period. This increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease of 16 basis points
in the cost of borrowed funds to 1.58% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.74% for the comparable prior year period.
The increase in the cost of total deposits was primarily due to increases of 23 basis points, 10 basis points and two basis points
in the cost of money market, NOW and savings accounts, respectively. The cost of money market accounts increased primarily due
to our shifting Government NOW deposits to a money market product which does not require us to provide collateral, allowing us
to invest these funds in higher yielding assets. The cost of NOW and savings accounts both increased primarily due to an increase
in the rate we pay on some of our products to attract additional deposits. These increases were partially offset by a decrease
of six basis points in the cost of certificates of deposit, primarily resulting from maturing issuances being replaced at lower
rates. The decrease in the cost of borrowed funds was primarily due to maturing and new borrowings being replaced and obtained
at lower rates.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of  

  Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Net Interest Income.   For the three months ended September
30, 2016, net interest income was $41.7 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 6.1%, from $39.3 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase of $533.4 million in the average
balance of interest-earning assets to $5,684.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $5,151.0 million for
the comparable prior year period. The yield earned on interest-earning assets decreased 12 basis points to 3.91% for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 from 4.03% for the comparable prior year period. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 1.09% for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The effects of the above on both the net interest spread and net interest margin
were decreases of 12 basis points to 2.82% and 11 basis points to 2.94%, respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Included in net interest income was prepayment penalty income from loans and
securities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaling $1.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively, along with
recovered interest from non-accrual loans totaling $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Excluding prepayment penalty income
and recovered interest, the net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 would have been 2.81%, a decrease
of four basis points, as compared to 2.85% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Benefit for Loan Losses.   During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, no provision for loan losses was recorded, compared to a benefit of $0.4 million recorded during the comparable
prior year period. No provision was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to the quarterly analysis of
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses indicating that the reserve was at an appropriate level. During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, the Bank recorded net charge-offs totaling $0.4 million and non-accrual loans increased $1.5 million
to $21.9 million from $20.4 million at June 30, 2016. The current average loan-to-value ratio for our non-performing loans collateralized
by real estate was 40.3% at September 30, 2016. The Bank continues to maintain conservative underwriting standards. We anticipate
that we will continue to see low loss content in our loan portfolio. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 Loans  and  -ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.  

Non-Interest Income.   Non-interest income for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.9 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 9.2%, from $1.7 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to a decrease of $0.3 million in net losses from
fair value adjustments as compared to the prior year comparable period. 

Non-Interest Expense.   Non-interest expense was $26.3
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $2.6 million, or 10.8%, from $23.7 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase of $2.1 million in salaries
and benefits primarily due to annual salary increases and additions in staffing in retail, audit and compliance departments. The
three months ended September 30, 2016 also included an $0.8 million write-down on one OREO. The efficiency ratio was 57.4% for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 56.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Income before Income Taxes.   Income before the provision
for income taxes decreased $0.4 million, or 2.2%, to $17.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $17.7 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 for the reasons discussed above. 

Provision for Income Taxes.   The provision for income
taxes was $6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The effective tax rate increased to 38.5% for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 from 37.7% in the comparable prior year period due to the reduced impact of preferential
tax items. 

COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  

General.   Net income for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $50.6 million, an increase of $16.1 million, or 46.4%, compared to $34.6 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Diluted earnings per common share were $1.75 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $0.57, or 48.3%,
from $1.18 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Return on average equity increased to 13.7% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 from 10.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Return on average assets increased to 1.1% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the gain on sale
of buildings increased $27.3 million to $33.8 million from $6.5 million for the comparable prior year period. Absent this increase
from the gain on sale of buildings, the return on average equity and the return on average assets would have been 9.3% and 0.8%,
respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of  

  Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Interest Income.   Total interest and dividend income
increased $13.3 million, or 8.8%, to $165.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $151.7 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase of $579.8 million in
the average balance of interest-earning assets to $5,596.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5,016.5 million
for the comparable prior year period, partially offset by a decrease of 10 basis points in the yield on interest-earning assets
to 3.93% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.03% in the comparable prior year period. The decline in the yield
on interest-earning assets of 10 basis points was primarily due to a 21 basis point reduction in the yield on total loans, net
to 4.26% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.47% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The yield on interest-earning
assets was positively impacted by an increase of $580.9 million in the average balance of higher yielding total loans, net to $4,548.2
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $3,967.2 million for the comparable prior year period. Additionally,
the yield on the securities portfolio increased 13 basis points to 2.65% for nine months ended September 30, 2016, from 2.52% for
the comparable prior year period. The 21 basis point decrease in the yield on total loans, net was primarily due to the decline
in the rates earned on new loan originations and purchases, as compared to the existing portfolio, loans modifying to lower rates,
and higher yielding loans prepaying. Excluding prepayment penalty income and recovered interest from loans, the yield on total
loans, net, would have decreased 18 basis points to 4.09% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.27% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The 13 basis point increase in the yield on the securities portfolio was primarily due to the
current year including $97.2 million in purchases at an average yield on 2.76%. 

Interest Expense.   Interest expense increased $3.6
million, or 9.7%, to $40.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $36.7 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase of $495.7 million in the average balance of interest-bearing
liabilities to $5,021.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $4,526.2 million for the comparable prior year
period. This increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease of six basis points in the cost of borrowed funds
to 1.69% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.75% for the comparable prior year period. The cost of total deposits
was 0.87% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the cost of certificates
of deposit decreased 12 basis points from the comparable prior period, resulting from maturing issuances being replaced at lower
rates. This decrease was offset by increases of 21 basis points, six basis points and three basis points in the cost of money market,
NOW and savings accounts, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable prior year period. The
cost of money market accounts increased primarily due to our shifting Government NOW deposits to a money market product which does
not require us to provide collateral, allowing us to invest these funds in higher yielding assets. The cost of NOW and savings
accounts both increased primarily due to an increase in the rate we pay on some of our products to attract additional deposits.
The decrease in the cost of borrowed funds was primarily due to maturing and new borrowings being replaced and obtained at lower
rates. 

Net Interest Income.   For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, net interest income was $124.7 million, an increase of $9.7 million, or 8.5%, from $115.0 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase of $579.8 million in the average
balance of interest-earning assets to $5,596.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5,016.5 million for the
comparable prior year period. The yield earned on interest-earning assets decreased 10 basis points to 3.93% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 from 4.03% for the comparable prior year period. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased one
basis point to 1.07% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 1.08% for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The effects of the above on both the net interest spread and net interest margin were decreases of nine basis points to 2.86%
and 2.97%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Included
in net interest income was prepayment penalty income from loans and securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 totaling $5.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively, along with recovered interest from non-accrual loans totaling $0.5 million
and $1.2 million, respectively. Excluding the prepayment penalty income and recovered interest, the net interest margin for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 would have been 2.84%, a decrease of five basis points, as compared to 2.89% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Benefit for Loan Losses.   During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, no provision for loan losses was recorded, compared to a benefit of $1.6 million recorded during the comparable
prior year period. No provision was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the quarterly analysis of the
adequacy of the allowance for loan losses indicating that the reserve was at an appropriate level. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Bank recorded net recoveries totaling $0.3 million and non-accrual loans decreased $0.9 million to $21.9
million from $22.8 million at December 31, 2015. The current average loan-to-value ratio for our non-performing loans collateralized
by real estate was 40.3% at September 30, 2016. The Bank continues to maintain conservative underwriting standards. We anticipate
that we will continue to see low loss content in our loan portfolio. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 Loans  and  -ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of  

  Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Non-Interest Income.   Non-interest income for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was $42.1 million, an increase of $28.5 million, or 210.2%, from $13.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to increases of $27.3 million in net gains on sale
of buildings and $2.2 million in net gains on sale of securities, partially offset by an increase of $2.0 million in net losses
from fair value adjustments as compared to the prior year comparable period. 

Non-Interest Expense.   Non-interest expense was $83.2
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $9.3 million, or 12.6%, from $73.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase of $4.6 million in salaries and
benefits primarily due to annual salary increases and additions in staffing in retail, audit and compliance departments, as well
as increases in production incentives and the cost of split dollar life insurance benefits. The nine months ended September 30,
2016 also included a penalty of $2.1 million on the prepayment of $38.0 million in repurchase agreements and $1.6 million write-down
on one OREO. Additionally, the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included increases of $0.9 million in professional services
expense from increased legal and consulting expenses, $0.7 million in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily due to the
opening of two new branches along with the move to our new corporate headquarters both occurring in 2015 and $0.5 million in other
operating expense due to the growth of the Bank. The efficiency ratio was 59.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to 59.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Income before Income Taxes.   Income before the provision
for income taxes increased $27.3 million, or 48.5%, to $83.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $56.3 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 for the reasons discussed above. 

Provision for Income Taxes.   The provision for income
taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $33.0 million, an increase of $11.3 million, or 51.8%, from $21.7 million
for the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $27.3 million in income before income taxes,
and an increase in the effective tax rate to 39.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 38.6% in the comparable prior
year period. The increase in the effective tax rate reflects the reduced impact of preferential tax items as a result of the increase
in the gain on sale of buildings. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION   

Assets.   Total assets at September 30, 2016 were $5,999.3
million, an increase of $294.6 million, or 5.2%, from $5,704.6 million at December 31, 2015. Total loans, net increased $353.0
million, or 8.1%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $4,719.5 million from $4,366.4 million at December 31, 2015.
Loan originations and purchases were $850.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $12.5 million,
or 1.5%, from $837.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we
continued to focus on the origination of multi-family residential, commercial real estate and commercial business loans with a
full relationship. The loan pipeline totaled $289.3 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $330.5 million at December 31, 2015.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of  

  Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following table shows loan originations and purchases for the
periods indicated: 

The Bank maintains its conservative underwriting standards that
include, among other things, a loan-to-value ratio of 75% or less and a debt coverage ratio of at least 125%. Multi-family residential
(excluding underlying co-operative mortgages), commercial real estate and one-to-four family mixed-use property mortgage loans
originated during the third quarter of 2016 had an average loan-to-value ratio of 41.9% and an average debt coverage ratio of 204%. 

The Bank s non-performing assets totaled $26.4 million at
September 30, 2016, a decrease of $4.6 million, or 14.9%, from $31.0 million at December 31, 2015. Total non-performing assets
as a percentage of total assets were 0.44% at September 30, 2016 compared to 0.54% at December 31, 2015. The ratio of allowance
for loan losses to total non-performing loans was 92.6% at September 30, 2016 and 82.6% at December 31, 2015. Performing troubled
debt restructured loans totaled $8.2 million at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 13.7%, from $9.5 million at
December 31, 2015. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, mortgage-backed
securities decreased $123.7 million, or 18.5%, to $545.1 million from $668.7 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in mortgage-backed
securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to sales of $64.6 million at an average yield on 3.03%
and principal repayments of $79.8 million, which were partially offset by purchases of $13.1 million at an average yield on 2.65%
and an increase of $9.2 million in the fair value of mortgage-backed securities. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other securities
held-to-maturity, increased $27.1 million, or 438.4%, to $33.3 million from $6.2 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in
other securities held-to-maturity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to purchases of $35.7 million
at an average yield on 2.37%, which was partially offset by maturities totaling $8.5 million. Other securities held-to-maturity
primarily consist of municipal bonds. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other securities
available for sale, increased $41.2 million, or 12.7%, to $365.8 million from $324.7 million at December 31, 2015. The increase
in other securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to purchases of $48.4 million at an average
yield on 3.07% and an increase of $0.5 million in the fair value of other securities, which was partially offset by maturities
totaling $6.0 million. Other securities available for sale primarily consist of securities issued by mutual or bond funds that
invest in government and government agency securities, municipal bonds, collateralized loan obligations and corporate bonds.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of  

  Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Liabilities.   Total liabilities were $5,486.6 million
at September 30, 2016, an increase of $255.1 million, or 4.9%, from $5,231.6 million at December 31, 2015. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, due to depositors increased $136.8 million, or 3.5%, to $3,992.5 million, due to increases of $155.6
million in core deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $18.8 million in certificates of deposit. The increase in core deposits
was due to increases of $260.9 million and $50.6 million in money market and demand accounts, respectively, partially offset by
decreases of $152.2 million and $3.7 million in NOW and savings accounts, respectively. Borrowed funds increased $88.8 million
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in borrowed funds was primarily due to a net increase in short-term
borrowings to replace the seasonal outflow of Government deposits which are expected to return during the quarter ended December
31, 2016. 

Equity.   Total stockholders  equity increased
$39.6 million, or 8.4%, to $512.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $473.1 million at December 31, 2015. Stockholders  equity
increased primarily due to net income of $50.6 million, an increase in other comprehensive income totaling $5.8 million, primarily
due to an increase in the fair value of the securities portfolio and the net impact of $5.4 million from the vesting and exercising
of shares of employee and director stock plans. These increases were partially offset by the declaration and payment of dividends
on the Company s common stock of $0.51 per common share totaling $14.8 million and the purchase of 378,695 treasury shares,
at an average price of $19.78 per share, for a total cost of $7.5 million. Book value per common share was $17.90 at September
30, 2016 compared to $16.41 at December 31, 2015. 

Cash flow.   During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, funds provided by the Company's operating activities amounted to $37.4 million. These funds combined with $215.1 million
provided from financing activities were utilized to fund net investing activities of $246.9 million. The Company's primary business
objective is the origination and purchase of multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans and commercial real estate
mortgage loans and to a lesser extent one-to-four family (including mixed-use properties) and SBA loans. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the net total of loan originations and purchases less loan repayments and sales was $348.5 million. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company also funded purchases of $59.7 million in securities available for sale and
$35.7 million in securities held-to-maturity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, funds were provided by net increases
in short-term borrowing of $150.0 million and total deposits of $148.6 million. Additionally, funds were provided by $152.8 million
in proceeds from maturities, sales, calls and prepayments of securities available for sale and the sale of buildings totaling $34.3
million. In addition to funding loan growth, these funds were used to repay $60.3 million in long-term borrowings. The Company
also used funds of $14.8 million and $9.1 million for dividend payments and purchases of treasury stock, respectively, during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

INTEREST RATE RISK   

The Consolidated Statements of Financial Position have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial
position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in fair value of certain investments
due to changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of financial investments such as loans and securities fluctuates inversely
with changes in interest rates. As a result, increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of the Company s
interest-earning assets which could adversely affect the Company s results of operations if such assets were sold, or, in
the case of securities classified as available-for-sale, decreases in the Company s stockholders  equity, if such securities
were retained.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of  

  Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The Company manages the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities on a continuous basis to maximize return and adjust its exposure to interest rate risk. On a quarterly basis, management
prepares the  Earnings and Economic Exposure to Changes in Interest Rate  report for review by the Asset Liability
Committee of the Board of Directors, as summarized below. This report quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and
net portfolio value should interest rates go up or down (shocked) 200 basis points, assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks
will be parallel to each other. The Company s regulators currently place focus on the net portfolio value, focusing on a
rate shock up or down of 200 basis points. Net portfolio value is defined as the market value of assets net of the market value
of liabilities. The market value of assets and liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation. The net portfolio
value ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value to the market value of assets. All changes in income and value are measured
as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario. The base
interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at September 30, 2016. Various estimates regarding prepayment assumptions are made
at each level of rate shock. However, prepayment penalty income is excluded from this analysis. Actual results could differ significantly
from these estimates. At September 30, 2016, the Company was within the guidelines set forth by the Board of Directors for each
interest rate level. 

The following table presents the Company s interest rate shock
as of September 30, 2016:

AVERAGE BALANCES   

Net interest income represents the difference between income on
interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends upon the relative amount of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them. The following table sets forth certain information
relating to the Company s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Income for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods
indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively,
for the periods shown. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The yields include amortization of fees which
are considered adjustments to yields. 

(1)    Loan
                                         interest income includes loan fee income (which includes net amortization of deferred
                                         fees and costs, late charges, and prepayment penalties) of approximately $0.9 million
                                         and $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    

(2)    Interest
                                         income on tax-exempt securities does not include the tax benefit of the tax-exempt securities.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCUTURED ( TDR ) AND NON-PERFORMING ASSETS   

Management continues to adhere to the Company s conservative
underwriting standards. At times, the Company may restructure a loan to enable a borrower to continue making payments when it is
deemed to be in the best long-term interest of the Company. This restructure may include making concessions to the borrower that
the Company would not make in the normal course of business, such as reducing the interest rate until the next reset date, extending
the amortization period thereby lowering the monthly payments, or changing the loan to interest only payments for a limited time
period. At times, certain problem loans have been restructured by combining more than one of these options. The Company believes
that restructuring these loans in this manner will allow certain borrowers to become and remain current on their loans. The Company
classifies these loans as TDR. Loans which have been current for six consecutive months at the time they are restructured as TDR
remain on accrual status. Loans which were delinquent at the time they are restructured as a TDR are placed on non-accrual status
until they have made timely payments for six consecutive months. Loans that are restructured as TDR but are not performing in accordance
with the restructured terms are excluded from the TDR table below, as they are placed on non-accrual status and reported as non-performing
loans. 

The following table shows loans classified as TDR that are performing
according to their restructured terms at the periods indicated: 

Subsequent to September 30, 2016, one taxi medallion relationship
totaling $6.8 million was approved to be restuructured as a TDR. The TDR was approved to receive a below market interest rate.

CRITICIZED AND CLASSIFIED ASSETS   

Our policy is to review our assets, focusing primarily on the loan
portfolio, OREO and the investment portfolios, to ensure that the credit quality is maintained at the highest levels. When weaknesses
are identified, immediate action is taken to correct the problem through direct contact with the borrower or issuer. We then monitor
these assets, and, in accordance with our policy and current regulatory guidelines, we designate them as  Special Mention, 
which is considered a  Criticized Asset,  and  Substandard,   Doubtful,  or  Loss 
which are considered  Classified Assets,  as deemed necessary. These loan designations are updated quarterly. We designate
an asset as Substandard when a well-defined weakness is identified that jeopardizes the orderly liquidation of the debt. We designate
an asset as Doubtful when it displays the inherent weakness of a Substandard asset with the added provision that collection of
the debt in full, on the basis of existing facts, is highly improbable. We designate an asset as Loss if it is deemed the debtor
is incapable of repayment. We do not hold any loans designated as loss, as loans that are designated as Loss are charged to the
Allowance for Loan Losses. Assets that are non-accrual are designated as Substandard or Doubtful. We designate an asset as Special
Mention if the asset does not warrant designation within one of the other categories, but does contain a potential weakness that
deserves closer attention. Our total Criticized and Classified assets were $66.3 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of
$11.5 million from $54.8 million at December 31, 2015.

On a quarterly basis all collateral dependent loans that are classified
as Substandard or Doubtful are internally reviewed for impairment, based on updated cash flows for income producing properties,
or updated independent appraisals. The loan balances of collateral dependent loans reviewed for impairment are then compared to
the loans updated fair value. We consider fair value of collateral dependent loans to be 85% of the appraised or internally estimated
value of the property, except for taxi medallion loans. The balance which exceeds fair value is generally charged-off, except for
taxi medallion loans. The fair value of the underlying collateral of taxi medallion loans is the value of the underlying medallion
based upon the most recently reported arm s length transaction. When there is no recent sale activity, the fair value is
calculated using capitalization rates. Taxi medallion loans with a loan-to-value greater than 100% are classified as impaired and
allocated a portion of the allowance for loan losses ( ALL ) in the amount of the excess of the loan-to-value over
the loan s principal balance. At September 30, 2016, the current average loan-to-value ratio on our collateral dependent
loans reviewed for impairment was 54.5%.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of  

  Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES   

The ALL represents the expense charged to earnings based upon management s
quarterly analysis of credit risk. The amount of the ALL is based upon multiple factors which reflects management s assessment
of the credit quality of the loan portfolio. The factors are both quantitative and qualitative in nature including, but not limited
to, historical losses, economic conditions, trends in delinquencies, value and adequacy of underlying collateral, volume and portfolio
mix, and internal loan processes. 

Management has developed a comprehensive analytical process to monitor
the adequacy of the ALL. The process and guidelines were developed using, among other factors, the guidance from federal banking
regulatory agencies and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The results of this process,
along with the conclusions of our independent loan review officer, support management s assessment as to the adequacy of
the ALL at each balance sheet date. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  Loans  for a
detailed explanation of management s methodology and policy. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2106, the portion of
the ALL related to the loss history declined. Charge-offs recorded in the past twelve quarters have decreased as credit conditions
have improved. The percentage of loans originated prior to 2009, compared to the total loan portfolio, is decreasing as scheduled
amortization and repayments have occurred. As disclosed in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  Loans ,
the loans originated prior to 2009 have a higher delinquency and loss rate. These reductions in the ALL were partially offset by
an additional allocation to our taxi medallion portfolio coupled with an increase in the outstanding loan balances. The impact
from the above and the recorded net recoveries during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in the ALL totaling $21.8
million, an increase of $0.3 million, from December 31, 2015. Based upon management consistently applying the ALL methodology and
review of the loan portfolio, management concluded a charge to earnings to increase the ALL was not warranted. The ALL at September
30, 2016, represented 0.46% of gross loans outstanding as compared to 0.49% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2015. The
ALL represented 92.6% of non-performing loans at September 30, 2016 compared to 82.6% at December 31, 2015. The ratio of net charge-offs
to average total loans was a benefit of 0.01% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net charge offs of 0.02%
for the comparable 2015 period. 

As a component of the credit risk assessment, the Bank has established
an Asset Classification Committee which carefully evaluates loans which are past due 90 days and/or are classified. The Asset Classification
Committee thoroughly assesses the condition and circumstances surrounding each loan meeting the criteria. The Bank also has a Delinquency
Committee which evaluates loans meeting specific criteria. The Bank s loan policy requires loans to be placed into non-accrual
status once the loan becomes 90 days delinquent unless they are well secured and in the process of collection or they are past
maturity but continue making payments and are in the process of renegotiation. The Portfolio Management department reviews all
loans greater than $650,000 annually. 

Management recommends to the Board of Directors the amount of the
ALL quarterly. The Board of Directors approves the ALL.
