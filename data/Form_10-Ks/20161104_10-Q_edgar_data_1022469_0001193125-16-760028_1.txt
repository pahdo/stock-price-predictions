  DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION  
 AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements     Note 1   Accounting Policies   
  Basis of Presentation     The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Deltic Timber Corporation (the  Company  or  Deltic ). Certain information and accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although management of the Company believes
the disclosures contained herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, these consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets, and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.    Management believes the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, including normal
recurring accruals and adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary to present fairly its financial position as of September 30, 2016, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. These consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued.
    Recently Issued Authoritative Accounting Pronouncements and Guidance   
 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2016-02,
 Leases , which supersedes Topic 840 and among other things, requires lessees to recognize most leases on-balance sheet. The new standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and is not expected to have a material
impact on its financial statements.    On March 30, 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting . This ASU changes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments award transactions, including accounting for income taxes, classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, forfeitures, minimum
statutory tax withholding requirements, and the classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. This update will be effective for the Company on January 1,
2017. The Company is evaluating what effect ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.    In
June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The ASU changes the way entities recognize impairment of many financial assets by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses
expected to occur over their remaining life. This update will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on its financial statements.

   Note 4   Timber and Timberlands (cont.)   
   
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, Deltic acquired 220 acres of
timberland for $514,000, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 623 acres of timberland were acquired for $1,207,000. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, Deltic had no acquisitions of timberlands. The total number
of timberland acres acquired in the first nine months of 2015 was 344, inclusive of 304 acres acquired for cash payments of $581,000 and 40 acres acquired in a non-cash exchange transaction. The timberlands acquired in both 2016 and 2015 were
located in the Company s current operating area. Deltic invests in and holds strategic fee timber as a productive asset, and any expenditure to acquire such timber and timberlands is an investing activity on the Company s Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.    In 1999, the Company initiated a program to identify and sell non-strategic timberlands and use the sales
proceeds to purchase pine timberlands that are strategic to its operations. In 2008, Deltic identified approximately 10,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands that existed within its timberlands base to be sold. Other non-strategic acreage exists
within the Company s land base, but Deltic has not completely identified the number of acres that fit within this category. As the Company identifies these acres and determines that they are either smaller tracts of pine timberlands that cannot
be strategically managed or tracts of hardwood bottomland that cannot be converted into pine-growing acreage, they will be sold. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 241 acres of these lands were available for sale.  
 There were no gains from sales of timberland included in the Woodlands operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to $6,000 in the same period of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were timber gains included in the Woodlands operating income of $33,000 and $102,000, respectively. Occasionally Deltic engages in
land-for-land exchanges that are recorded as sales due to the nature of the land involved. For the nine months ending September 30, 2015, $25,000 of gains was included in operating income from non-monetary exchanges, and there were no such
gains in the same period of 2016.     Note 5   Property, Plant, and Equipment

    Note 8   Credit Facilities   
 Effective January 6, 2016, Deltic entered into a second amendment to the Company s Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit
Agreement with the consent of the lenders thereto, in which it exercised the first of its two options and extended the termination date by one year to November 17, 2020.  
 On February 4, 2016, and pursuant to its Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, Deltic elected to replace two lenders in
the Credit Agreement. Accordingly the respective rights and obligations of Wells Fargo Bank, NA and Branch Banking and Trust Company were assigned to one new lender, Greenstone Farm Credit Services, ACA, and one existing lender, American AgCredit,
PCA, in the amounts of $27,000,000 and $123,000,000, respectively.    On July 29, 2016, the Company utilized a portion of the $50
million letter of credit component available under its revolving credit facility to replace the letter of credit that supports the Union County, Arkansas Taxable Industrial Revenue Bonds that total $29,000,000, and was scheduled to expire on
August 31, 2016. With this, the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility was reduced by the amount of the letter of credit issued.

  DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION  
 AND SUBSIDIARIES    Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements     Note 9   Income Taxes   
 The Company s effective income tax rate for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was 38 percent and 33 percent,
respectively. This compares to an effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 of 66 percent and 37 percent, respectively. The lower rate was due to the benefit of a lower income tax rate on sales of timber
held 15 years or longer during the year of 2016. At September 30, 2016, there were no unrecognized tax benefits recorded on the balance sheet. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state examinations by tax authorities for years
before 2013.     Note 10   Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans   
 Components of net periodic retirement expense and other postretirement benefits expense consisted of the following:

   Note 10   Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans (cont.)   
   
  The Company made contributions to its qualified plan of $750,000 during the first nine months
of 2016, and expects to fund the plan with an additional $300,000 over the remainder of 2016. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is 7.50 percent. Effective January 1, 2015, Deltic closed the defined benefit funded
retirement plan to any new or rehired salaried and hourly non-represented entrants. In connection with this closure, additional Company 401(k) contributions are made for all employees hired on or after that date.

respectively, of stock-based compensation expense reflected in general and administrative expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the amounts were $2,586,000 and $2,503,000, respectively.

   Stock Options    A summary of stock options as of September 30, 2016, and
changes during the nine months then ended are presented below:      
   The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above is the sum of the amounts by which the quoted market price of
the Company s common stock exceeded the exercise price of the options at September 30, 2016, for those options for which the quoted market price was in excess of the exercise price. This amount changes over time based on changes in the
fair market value of the Company s stock. As of September 30, 2016, there was $1,048,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9
years.     Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units    A summary of nonvested restricted stock as of September 30, 2016,

  As of September 30, 2016, there was $2,834,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related
to nonvested restricted stock. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.     Performance
Units    A summary of nonvested restricted stock performance units as of September 30, 2016, and changes during the nine months then ended are presented below:      
   As of September 30, 2016, there was $2,799,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
restricted stock performance units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2 years.     Note 13   Contingencies
    At various times, the Company may be involved in litigation incidental to its operations. Currently, there are no material legal
proceedings outstanding.     Note 14   Business Interruption Claim and Gain on Involuntary Conversion of Assets   
 On March 10, 2015, the Company experienced a fire at its MDF plant located in El Dorado, Arkansas. Damage was limited to the press portion
of the facility and operations at the facility were temporarily suspended while repairs were made to the damaged area. Most of the repairs were completed in April 2015 and the plant became fully operational in that month. The Company maintains
insurance coverage for both business interruption and property damage. Deltic settled the insurance claims during the second quarter and recorded the applicable income from the business interruption claim and gains on involuntary conversion of
assets in the operating income section of the consolidated income statement. The claim for business interruption insurance was settled for a total of $2,452,000, of which $516,000 was reported in Other Operating Income in the Company s
Consolidated Statements of Income for the quarter ending September 30, 2015 and $1,936,000 was a reimbursement of business operating expenses. The total deductible for the business interruption policy was approximately $948,000, $729,000 of
which was recognized as expense in the first quarter of 2015 and $219,000 was recognized as expense in the second quarter of 2015. The Company had adequate property damage insurance coverage to enable it to recover the replacement cost of its
property and equipment that was destroyed by the fire. During the second quarter, the Company settled property claims of $5,969,000 for property damage. The claims for property damage included $4,379,000 for inventory, contents, and

  repair costs, and $1,590,000 for replacement cost of a new press belt and DPA duct. The total
deductible for the property policy was $1,000,000, which was recognized as expense in the first quarter of 2015. After a write-off of basis in the amount of $886,000 for the old press belt and DPA duct in the first quarter of 2015, the Company
recognized a gain from involuntary conversion of assets in the amount of $704,000 which was reported in Other Operating Income in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income for the quarter ending June 30, 2015.  
  Note 15   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 Fair Value Measurement Accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, with Level 1
being the highest quality and Level 3 being the lowest quality. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets on identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. Level 3 inputs
are unobservable inputs which reflect assumptions about pricing by market participants.    The following is a description of the valuation
methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.     Nonqualified employee savings plan    Consists of mutual
funds, which are valued at the net asset value of shares held by the plan at the balance sheet date, at quoted market prices.    The fair
value measurements for the Company s financial liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016, are presented in the following table:

  The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial
instruments held by the Company at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The table
excludes financial instruments included in current assets and liabilities, except current maturities of long-term debt, all of which have fair values approximating carrying values.

determined for the basic earnings per common share computation plus the diluted effect of common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method.  
 The following table provides information about potentially dilutive securities that were outstanding but were not included in the computation

     Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations       Executive Overview    
 The Company reported net income of $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $.1 million for the same period of 2015. The
increase was primarily due to higher operating income for the Manufacturing segment, as a result of an improved lumber market, partially offset by increased Corporate general and administrative expense. The Woodlands segment reported $4.1 million in
operating income for the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $.4 million when compared to the third quarter of 2015, mainly as a result of reduced oil and gas-related income and a higher cost of fee timber harvested, partially offset by increased
revenues from pine sawtimber harvested. The Manufacturing segment reported $5.7 million in operating income, an improvement of $3.7 million from the $2 million of operating income reported a year ago, due to an increased average sales price for
lumber, combined with lower per-unit manufacturing cost for medium density fiberboard ( MDF ). The Real Estate segment reported an operating loss of $.2 million in the third quarter of both 2016 and 2015. Corporate segment operating
expense was $1.7 million higher in the current-year quarter than in the same period a year ago, mainly due to increased general and administrative expenses related to incentive plan costs and professional fees. Income tax expense increased $.8
million, compared to 2015 s third quarter, primarily due to increased pretax income, partially offset by the benefit of favorable capital gains tax rates applied to income from timber harvesting activity in 2016 s third quarter.  
 Deltic is a vertically integrated natural resources company operating in a commodity-based business environment that is engaged in the growing
and harvesting of timber and the manufacture and marketing of lumber and medium density fiberboard ( MDF ), with a major diversification in real estate development. The Company s operations and financial results are affected by a
number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, housing starts, general economic conditions, United States employment levels, interest rates, credit availability and associated costs, imports of lumber and MDF, foreign exchange rates, new
and existing home inventories, residential and commercial real estate foreclosures, residential and commercial repair and remodeling, commercial construction, industry capacity and production levels, the availability of raw materials, natural gas
pricing, and weather conditions. Even though new housing starts slowed in September, the improvement in the lumber market and the real estate market in Chenal Valley continued during the third quarter due to improving economic conditions in the
Little Rock area, Deltic has continued to close on sales of new residential lots developed in 2016. As with most commodity markets, the Company has little or no influence over pricing or demand levels for its wood products. Deltic s management
will continue to manage the Company s diverse asset base, maximize its vertical integration strategy, and use its size advantage to adjust production levels to capture market-driven opportunities.  
 The Woodlands segment is the Company s core operating segment, and its pine timberlands provide the foundation for Deltic s
vertically integrated structure, supplying the majority of raw material logs to Company sawmills. In the third quarter of 2016, the pine sawtimber harvest was 188,643 tons, an increase of 9,267 tons, or 5 percent, when compared to the 2015 third
quarter harvest of 179,376 tons. The average sales price for the pine sawtimber harvested was $28 per ton in the third quarter of 2016, a $1 increase when compared to prior-year third quarter. The pine pulpwood harvest in the current-year quarter
was 129,122 tons, an increase of 37,217 tons from the harvest in the third quarter of 2015, while the average sales price for the pine pulpwood harvested was $7 per ton for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $9 per ton in the prior-year third
quarter. While the pine pulpwood harvest increased 41 percent, prices have softened in markets within the Company s operating area. The increase in the harvest volume for pine sawtimber and pulpwood was mainly due to the timing of Deltic s
annual harvest plan, the mix of timber on the tracts being harvested, ongoing pine pulpwood thinning activities, and good logging conditions in the Company s operating region. The Company had no sales of non-strategic timberland during the
third quarter of 2016 compared to sales of 2 acres of non-strategic recreational-use hardwood bottomland at an average sales price of $4,300 per acre in the same period of 2015.  
 The Woodlands segment s financial results include other benefits from land ownership, such as revenues from hunting leases, mineral lease
rentals, mineral royalties, and land easements. Hunting lease revenue was $.8 million for the third quarter of both 2016 and 2015. Oil and gas lease rental income was $.1 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $.2 million in the third
quarter of 2015, as the amortization period of the prepaid lease rental payments received for the mineral leases for some  
      21

acreage has expired and these mineral acres are now held by production. Oil and gas royalty income, primarily from gas wells in the Fayetteville Shale Play, was $.4 million in the third quarter
of 2016, a $.3 million decrease from the third quarter of 2015, mainly due to 1) a decrease in natural gas prices, 2) the impact of declining production from the aging of existing gas wells, and 3) there being no new drilling activity in the
Fayetteville Shale Play to offset the decline in production. Deltic is currently receiving royalty income from 510 wells in the Fayetteville Shale Play, but the Company s income from mineral ownership in future periods is contingent on natural
gas and crude oil prices, successful completion of producing wells drilled on Company lands, and leasing additional acreage.    The
Manufacturing segment produces both dimension lumber and MDF. The Company s sawmill operations sold 69.6 million board feet of lumber in the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of 1.6 million board feet, when compared to the
71.2 million board feet sold in the third quarter a year ago. The average lumber sales price in the third quarter of 2016 was $376 per thousand board feet, a $55 per thousand board feet, or 17 percent, increase when compared to the same period
in 2015, as a result of improved demand. MDF sales volume for the third quarter of 2016 was 26 million square feet, which was .5 million square feet more than the 25.5 million square feet sold in the same period of 2015. The average
sales price for MDF sold during the current-year s third quarter was $561 per thousand square feet, an increase of $4 per thousand square feet from the average sales price of $557 per thousand square feet received in the third quarter of 2015.
As with any commodity market, the Company expects the historical volatility of the lumber and MDF markets to continue into the future. Deltic closely monitors market conditions and will adjust production levels to meet market demand as needed.  
 The Real Estate segment reported sales of 25 residential lots during the third quarter of 2016, compared to 34 lots sold in the third quarter
of 2015. The average per-lot sales price was $70,000 in 2016, compared to $62,700 in 2015 s third quarter, due to the mix of lots sold. On October 19, 2016, Deltic offered 45 lots for sale in Chenal Valley and has put all of these lots
under contract to builders. The sale of these lots are scheduled to close before year-end. There were no sales of commercial real estate acreage in the third quarter of 2016 or 2015. The commercial real estate acreage within Chenal Valley continues
to receive interest from potential buyers; however, due to the unpredictable nature of commercial real estate sales activity, the Company cannot predict the timing of closing of any commercial real estate transaction.

    Results of Operations    
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 In the following tables, Deltic s net sales and results of operations are presented for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. Explanations of significant variances and additional analyses for the Company s consolidated and segment operations follow the tables.      
    Consolidated   
 Consolidated net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $1.5 million, an increase of $1.4 million from the third quarter of 2015. The
increase was primarily due to improved financial results for the Manufacturing segment, partially offset by higher Corporate general and administrative and interest expenses.  
 Consolidated cost of sales for the third quarter of 2016 decreased $1.1 million from the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to increased
intercompany eliminations due to the Woodlands segment providing a higher volume of pine sawtimber stumpage to the sawmills, combined with a decrease in the cost of residential lots sold due to fewer lots being sold in the current-year third
quarter.    The main cost drivers affecting the Company s cost of sales and impacting each segment s operating income and thus
consolidated operating income are as follows: Woodlands   direct operating expenses (such as operating salaries and benefits, cull timber removal, and line and road maintenance  
      23  

Table of Contents  

expenses), oil and gas royalty expenses, cost of hauling stumpage to other mills, and cost of timberland sold; Manufacturing   raw materials cost, direct manufacturing expenses (such as
operating salaries and benefits, utilities, insurance, property and business interruption insurance deductibles, and repairs and maintenance), and freight expense; and Real Estate   cost of residential lots, commercial acreage, and speculative
homes sold and the cost of sales of Chenal Country Club. There is generally little to no margin on either hauling stumpage to other mills in the Woodlands segment or freight activity in the Manufacturing segment, since the net sales recorded for
these activities are essentially offset by the cost of hauling stumpage to other mills or freight expense.    Consolidated operating income
increased $2.4 million from the third quarter of 2015. The Woodlands segment s operating income decreased $.4 million, primarily due to a lower average per-ton sales price for pine pulpwood combined with a decrease in oil and gas royalty
revenue, partially offset by an increase in revenue from pine sawtimber harvested. The Manufacturing segment s operating income increased $3.7 million from the third quarter of 2015. This increase was due mainly to a higher average sales price
for lumber, combined with a lower average per-unit cost of MDF sold. The Real Estate segment s operating loss for the third quarter was $.2 million in both 2016 and 2015. Corporate expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $1.7 million higher
when compared to the corresponding quarter of 2015 due to increased general and administrative expense, related to incentive plan costs and professional fees.  
  Woodlands     Selected
financial and statistical data for the Woodlands segment is shown in the following table.      
 
      24  

Table of Contents  

Net sales for the Woodlands segment in the third quarter of 2016 increased $.1 million when compared to the
third quarter of 2015. Pine sawtimber sales were $.4 million higher in 2016 s third quarter due to a five percent increase in harvest volume, combined with a four percent increase in the per-ton average sales price. Pine pulpwood sales
increased $.1 million, as a 41 percent increase in harvest volume was partially offset by a 22 percent lower per-ton average sales price. Oil and gas royalties in the third quarter of 2016 decreased $.3 million due to lower prices for natural gas
combined with lower volumes of gas production caused by the aging of existing wells and to there being no new drilling activity in the third quarter 2016 when compared to the same period of 2015.  
 Cost of sales for the Woodlands segment in the third quarter of 2016 increased $.1 million when compared to the same period a year ago, due to
a higher cost of hauling stumpage to other mills. Operating income for the Woodlands segment was $.4 million less than in the 2015 third quarter due to the same factors affecting net sales and cost of sales and to a higher cost of fee timber
harvested.     Manufacturing   
 Selected financial and statistical data for the Manufacturing segment is shown in the following table.

1   
 Residual by-products are reported net of intercompany eliminations.      Net sales for the
Manufacturing segment in the third quarter of 2016 increased $4.4 million, or 10 percent, when compared to the third quarter of 2015. The average lumber sales price increased $55 per MBF, or 17 percent, from 2015 s third quarter, partially
offset by a 1.6 million board feet decrease in volume sold when compared to the third quarter of 2015. MDF sales volume in the third quarter of 2016 was 26 million square feet, 2 percent more than the same period a year ago, and the
average sales price for MDF was $4 per MSF higher than in the third quarter of 2015.    Cost of sales for the Manufacturing segment was $.6
million higher in the third quarter of 2016 than in the third quarter of 2015, due to an increase in production volume of both lumber and MDF. For the reported cost of sales for sawmill and MDF operations, intersegment eliminations of residual sales
by sawmill operations to MDF operations are not reflected. Elimination costs decreased $.3 million period-over-period. The cost of sales for sawmill operations in the third quarter of 2016 were $.9 million more than in the prior-year third quarter
due to a $.5 million increase in cost of raw material used and to a $.6 million increase in direct manufacturing expense, partially offset by a $.1 million lower freight expense and a $.5 million beneficial inventory variance. Cost of sales for MDF
operations were $.7 million lower than in the third quarter of 2015, as operating performance improved, with less unscheduled downtime and related unplanned maintenance expense. Raw material costs for the current-year quarter were lower by $1.7
million, and direct manufacturing expenses were $.5 million lower as a result of improved operating performance. These were offset by a $1.3 million increase in inventory variance and $.2 million of additional freight expense when compared to the
third quarter of 2015. Operating income for the Manufacturing segment was $3.7 million more than in the 2015 period, due to the same items affecting net sales and cost of sales.  
  Real Estate     Selected
financial and statistical data for the Real Estate segment is shown in the following table.      
 
      26  

Table of Contents  

Net sales for the Real Estate segment in the third quarter of 2016 decreased $.6 million when compared to the
third quarter of 2015. The decreased net sales were due to a reduction in the number of residential lots sold, partially offset by a higher average per-lot sales price. The average sales price per lot sold increased $7,300 per lot sold due to the
mix of lots sold.    Cost of sales for the Real Estate segment was $.6 million lower due to the decrease in the number of residential lots
sold in the current-year quarter. The operating loss for the Real Estate segment was $.2 million in the third quarter of both 2016 and 2015.  
  Corporate     Corporate
operating expense increased $1.7 million during the third quarter of 2016 primarily due to increased incentive plan expense of $1.1 million, combined with a $.5 million increase in professional fees.  
  Eliminations   
 Intersegment sales of timber from Deltic s Woodlands to the Manufacturing segment during the third quarter of 2016 increased $.5 million,
to $5.3 million, when compared to the same quarter of last year. The increase was due to a larger harvest volume from the Woodlands segment s fee timberlands that were transferred to the sawmills. Current period transfer prices are
approximately that of market.     Interest Expense   
 Interest expense was $.3 million higher when compared to the prior-year third quarter, due to increased borrowings as a result of increased
expenditures for purchases of treasury stock and investments in capital projects, combined with the impact of a higher weighted-average interest rate on debt outstanding.  
  Income Taxes     The
effective income tax rate was 38 percent for the third quarter of 2016 and 66 percent for the third quarter of 2015, due to a reduced capital gains tax rate applied to sales of timber in 2016. In addition, the prior-year period included the impact
of a true-up of accrued 2014 taxes to actual tax liabilities for that year per the Company s filed tax returns which had a greater percentage impact due to the lower pretax income amount for the prior-year period.

   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 In the following tables, Deltic s net sales and results of operations are presented for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. Explanations of significant variances and additional analyses for the Company s consolidated and segment operations follow the tables.      

On March 10, 2015 the MDF plant incurred a fire that curtailed operations for the remainder of the quarter. (For additional information refer to Note14   Business Interruption Claim and Gain on Involuntary
Conversion of Assets.)       Consolidated   
 Consolidated net income for the first nine months of 2016 increased $3.3 million when compared to the first nine months of 2015. The increase
was primarily due to improved operating income by the Manufacturing and Real Estate segments, partially offset by decreased operating income for the Woodlands segment combined with increased Corporate expense.  
 Consolidated cost of sales increased $6 million when compared to the first nine months of 2015, primarily due to increased lumber and MDF
production volume in the Manufacturing segment, as a result of improved market conditions; to a higher cost of sales for the Real Estate segment due to the cost of sales associated with a commercial real estate acreage sale; and to selling more
residential lots; partially offset by an increase in intercompany eliminations caused by the Woodlands providing a higher volume of pine stumpage to the Company s sawmills.  
      28  

Table of Contents  

  The main cost drivers affecting the Company s cost of sales and impacting each
segment s operating income and thus consolidated operating income are as follows: Woodlands   direct operating expenses (operating salaries and benefits, cull timber removal, line and road maintenance expenses, etc.), oil and gas royalty
expenses, cost of hauling stumpage to other mills, and cost of timberland sold; Manufacturing   raw materials cost, direct manufacturing expenses (operating salaries and benefits, utilities, insurance, property and business interruption
insurance deductibles, repairs and maintenance, etc.), and freight expense; and Real Estate   cost of residential lots, commercial acreage, and speculative homes sold and the cost of sales of Chenal Country Club. There is generally little to no
margin on either hauling stumpage to other mills in the Woodlands segment or freight activity in the Manufacturing segment, since the net sales recorded for these activities are essentially offset by the cost of hauling stumpage to other mills or
freight expense.    Consolidated operating income for the first nine months of 2016 increased $6.5 million from the first nine months of
2015. The Woodlands segment s operating income decreased $2.1 million, due to decreased oil and gas royalty income and to an increased cost of fee timber harvested, partially offset by increased sales of pine sawtimber and pulpwood. The
Manufacturing segment s operating income for the first nine months of 2016 increased $7 million from the prior-year period, due to an increased sales volume for both lumber and MDF and to a lower average per-unit manufacturing cost for MDF. The
Real Estate segment s operating income increased $2.3 million, mainly due to the sale of a commercial real estate site and increased residential lot sales in the first nine months of 2016. Corporate operating expense was $1.4 million
higher due to an increase in general and administrative expense.     Woodlands   
 Selected financial and statistical data for the Woodlands segment is shown in the following table.  

29  

Table of Contents  

In the Woodlands segment, net sales for the first nine months of 2016 decreased $.8 million from the same
period of 2015. Net sales of pine sawtimber increased $.4 million, due to an increase in average sales price, partially offset by a decrease in harvest volume. Additionally, pine pulpwood sales increased $.3 million, due to a 29 percent increase in
harvest volume, partially offset by a 10 percent lower per-ton average sales price. Hardwood pulpwood sales decreased $.2 million, due to a 36 percent decrease in sales price. Revenues from oil and gas lease rentals decreased $.3 million, as the
amortization period ended for the previously received lease payments for which the original lease period expired and the leasehold became held by production. Oil and gas royalties were $1.3 million less than in the same period of 2015, due to a
decrease in natural gas prices received for the Company s royalty share of gas production, to a decrease in production volume caused by the aging of existing wells, and to there being no new drilling activity. Revenues for hauling stumpage to
other mills was $.3 million more in 2016 s third quarter when compared to the same period of 2015.    Cost of sales for the Woodlands
segment for the first nine months of 2016 increased $.4 million compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was due to a $.2 million increase in direct operating expenses and a $.3 million increase of the cost of hauling stumpage to other
mills. The Woodlands segment s operating income was $2.1 million lower than in the first nine months of 2015, due to the same factors affecting net sales and cost of sales along with a $.7 million increase in the cost of fee timber harvested.
    Manufacturing

   During March 2015, the Company experienced a fire in the press area at its MDF plant in El Dorado that affected the operating results. (For additional information,
see Note 14   Business Interruption Claim and Gain on Involuntary Conversion of Assets)      Net sales for the
Manufacturing segment increased $14.9 million from the prior-year period, primarily due to the benefit of improved wood products markets, which led to a higher average lumber sales price and increased sales volumes for both lumber and MDF. Sales of
lumber increased $10 million, when compared to the first nine months of 2015, primarily due to a higher average lumber sales price combined with an increase in the lumber sales volume. MDF sales increased $3.4 million, due to an increase in MDF
sales volume, partially offset by a lower average MDF sales price.    Cost of sales for the Manufacturing segment in the first nine months
of 2016 increased $6.7 million from the first nine months of 2015. For the reported cost of sales for sawmill and MDF operations, intersegment eliminations of residual sales by sawmill operations to MDF operations are not reflected. Elimination
costs increased $.9 million period-over-period. The cost of sales for sawmill operations in the first nine months of 2016 were $6.9 million more than the prior-year first nine months, due to an increase in raw material costs of $3.6 million combined
with a $1.3 million increase in direct operating expenses. Cost of sales for MDF operations in 2016 s first nine months were $.2 million lower than in the first nine months of 2015 due to decreased raw material costs and reduced unplanned
maintenance expense. Operating income for the Manufacturing segment was $7 million more than in the same period a year ago, due to the same items affecting net sales and cost of sales.

   Real Estate   
 Selected financial and statistical data for the Real Estate segment is shown in the following table.  
   
   Net sales for the Real Estate segment in the first nine months of 2016 increased $3 million when compared to
the first nine months of 2015, primarily due to increased residential lots sold, to a higher average per-lot sales price, and to a sale of commercial real estate acreage. The average sales price per lot for the first nine months of 2016 increased
$16,000 from the same period of 2015, due to the mix of lots sold.    Cost of sales for the Real Estate segment increased $.7 million
compared to the first nine months of 2015, due to sales of increased residential lots and to a sale of commercial real estate acreage. The increase in operating income for the Real Estate segment from the first nine months of 2015 was due to the
additional residential lots sold and the income from the commercial real estate acreage sale.     Corporate   
 The Corporate operating expense was $1.4 million higher than in the first nine months of 2015, mainly due to increased general and
administrative expense, primarily incentive plan costs.     Eliminations   
 Intersegment sales of timber from Deltic s Woodlands to the Manufacturing segment increased $.4 million to $16.9 million for the first
nine months of 2016. The increase was mainly due to a small change in volume of the timber transferred to the sawmills. Logs supplied by the Woodlands segment to Company sawmills are transferred at prices that approximate market.  
      32  

Table of Contents  

   Interest Expense   
 Interest expense for the first nine months of 2016 increased $1.9 million when compared to the same period of 2015, due to borrowings for
capital projects and share repurchases, combined with the impact of a higher weighted-average interest rate on the debt outstanding. A patronage refund of $.3 million received from one of the Company s lenders in the second quarter of 2016 was
accounted for as a reduction of interest expense.     Income Taxes   
 The effective income tax rate was 33 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 37 percent for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The current-year income tax rate is lower due to a beneficial capital gains tax rate applied to gains from timber harvesting activity for 2016.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources      Cash
Flows and Capital Expenditures     Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $28.3 million for the first nine months of 2016,
compared to $23.6 million for the same period of 2015. Cash from operations and borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility provided the cash needed for capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, timberland acquisition
expenditures, and payment of dividends. Changes in operating working capital, other than cash and cash equivalents, provided cash of $1 million in the first nine months of 2016 and $4.5 million in the same period of 2015. The Company s
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows identifies other differences between net income and cash provided by operating activities for each reporting period.  
 Capital expenditures required cash of $32.4 million in the current-year period and $24.4 million a year ago. Capital expenditures by segment
consisted of the following:      
   Timberland acquisition expenditures, including timberland acquired in exchanges, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $1.2 million and $.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The net change in purchased stumpage inventory to be utilized in the Company s sawmilling operations required cash of $1.3 million and
$.7 million in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2015 the Company received $1.6 million in proceeds from an involuntary conversion of assets, while there was no such revenue in 2016. The Company borrowed $26 million and repaid
$8 million in the first nine months of 2016, while it borrowed $115 million and repaid $108 million in the first nine months of 2015. Dividends of $3.6 million were paid in the first nine months of 2016, while $3.8 million in dividends were
paid in the first nine months of 2015. Proceeds from exercises of stock options and the related tax benefits were $1.6 million in the first nine months of 2016 and $.8 million in the first nine months of 2015. The Company utilized $15.2 million to
repurchase stock in the first nine months

of 2016, with $9.6 million of share repurchases in the same period of 2015. Other financing activities required cash of $1 million in the first nine months of 2016 and $.7 million for the same
period of the prior year.     Financial Condition   
 Adjusted working capital, defined by the Company as the net of current assets and current liabilities excluding current maturities of long-term
debt, totaled $7.2 million at September 30, 2016, and $12.2 million at December 31, 2015. Deltic s adjusted working capital ratio at September 30, 2016 was 1.30 to 1, compared to 1.66 to 1 at the end of 2015. Cash and cash
equivalents at the end of the third quarter of 2016 were $3 million, a decrease of $2.4 million from the December 31, 2015 balance of $5.4 million. The total indebtedness of the Company at September 30, 2016 was $242 million, including
current maturities of long-term debt of $40 million, compared to total indebtedness at December 31, 2015 of $224 million. Deltic s total debt to stockholders  equity ratio was .99 to 1 at September 30, 2016 and .881 to 1 at
December 31, 2015.     Liquidity   
 The primary sources of the Company s liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing, and working capital. The
Company s current strategy for growth continues to emphasize its timberland acquisition program, in addition to expanding lumber production as market conditions allow and developing residential and/or commercial properties at Chenal Valley,
Wildwood Place, and Red Oak Ridge.    To facilitate these growth plans, the Company has an agreement with a group of banks, which provides
an unsecured and committed revolving credit facility totaling $430 million, and includes an option to request an increase in the amount of aggregate revolving commitments by $50 million. On July 29, 2016 the Company utilized a portion of the
$50 million letter of credit component available under its revolving credit facility to replace the letter of credit that supports the Union County, Arkansas Taxable Industrial Revenue Bonds that total $29 million and was scheduled to expire on
August 31, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, there was $103 million outstanding in combined borrowings and letters of credit against the credit facility, leaving $327 million available. The credit agreement contains restrictive covenants,
including limitations on the incurrence of debt and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios. (For additional information about the Company s current financing arrangements, refer to Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial
statements included in the Company s 2015 annual report on Form 10-K and see Note 8 of this third quarter report on Form 10-Q.)    The
table below sets forth the covenants in the credit facility and senior notes payable and status with respect to these covenants as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

 The leverage ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total capital. Total debt includes indebtedness for borrowed money, secured liabilities, obligations in respect of letters of credit, and guarantees. Total
capital is the sum of total debt and net worth. Net worth is calculated as total assets minus total liabilities, as reflected on the balance sheet. This covenant is applied at the end of each quarter.    
      34

 Timber market value must be greater than 175 percent of total debt (as defined in (1) above.) The timber market value is calculated by multiplying the average price received for sales of timber for the preceding
four quarters by the current quarter s ending inventory of timber. This covenant is applied at the end of the quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis.    
 Based on management s current operating projections, the Company believes it will remain in compliance with the debt covenants and have
sufficient liquidity to finance operations and pay all obligations. However, depending on market conditions and the possibility of the return of economic deterioration, the Company could request amendments, or waivers for the covenants, or obtain
refinancing in future periods. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain amendments or waivers, or negotiate agreeable refinancing terms should it become needed.  
 In December 2000, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $10 million of Deltic common stock. The
Company s Board of Directors expanded the program by $25 million in December 2007, by $25 million in December 2014, and by $20 million in February 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had expended $55 million under this program,
with the purchase of 1,066,745 shares at an average cost of $51.59 per share; inclusive of 277,430 shares purchased in 2016 at an average cost of $54.65 per share. In its two previous repurchase programs, Deltic purchased 479,601 shares at an
average cost of $20.89 per share and 419,542 shares at a $24.68 per share average cost, respectively.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,
Contractual Obligations, and Commitments     The Company has both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans
that cover the majority of its employees. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary. Deltic also has other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all of its employees. The health care plan is
contributory with participants  contributions adjusted as needed; the life insurance plan is noncontributory. With regard to all of the Company s employee and retiree benefit plans, Deltic is unaware of any trends, demands, commitments,
events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the Company s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. (For information about material assumptions underlying the accounting for these plans
and other components of the plans, refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s 2015 annual report on Form 10-K.)  
 Tabular summaries of the Company s contractual cash payment obligations and other commercial commitment expirations, by period, are
presented in the following tables.

 Interest commitments are estimated using the Company s current interest rates for the respective debt agreements over their remaining terms to expiration.    
  Outlook     Deltic s
management believes that cash provided from its operations and the remaining amount available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its expected cash needs and planned expenditures, including those of the Company s continued
timberland acquisition, real estate development, and stock repurchase programs, and capital expenditures, for the foreseeable future.     Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates     Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and
uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in these financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The
Company has disclosed its critical accounting policies in its 2015 annual report on Form 10-K, and this disclosure should be read in conjunction with this Form 10-Q.  
  Impact of Recently Effective Accounting Pronouncements   
 (For information regarding the impact of recently effective accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements.)     Outlook     Pine sawtimber
harvest levels are expected to be 135,000 to 165,000 tons in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 733,000 to 763,000 tons for the year. Finished lumber sales volumes are estimated at 65 to 75 million board feet for the fourth quarter and 276 to
286 million board feet for the year. MDF sales volumes for the fourth quarter and year of 2016 are estimated to be 20 to 30 million square feet and 100 to 110 million square feet, respectively. Actual lumber and MDF sales volumes are
subject to market conditions. Residential lot sales are projected to be 50 to 70 lots and 103 to 123 lots for the fourth quarter and the year, respectively. Even though commercial acreage in Chenal Valley has received interest from potential buyers,
it is difficult to anticipate future closings due to the volatile nature of commercial real estate transactions and the significant number of factors related to any sale. The Corporate segment will record a one-time, pretax expense of approximately
$3 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. This expense is related to the retirement of the Company s former President and CEO and is inclusive of a cash payment made upon his retirement and the financial impact of the vesting of equity
grants previously awarded to him.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     The Company s market risk has not changed
significantly from that set forth under the caption  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  in Item 7A of Part II of its 2015 annual report on Form 10-K. Those disclosures should be read in conjunction with this
Form 10-Q.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
 Deltic Timber Corporation (the  Company  or  Deltic ) has established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the Company s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors.  
 Based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2016, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company have concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and this information was accumulated and communicated to the Company s
Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  
   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
 Deltic s management, with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated any changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter, and have concluded that there was no change to Deltic s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is
reasonably likely to materially affect Deltic s internal control over financial reporting.
