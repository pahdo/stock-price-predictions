NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited)

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. Realization values August be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

While the information presented in the accompanying six months to August 31, 2016 financial statements is unaudited, it includes all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial position have been included and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. It is suggested that these interim unaudited financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended February 29, 2016.

Reclassification

Certain amounts reported in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to the current period presentation.

Recently Adopted and Recently Enacted Accounting Pronouncements

In September, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805) ( ASU 2015-16 ). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-016 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14 ). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period.

In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) ( ASU 2015-03 ), which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2015-03 on its balance sheets.

On November 2014, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-16 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). The amendments in this Update do not change the current criteria in GAAP for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is, an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract, among other relevant criteria. The amendments clarify how current GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. The effects of initially adopting the amendments in this Update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. Retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior periods.

On November 2014, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-17 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).  The amendments in this Update provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18, 2014. After the effective date, an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However, if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued, the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle.

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN

At August 31, 2016, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, had an accumulated deficit of $22,389,867 (February 29, 2016 - $21,650,457) since its inception and incurred a net loss of $723,614 (2015 - $224,438) for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which casts substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers obtaining additional funds by equity financing and/or from related party. Management expects the Company s cash requirement over the twelve-month period ended February 28, 2017 to be $300,000. While the Company is expending its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds for operations.

NOTE 3   PREPAID EXPENSES

As of August 31, 2016, included in prepaid expenses is $36,266 (February 29, 2016: $12,970) for an insurance premium for the directors of the Company financed through Flatiron Capital.  Insurance policy is from August 23, 2016 to August 23, 2017.

NOTE 4   ACCRUED EXPENSES/ACCRUED EXPENSES   RELATED PARTY

Other liabilities and accrued expenses consisted of the following:

As of August 31, 2016, included in the trade payables is $33,495 (February 29, 2016: $33,495) and $2,389 (February 29, 2016: $2,389) owing to directors of the Company, an accounting firm in which a director of the Company is a partner and a company controlled by the Company s President and a director with respect to unpaid fees, purchases and expenses, $480,000 (February 29, 2016: $480,000) owing to stockholders of the Company in respect of royalties payable and $53,694 (February 29, 2016: $53,694) owing to the former president of the Company in respect of unpaid wages.

At August 31, 2016, advances payable of $203,543 (February 29, 2016: $60,158) are due to a company controlled by a director of the Company.  

The accounts payable and advances payable are unsecured, non-interest bearing and have no specific terms of repayment. Sense Technologies, Inc. plans to use the funds from sales, and if we are able to raise funds through equity issuances, to fund the payment of delinquent liabilities.

NOTE 5   ROYALTIES PAYABLE

Pursuant to the licenses with ScopeOut  license called for $150,000 to be paid over two years (paid) along with a royalty of 10% of wholesale price for each ScopeOut  unit sold, but not less than $2.00 per unit. In order to maintain the exclusive license for the ScopeOut  products, in accordance with the license agreement with Palowmar Industries, LLC, we are required to pay royalties to the licensor based on the following minimum quantities of units sold:

During 2010, the Company re-negotiated the exclusive license agreement with the Scope Out  inventor. All prior minimum royalties were eliminated, and accordingly, the Company recorded $602,907 additional capital for a related party write-off.

Prepaid royalties payable under the new license are $5,000 per month for twelve months commencing September 1, 2010. The new agreement also calls for a 5% royalty with a $.75 per unit maximum  minimum royalty  to retain exclusivity with the following volumes:

End of calendar year containing the second anniversary:

30,000 units

End of calendar year containing the third anniversary:   

60,000 units

End of calendar year containing the fourth anniversary:

110,000 units

End of calendar year containing the fifth anniversary and thereafter: 

125,000 units

No royalties are currently accrued as we have not yet reached the end of the calendar year containing the second anniversary.

Such  calendar year  commencing the minimum royalties to retain exclusivity is the first year within which an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and/or Tier 1 manufacturer sub-licenses the Scope Out  product.

For any sub-licenses of the product, royalties are shared as follows:

OEM/Tier 1 Supplier Sub Licensor:

65% Sense Technologies

35% Inventor

Any other Sub-Licensor:

50% Sense Technologies

50% Inventor

The current royalties accrued for Scope Out royalties are $nil as of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016.

Pursuant to the Guardian Alert licenses, we are required to make royalty payments to the licensors and meet sales targets as follows:

a) 
 
 $6.00(US) per unit on the first one million units sold;

b) 
 
 thereafter, the greater of $4.00(US) per unit sold or 6% of the wholesale selling price on units sold; and

c) 
 
 50% of any fees paid to Sense in consideration for tooling, redesign, technical or aesthetic development or, should the licensors receive a similar fee, the licensors will pay 50% to Sense.

In order to retain the exclusive right to this license we incurred minimum royalty fees. Because we were unable to pay these fees, we accrued the royalties as a payable. Royalties accruals were ceased in 2004 and rights of exclusivity were forfeited. Royalties payable to Guardian Alert are $480,000 and $480,000 as of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, respectively.

This balance is presented as Common Stock Payable as of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016.

During the six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company issued 475,000 common shares for consulting services and 56,000 common shares for interest expense.

d)            Options  

Stock-based Compensation Plan

The Company has adopted a Stock Option Plan ( the plan ) in which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors makes a determination to whom options should be granted and at what price and their terms of vesting.

The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted. For employees, the compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period which approximates the vesting period. Compensation expense for stock options granted to non-employees is amortized over the contract services period or, if none exists, from the date of grant until the options vest. Compensation associated with unvested options granted to non-employees is re-measured on each balance sheet date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The expected volatility of options granted has been determined using the historical stock price. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise, forfeiture and employee termination within the valuation model. For non-employees, the expected term of the options approximates the full term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero. Based on the best estimate, management applied the estimated forfeiture rate of Nil in determining the expense recorded in the accompanying Statement of Loss.

The Company has granted directors common share purchase options. These options were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company s stock on the date of the grant.

Sense Technologies Inc. Form 10-Q

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the period ended August 31, 2016 and our Financial Statements and notes thereto for the period ended August 31, 2015.

1.           Overview of Operations

Sense holds a non-exclusive license to manufacture, distribute, market and sublicense world-wide, a patented technology which is used to produce the Guardian Alert  backing awareness system for motor vehicles utilizing microwave radar technology.  The Company assembles the product in Charlotte, NC.  The company also holds a non-exclusive license to manufacture, distribute, market and sublicense world-wide, the ScopeOut  product, a patented system of specially-designed mirrors which are placed at specific points on vehicles to offer drivers a more complete view of the blind spots toward the rear of the vehicle.  This product is manufactured in China through an outsourced vendor.

2.           Results of Operations

For the three and six month period ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the three and six month period ended August 31, 2015.

Sales for the six months ended August 31, 2016 decreased by 52% from $118,488 to $57,000 due to decreased demand for Guardian Alert. Revenue is recognized by management only upon receipt of an actual purchase order from a customer, and the related invoicing to the company or, in the absence of a purchase order (i.e., verbal order), the actual invoicing to the customer, when the products are shipped and collection is reasonably assured.

Sales for the three months ended August 31, 2016 decreased by 88% from 61,500 to 7,500 due to decreased demand from key customers.

We continued to market both products.  While it is the company objective to grow sales, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in this manner and sustain comparable sales in future periods.

Consulting fees increased from $40,800 for the three month period ended August 31, 2015 to $237,555 for the three month period ended August 31, 2016. The increase was a result of consulting related to Guardian Alert product sales.

The Company determined that prior expenses for marketing and advertising costs related to the sales plan for ScopeOut  were not producing results. Management believed it was in the best interest of the company to discontinue these costs. The Company is concentrating on Guardian Alert  sales based on market interest, and in doing so as cost-efficiently as possible, the Company has replaced those costs with a  little-to-no cost  effort of asking existing fleet-customers to refer the Guardian Alert  products to other fleets.  Additionally, the company is paying more in commissions, as previously stated, because of the efforts to incentivize the sales of the Guardian Alert  to fleets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our cash position at August 31, 2016 was $nil as compared to $1,298 at February 29, 2016. This was due to our use of cash in operating and investing activities and cash provided by financing activities as described below.

We have a working capital deficit of $5,625,817 and $5,112,981 as of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, respectively. If we are unable to raise adequate working capital for fiscal 2017, we will be restricted in the implementation of our business plan.  If this were to happen, the value of our securities would diminish and we may be forced to change our business plan for fiscal 2017, which would result in the value of our securities declining in value and/or becoming worthless.  If we raise an adequate amount of working capital to implement our business plan, we anticipate incurring significant expenses relating to paying down our notes payable and royalties that are in arrears. Additionally we will incur net losses until a sufficient client base can be established, of which there can be no assurance.

Net cash used in operating activities

Net cash used in operating activities was $133,211 in 2016, compared to $207,207 in 2015. The decrease in cash used in 2016 was largely due to the increase in advances payable and accrued expenses.

Net cash used in investing activities

Net cash used for investing activities was $153,205 in 2016, compared to $nil in 2015.  The increase was due to the costs associated with the acquisition of Soy Meals.

Net cash provided by financing activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $285,368 in 2016 compared to net cash provided of $207,207 in 2015.

During the six months ended August 31, 2016, we received $190,000 through subscriptions to our common shares compared to $40,000 during the six months ended August 31, 2015.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its chief executive officer (who is also acting in the capacity as the principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The Company, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. To address the material weaknesses, the Company performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort to ensure its consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, the Company believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.

The Company s internal conclusion related to its disclosure and procedural controls is due to the number and magnitude or changes to its draft 10Q recommended by the Company s independent auditor.

The Company plans to continue working with competent outside professionals to help it with quarterly reporting and if its business plan is successful additional improvements in the Company s accounting department will be made.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In addition, the Company with the participation of its chief executive officers have determined that no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during or subsequent to the quarter ended August 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is (as that term is defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
