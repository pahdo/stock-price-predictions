1. Summary of Signific    ant   Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report are unaudited. In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods of the fiscal year ending January 28, 2017 and of the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016. Certain items included in these statements are based on management s estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the year. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Foot Locker, Inc. s (the  Company ) Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2016, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 24, 2016. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the   Financial Accounting Standards Board   (   FASB ) issued   Accounting Standards Update   (   ASU )     2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The core principle of this amendment is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU     2014-09, as amended by ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods herein. Earlier application is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. These ASUs can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or   as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption  .   The Company is evaluating the effects of the adoption of these ASUs on its consolidated financial statements, however we currently do not expect the adoption will significantly affect our consolidated financial statements  , however   some changes   are   expected regarding the timing of recognizing gift card breakage.  

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17  , Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  . ASU 2015-17 requires all deferred tax liabilities and assets to be presented in the balance sheet as noncurrent. The Company adopted this standard on a prospective basis as of th  e quarter ended April 30, 2016 and   reclassified deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities classified as current to noncurrent. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted. 

In February 2016, the   FASB   issued   ASU   2016-02,   Leases  . This ASU   requir  es   lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases, as well as additional disclosure regarding leasing arrangements. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods   therein  , and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with earlier adoption permitted.   The Company does not expect to early adopt this ASU and is currently evaluating the effect of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. The Company has historically presented a non-GAAP measure to adjust its balance sheet to present operating leases as   if they were   capital leases. Based upon that analysis and preliminary evaluation of the new standard, we currently estimate the adoption will result in   the addition of   $3 to $4 billion of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  ,   with no   significant   change to our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   ASU 2016-09 simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including tax consequences, forfeitures, and classifications   of the tax related items   in the statement of cash flows.   ASU   2016-09 is effective for annual reporting beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. The manner of adoption varies, with certain provisions applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective approach, with others applied prospectively. The Company has evaluated the effects of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and expects the change relating to excess tax benefits will introduce significant volatility to income tax expense as   the recognition of the excess tax benefits are   dependent on exercise patterns which are inherently unpredictable. The other components of this ASU are not expected to   have a   significant   effect     on   our consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740):     Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  . ASU 2016-16 requires recognition of income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods after December     15,     2017, including interim periods   therein  , with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.   The Company does not expect to adopt this ASU   until required   and   is currently evaluating the effects of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash.   ASU 2016-18 require  s   that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods after December 15, 2017 including interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

Other recently issued accounting pronouncements did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material effect on the Company s present or future consolidated financial statements.  

2  . Segment Information 

The Company has determined that its reportable segments are those that are based on its method of internal reporting. The Company has   two   reportable segments, Athletic Stores and Direct-to-Customers. The Company evaluates performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is division results. Division profit reflects income before income taxes,   pension litigation charge,   corporate expense, non-operating income, and net interest expense.  

(1)  

Included in the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 is a   $6   million   pre-tax   non-cash impairment charge to write-down long-lived store assets of Runners Point and Sidestep. See Note 3,   Impairment and   Litigation Charges   for additional information.    

(2)  

Included in the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 is a pre-tax litigation charge of   $100   million relating to a pension litigation matter described further in Note 13,   Legal Proceedings  .  

(3)  

Other income includes non-operating items, such as lease termination gains, royalty income, insurance recoveries, and the changes in fair value, premiums paid, and realized gains associated with foreign currency option contracts.

3.   Impairment   and Litigation   Charges 

Due to the continued underperformance of our Runners Point and Sidestep stores, management determined during the third quarter of 2016 that a triggering event had occurred and, therefore, an impairment review was conducted. This evaluation resulted in a non-cash charge of   $6   million to write-down store fixtures and leasehold improvements of 116 stores. The Company quantified the amount of the impairment by estimating the fair value of the assets reviewed by determining the cash flows expected   from   the use of the assets. If the carrying value of the assets exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge was recorded representing the difference between the discounted future cash flow, using the Company s weighted-average cost of capital, and the carrying value. The Company also performed an impairment review of other intangible assets related to Runners Point and Sidestep. The Company calculated the fair value using a relief from royalty concept and compared the fair value to the carrying value to determine if the asset was impaired. As a result of this review, no impairment charge   of these assets   was required. 

During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a   $100   million pension litigation charge. Please see Note 13,   Legal Proceedings   for further information. 

4. Goodwill 

Annually during the first quarter, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, the Company reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment. The annual review of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives performed during the first quarter of 2016 did not result in the recognition of impairment. The following table provides a summary of goodwill by reportable segment.  

5. Other Intangible Assets, net 

The components of finite-lived intangible assets and intangible assets not subject to amortization are as follows:  

(1)  

The change in the ending balances also reflects the effect of foreign currency fluctuations due primarily to the movements of the euro in relation to the U.S. dollar.

7  . Revolving Credit Facility 

On   May 19, 2016  , the Company entered into a new credit agreement with its banks ( 2016 Credit Agreement ) that replaced the Company s prior credit agreement ( 2011 Restated Credit Agreement ). The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a   $400   million asset-based revolving credit facility maturing on   May 19, 2021  .    D  uring the term of the 2016 Credit Agreement, the Company may   also   increase the commitments by up to   $200   million, subject to customary conditions. Interest is determined, at the Company s option, by the federal funds rate plus a margin of   0.125   percent to   0.375   percent, or a Eurodollar rate, determined by reference to LIBOR, plus a margin of   1.125   percent to   1.375   percent depending on availability under the 2016 Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company will pay a commitment fee of   0.20   percent per annum on the unused portion of the commitments. 

The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a security interest in certain of the Company s domestic   store   assets, including inventory assets, accounts receivable, cash deposits, and certain insurance proceeds.   The Company is not required to comply with any financial covenants unless certain events of default have occurred and are continuing, or if availability under the 2016 Credit Agreement does not exceed the greater of $40 million and 10 percent of the Loan Cap (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement). There are no restrictions relating to the payment of dividends and share repurchases, as long as no default or event of default has occurred and the aggregate principal amount of unused commitments under the 2016 Credit Agreement is not less than 15 percent of the lesser of the aggregate amount of the commitments and the Borrowing Base, determined as of the   preceding   fiscal month and on a proforma basis for the following six fiscal months.    

The Company uses the credit facility to support standby letters of credit in connection with insurance programs  .     T  he amount outstanding as of October 29, 2016 was not significant. The Company s management does not currently expect to borrow under the facility in 2016. The Company paid approximately   $2   million in fees relating to the new credit facility. Deferred financing fees are amortized over the life of the facility on a straight-line basis, which is comparable to the interest method. The unamortized balance   as of   October 29, 2016   was   $2   million  . Interest expense including facility fees, related to the revolving credit facility   was   $1   million for the   thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015.   

8. Financial Instruments 

The Company operates internationally and utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to mitigate its foreign currency exposures, primarily related to third-party and intercompany forecasted transactions. As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate this counterparty credit risk, the Company has a   practice   of entering into contracts only with major financial institutions selected based upon their credit ratings and other financial factors. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties throughout the duration of the derivative instrument. Additional information is contained within Note 9,   Fair Value Measurements  . 

Derivative Holdings Designated as Hedges 

For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period, the Company formally documents the nature of the hedged items and the relationships between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and the methods of assessing hedge effectiveness and ineffectiveness. In addition, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of a forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction would occur. If it were deemed probable that the forecasted transaction would not occur, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument would be recognized in earnings immediately. No such gains or losses were recognized in earnings for any of the periods presented. Derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period, which management evaluates periodically.

FOOT LOCKER, INC. 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The primary currencies to which the Company is exposed are the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. For the most part, merchandise inventories are purchased by each geographic area in their respective local currency. The most significant exception to this is the United Kingdom, whose merchandise inventory purchases are denominated in euros. For option and foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of the purchase of inventory, the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of AOCL and is recognized as a component of cost of sales when the related inventory is sold. The amount reclassified to cost of sales related to such contracts was not significant for any of the periods presented. The effective portion of gains or losses associated with other forward contracts is deferred as a component of AOCL until the underlying transaction is reported in earnings. The ineffective portion of gains and losses related to cash flow hedges recorded to earnings was also not significant for any of the periods presented. When using a forward contract as a hedging instrument, the Company excludes the time value of the contract from the assessment of effectiveness. At quarter-end,   substantially all   of the Company s hedged forecasted transactions were less than twelve months, and the Company expects all derivative-related amounts reported in AOCL to be reclassified to earnings within twelve months.  

The net change in the fair value of the foreign exchange derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges of the purchase of inventory was a   $1    m  illion   and   $4   million gain for   the thirteen and the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016, and therefore decreased AOCL. At October 29, 2016, there was   a    $6   million   gain included in AOCL  .     For the thirteen weeks and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015, the net change in fair value was a gain of   $2   million and   $1   million, respectively. The notional value of the foreign exchange contracts designed as hedges outstanding at October 29, 2016 was   $105   million, and these contracts mature at various dates through   January 2018  .    

Derivative Holdings Not Designated as Hedges 

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts that are not designated as hedges in order to manage the   costs of foreign-currency denominated merchandise purchases and intercompany transactions. Changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded in earnings immediately within selling, general and administrative expenses. The net change in fair value resulted in income of   $1   million for the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 and was not significant for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016. The   net change in fair value resulted in expense of   $3   million and   $1   million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015, respectively. The   notional value of the foreign exchange contracts not   designed as hedges outstanding at October 29, 2016 was   $12   million, and these contracts mature at various dates through   December 2016  . 

From time to time, t  he   Company mitigates the effect of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on the reporting of foreign-currency denominated earnings by entering into currency option contracts. Changes in the fair value of these foreign currency option contracts, which are not designated as hedges, are recorded in earnings immediately within other income. The realized gains, premiums paid, and changes in the fair market value recorded were not significant for any of the periods presented.   No   such contracts were outstanding at October 29, 2016.   

Additionally, the Company enters into diesel fuel forward and option contracts to mitigate a portion of the Company s freight expense due to the variability caused by fuel surcharges imposed by our third-party freight carriers. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in earnings immediately. The effect was not significant for any of the periods presented.   No   such contracts were outstanding at October 29, 2016.

9. Fair Value Measurements 

The Company s financial assets recorded at fair value are categorized as follows: 

Level 1      

Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  

Level 2    

Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.  

Level 3    

Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable.  

The following tables provide a summary of the Company s recognized assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

Securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in other comprehensive income, unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary.   The fair value of the auction rate security is determined by using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets and accordingly is classified as a Level 2 instrument. 

The Company s derivative financial instruments are valued using market-based inputs to valuation models. These valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, and measures of volatility and, therefore, are classified as Level 2 instruments. 

There were no transfers into or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 assets and liabilities for any of the periods presented.

The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt and obligations under capital leases were as follows: 

The fair value of long-term debt is determined by using model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value drivers are observable in active markets and, therefore, are classified as Level 2. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents and other current receivables and payables approximate their fair value. 

10. Earnings Per Share    

The Company accounts for and discloses earnings per share using the treasury stock method. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Restricted stock awards, which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, are considered participating securities and are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share reflects the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period used in the basic earnings per share computation plus dilutive common stock equivalents.  

The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows: 

Contingently issuable shares of 0.3 million have been excluded from the diluted calculation as the vesting conditions have not been satisfied as of both October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015. These shares relate to RSU awards issued in connection with the Company s long-term incentive program.

11. Pension and Postretirement Plans 

The Company has defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its North American employees, which are funded in accordance with the provisions of the laws where the plans are in effect.   T  he Company   also   has a defined benefit pension plan covering certain employees of the Runners Point Group.  

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company sponsors postretirement medical and life insurance plans, which are available to most of its retired U.S. employees. These medical and life insurance plans are contributory and are not funded. 

The following are the components of net periodic pension benefit cost and net periodic postretirement benefit income, which   are   recognized as part of SG A expense: 

During the first quarter     of 2016, the Company made a contribution of $25 million to th  e U.S. qualified plan   and   contributed   another   $8 million on August 31, 2016. The Company continually evaluates the amount and timing of any future contributions.     The Company currently expects to contribute $4 million to the Canadian qualified plan during the fourth quarter of 2016. Actual contributions are dependent on several factors, including the outcome of the ongoing   U.S.   pension litigation. See Note 13,   Legal Proceedings,   for further information.  

12. Share-Based Compensation 

Total compensation expense included in SG A, and the associated tax benefits recognized related to the Company s share-based compensation plans  ,   were as follows:

Valuation Model and Assumptions 

The Company uses a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based awards. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various and highly subjective assumptions, including expected term and expected volatility. The following table shows the Company s assumptions used to compute the share-based compensation expense for awards granted during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015:    

The information in the following table covers option   activity   under the Company s stock option plans for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016: 

The total fair value of options vested as of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 was   $9   million and   $14   million, respectively. The cash received from option exercises for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 was   $10   million and   $24   million, respectively. The cash received from option exercises for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 was   $25   million and   $63   million, respectively.  

The total intrinsic value of options exercised (the difference between the market price of the Company s common stock on the exercise date and the price paid by the optionee to exercise the option) is presented below:  

The total tax benefit realized from option exercises   was   $7   million and   $17   million for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016, respectively, and was   $12   million and   $37   million for the corresponding prior-year periods.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options outstanding, outstanding and exercisable, and vested and expected to vest (the difference between the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of the period and the exercise price of the options, multiplied by the number of in-the-money stock options) is presented below:  

As of October 29, 2016 there was   $8   million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of   1.4   years.     The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at October 29, 2016: 

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units 

Restricted shares of the Company s common stock and restricted stock units ( RSU ) may be awarded to certain officers, key employees of the Company, and to nonemployee directors. Additionally, RSU awards are made to employees in connection with the Company s long-term incentive program. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company s common stock provided that the performance and vesting conditions are satisfied. There were   678,466   and   588,308   RSU awards outstanding as of October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.  

Generally, awards fully vest after the passage of time, typically three years. However, RSU awards made in connection with the Company s long-term incentive program are earned after the attainment of certain performance metrics and vest after the passage of time.   Restricted stock is considered outstanding at the time of grant and the holders have voting rights. Dividends are paid to holders of restricted stock that vest with the passage of time. With regard to performance-based restricted stock, dividends will be accumulated and paid after the performance criteria are met. No dividends are paid or accumulated on RSU awards.   Compensation expense is recognized using the market value at the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting period, provided the recipient continues to be employed by the Company.

Restricted stock and RSU activity for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 is summarized as follows: 

The total value of awards for which restrictions lapsed during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 was   $8   million and   $10   million, respectively. As of October 29, 2016, there was   $16   million of total unrecognized compensation cost  ,   net of forfeitures  ,   related to nonvested restricted awards. 

13. Legal Proceedings  

Legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries consist of ordinary, routine litigation, including administrative proceedings, incidental to the business of the Company or businesses that have been sold or disposed of by the Company in past years. These legal proceedings include commercial, intellectual property, customer, environmental, and employment-related claims. 

The Company and the Company s U.S. retirement plan are defendants in a class action (  Osberg v. Foot Locker Inc.   et ano., filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York) in which the plaintiff alleges that, in connection with the 1996 conversion of the retirement plan to a defined benefit plan with a cash balance formula, the Company and the retirement plan failed to properly advise plan participants of the  wear-away  effect of the conversion. Plaintiff s claims were for breach of fiduciary duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and violation of the statutory provisions governing the content of the Summary Plan Description. The trial was held in July 2015 and the court issued a decision in September 2015 in favor of the class on the foregoing claims. The court ordered that the Plan be reformed. As a result of this development, the Company determined that it is probable a liability exists. The Company s reasonable estimate of this liability is a range between   $100   million and   $200   million, with no amount within that range more probable than any other amount. Therefore, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company recorded a charge of   $100   million pre-tax ($  61   million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2015. This amount has been classified as a long-term liability.   The Company   has   appeal  ed   the court s decision, and the judgment has been stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.   The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself in this case. In light of the uncertainties involved in this matter, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not differ from the amount currently accrued by the Company.  

Management does not believe that the outcome of any such legal proceedings pending against the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, as described above, would have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, taken as a whole, based upon current knowledge and taking into consideration current accruals. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and judgments could be rendered or settlements entered into that could adversely affect the Company s operating results or cash flows in a particular period.

Item 2.     Management s D  iscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Business Overview 

Foot Locker, Inc., through its subsidiaries, operates in two reportable segments   Athletic Stores and Direct-to-  Customers. The Athletic Stores segment is one of the largest athletic footwear and apparel retailers in the world,   with   formats   that   include Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker,   SIX:02,   Champs Sports, Footaction  , Runners Point, and Sidestep. The Direct-to-Customers segment includes Footlocker.com, Inc. and other affiliates, including Eastbay, Inc., and our international ecommerce businesses, which sell to customers through their Internet and mobile sites, and catalogs. 

The Foot Locker brand is one of the most widely recognized names in the markets in which the Company operates, epitomizing premium quality for the active lifestyle customer. This brand equity has aided the Company s ability to successfully develop and increase its portfolio of complementary retail store formats, such as Lady Foot Locker, and Kids Foot Locker, as well as Footlocker.com, its direct-to-customer business. Through various marketing channels, including broadcast, digital, social, print, and various sports sponsorships and events, the Company reinforces its image with a consistent message       namely, that it is the destination for athletically inspired shoes and apparel with a wide selection of merchandise in a full-service environment.  

Store Count 

At   October 29, 2016  , the Company   operated   3,394   stores   as compared with   3,383   and   3,432   stores at     January     30,     2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively. A total of   71 f  ranchised stores were operati  ng   at   October     29,     2016  , as   compared with   64 stores at both   January 30, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  . Revenue from the franchised stores was not significant for   any of the periods presented  . These stores are not included in the Company s operating store count above  . 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 

The   Company   present  s   certain non-GAAP measures  , such as sales changes excluding foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted net income before income taxes, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share  .    The Company presents these non-GAAP measures because we   believe   they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are not indicative of our core business  .    In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing the Company s progress in achieving its long-term financial objectives.     The non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the Company s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.     The Company estimates the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments by applying its marginal rate to each of the respective items. 

Presented below   is a reconciliation of   GAAP and non-GAAP results for the thirteen and th  irty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively.    

17   

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures   (continued) 

During the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016, the Company   recorded a   non-cash impairment charge of $6 million ($5 million after-tax or $0.03 per share),   to write     down store fixtures and leasehold improvements   related to our Runners Point and Sidestep stores. Additionally d  uring the third quarter   of 2016  , the Company performed a scheduled reassessment of the value of intellectual property   previously   provided to   its   European busi  ness by Foot Locker in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2012.   Driven by the success of the European business   since the implementation of our tax planning strategy  , the   higher valuation   resulted in   catch-up     tax   deductions that reduced tax expense by   $  10 million,   or     $0.07   per share. 

During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $100 million, $61 million after-tax or $0.43 per share, related to pension litigation.  

Please see Item 1.  Financial Statements,  Note 3,   Impairment and   Litigation   Charges   and Note 13,   Legal Proceedings   for further information on these items.  

The Company estimates the tax effects of each of the non-GAAP adjustments individually by applying the applicable marginal tax rate to each of the respective items. 

Foreign Currency Fluctuations  

Throughout the following discussions, where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts using average foreign exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We believe that presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the changes in our business.

Results of Operations 

Sales 

All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales   of   stores     that   were   open at the period-end   and   ha  d   been open for more than one year  .     The computation of consolidated comparable-store sales also includes the sales of the Direct-to-Customers segment. S  tores opened   or   closed during the period are not included   in the comparable-store base; however, stores closed temporarily for relocation or remodeling are included. Computations   exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. 

Sales   increased   by $  92   million, or   5.1   percent, to $  1,886   million for the   thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , from $  1,794     million for the thirteen weeks ended   October 31, 2015  .   For the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October     29,     2016  , sales of $5,653 million increased 4.6 percent from sales of $  5,405   million in the corresponding prior-year period. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales increased by 5.5 percent and 4.9 percent for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016, respectively. 

Comparable-store sales   increased by   4.7   and   4.0   percent for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October     29,     2016  , respectively.    

Gross Margin 

The gross margin rate   improved by 10 basis points   for   both   the thirteen   and   thirty-nine     weeks ended     October     29,     2016  .   This reflected a   merchandise margin rate improvement of   10   and   20   basis points   for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016  , respectively.   The change in the gross margin rate also reflected an increase in the occupancy and buyer s compensation expense rate of 10 basis points for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016.  

The merchandise   margin   rate improvement   for both the quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016   primarily   reflected a   lower markdown   rate     within the Athletic Stores segment  ,   as we increased full-price selling. This improvement was   partially offset by increased   promotional activity     with  in our   D  irect-to-  C  ustomers segment   for both the current and year-to-date periods.     Also pressuring the gross margin rate was the fact that certain high-profile locations     were closed for remodeling for all or part of the year, which increased the   oc  cupancy expense rate since these locations were not generating sales while incurring tenancy costs.    

Selling, General and Administrative   Expenses   (SG A) 

SG   A increased by $  14     million and $49 million for the     thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively, as compared   with the corresponding prior-year period  s  . The effect of foreig  n currency fluctuations for the current quarter and year-to-date   period  s   was not significant.  

19   

Comparing the SG A rate to the prior-year periods, the rate decreased by 20 basis points for the thirteen   weeks ended   October 29, 2016, while it increased by 10 basis points for   the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016.   The change in the SG A rate was primarily driven by diligent expense management by our Athletic Stores segment, partially offset by an increase in marketing costs incurred by our Direct-to-Customers segment in order to drive traffic to its websites. While the higher expense rate within Direct-to-Customers segment continued during the third quarter, it was more pronounced in the first half of 2016, and therefore negatively affected the year-to-date comparison. 

Additionally, corporate expense for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 included an increase of $3 million   in costs   associated with the relocation of the corporate headquarters within New York City.    

Depreciation   a  nd Amortization  

Depreciation and   amortization increased by $  2   million   and $9 million for   the   thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period  s  . The increase in depreciation and amortization reflected increased capital spending   on store   projects  , enhancing our digital sites, and various other technologies   and infrastructure  . 

Impairment and Litigation Charges 

The Company recorded an impairment charge totaling $6 million ($5 million after-tax or $0.03 per diluted share) relating to the write-down of store fixtures and leasehold improvements for 116 of our Runners Point and Sidestep stores.  

During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a $100 million pension litigation charge ($61 million after-tax or $0.43 per diluted share).   This charge relates to a class action in which the plaintiffs alleged that the Company failed to properly disclose the effects of the 1996 conversion of the retirement plan to a defined benefit plan with a cash balance formula. In September 2015,   the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and issued a decision ordering that the pension plan be reformed. The Company is appealing the court s decision, and the judgment has been stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.  

Please see Item 1.  Financial Statements,  Note 3,   Impairment and   Litigation   Charges   and Note 13,   Legal Proceedings   for further information on these items.  

Interest Expense  , Net 

Net interest expense was unchanged for the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2016 as compared   with the corresponding prior-year period. For the thirty-nine weeks ended   October 29, 2016   net interest expense   decreased by   $1 million compared with the corresponding prior-year period, which primarily represented   increased income due   to   higher average interest rates   on our cash investments  .    

20   

Income Taxes 

The Company recorded income tax provisions of $7  0   million and $  248   million, which represented effective tax rate  s   of 3  0.9   percent   and 34.4 percent   for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016, respectively  . For the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 31, 2015  , the Company recorded income tax provisions of $  37   million and $  209   million, which represented effective tax rates of   31.7   percent and 3  5.3   percent, respectively.     The Company s interim provision for income taxes is measured using an annual effective tax rate adjusted for discrete items that occur within the periods presented. 

The Company regularly assesses the adequacy of its provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. As a result, the Company may adjust the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits considering new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes of limitation. For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016, the changes in the tax reserves were not significant. Included in the thirteen weeks and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 were tax benefits of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, from reserve releases due to expiration of statutes of limitation and settlements of tax examinations. 

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company performed a scheduled reassessment of the value of the intellectual property provided to its European business by Foot Locker in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2012. Driven by the recent success of the Foot Locker business in Europe, the new, higher valuation resulted in catch-up deductions that reduced tax expense by $10 million. The higher valuation will also result in a current year benefit, of which approximately $2 million was recognized during the third quarter with an additional $1 million that will be recognized during the fourth quarter. 

During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a pension-related litigation charge of $100 million with a related tax benefit of $39 million. The thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 also included tax benefits totaling $1 million related to an adjustment to deductible compensation costs resulting from executive changes and a Canadian provincial tax rate change. 

Excluding the reserve releases and other discrete items mentioned above, the effective tax rate for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 decreased as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods, due primarily to the current year effect of the higher valuation of the intellectual property provided from Foot Locker U.S. to its European business. 

The Company currently expects its fourth quarter and full-year tax rate to approximate 36 percent and 35 percent, respectively, excluding the effect of any additional nonrecurring items that may occur. The actual tax rates will depend primarily on the level and mix of income earned in the United States as compared with its international operations. 

Net Income 

For the thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , net income increased     by $  77   million  ,     or 96.3 percent, and     diluted earnings per share increased by 105.3 percent to $1.17 per share,     as compared with the c  orresponding prior-year period  . For the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , net income increased by $92 million, or 24.0 percent, above the corresponding prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share increased by 29.2 percent to $3.50 per share. In addition to the growth in net income for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, the increase in diluted earnings per share was also positively affected by the Company s continued share repurchase program.

Segment   Information 

The Company has determined that its reportable segments are those that are based on its method of internal reporting.   T  he Company has two reportable segments, Athletic Stores and Direct-to-Customers.   The Company evaluates performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is division results. Division   profit   reflects   income   before income taxes,   pension litigation charge,   corporate expense,     non-operating income, and net interest expense  .    The following table summarizes results by segment:    

(1)    

Included in the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 is a $6 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge to write-down long-lived store assets of Runners Point and Sidestep. See Item 1.  Financial Statements,  Note 3,   Impairment and   Litigation   Charges   for further information.  

(2)  

Included in the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 is a pre-tax litigation charge of $100 million relating to the pension litigation matter. Please see Item 1.  Financial Statements,  Note 13,   Legal Proceedings   for further information.   

(3)  

Other income includes non-operating items, such as lease termination gains, royalty income, insurance recoveries and the changes in fair value, premiums paid, and realized gains associated with foreign currency option contracts.   

Athletic Stores 

Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations,   Athletic Stores   segment sales increased by   5.0 percent and 4.5 percent   for the thirte  en and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively,   as compared with the corresponding prior-year period.   The sales increase for both the quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016 was driven by our domestic banners, led by Champs Sports. Our international sales growth for both the quarter and the full year was led by our Canadian businesses. Foot Locker Europe s sales increased for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, with the majority of the increase coming from the first half of the year, as the third quarter was negatively affected by reduced traffic. The Runners Point and Sidestep banners continued to experience sales declines.   Both of  

22   

these banners continue to face assortment and traffic challenges. We are focus  ed   on improving these banners by better diversifying our product offerings  ,   along with providing a more elevated in-store exp  erience  . 

Comparable-store sales   increased by   4.0   percent and   3.5   percent for the thirteen   and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively.   These increases were   primarily driven by our continued success in footwear.   C  hildren s   and     women s   footwear   sales increase  d   across multiple   banners   for the current quarter and year-to-date periods,   led   by court classic and casual styles.   The increase in m  en s footwear   sales     was largely driven by   casual styles,   especially in our   Champs Sports   banner  .    Our basketball footwear business was down slightly for the quarter, but represented a positive comparable gain for the year-to-date   period   led, by   Foot Locker Canada.    

Apparel sales also experienced gains for both the quarter and year-to-date period.   The strongest contributors were   sales of men s branded and private label apparel   at   Champs Sports. Additionally, Foot Locker Europe s apparel sales benefited during the year-to-date period with gai  ns in men s branded apparel.    

Athletic Stores division profit increased 3.4 percent and 5.2 percent for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016, respectively,   as compared with the corresponding prior-year period.   Division profit, as a percentage of sales decreased to 13.0 percent and increased to 13.8 percent for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior-year period. During the third quarter of 2016, a $6 million impairment charge was   recorded to write     down   the value of   store fixtures and leasehold improvements for 116 Runners Point and Sidestep stores. Excluding th  e effect of the impairment charge,   division profit increased as a percent  age   of sales by 20 and 30 basis points for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016, respectively  , as compared to the corresponding prior-year periods  . The division profit   rate   improvement, excluding the effect of the impairment charge,   was primarily due to   an improved merchandise margin rate  ,     reflecting   a lower markdown rate for both the quarter and year-to-date periods.    

D  irect-to-Customers 

Comparable  -  sales   for the     Direct-to-Customers   segment increased by   8.9   percent   and 7.7 percent   for the thirteen   and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively  .    This increase was primarily a result of the continued growth of ecommerce sales associated with our store-banner websites, both domestically and internationally, which was partially offset by declines in our Eastbay, Runners Point and Sidestep ecommerce businesses.  

Footwear continued to be our strongest category for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. This category was led by gains from the Jordan brand, women s casual styles, and children s footwear, each of which posted strong sales gains during the quarter and year-to-date periods. Eastbay s sales decreased for the quarter and year-to-date periods, which reflected the customer s continued shift away from performance-related product.  

Direct-to-Customers division profit for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 increased by $1 million and decreased by $6 million, respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods. Division profit, as a percentage of sales, was 13.2 percent for both the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016 as compared with 13.9 percent and 15.1 percent for the corresponding prior-year periods.   The division profit   rate   decline for the quarter and year-to-date periods primarily related to higher marketing related costs coupled with a lower gross margin rate within our domestic ecommerce business due to higher promotional activity.  

23   

Corporate Expense 

Corporate expense consists of unallocated   SG A  , as well as depreciation and amortization related to the Company s corporate headquarters, centrally managed departments, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and other items.   Depreciation and amortization included in corporate expense   was $  4   million and $  11   million for the thirteen and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively,     which   increased by $2 million and $3 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods.    

The allocation of corporate expense to the operating divisions is adjusted annually based upon an internal study; accordingly  , the allocation increased by $3   million   and $7 million   for the thirteen   and   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively,   thus reducing   corporate expense. Excluding the corporate allocation change as well as   the change attributable to   depreciation and amortization, corporate expense   decreased by   $  2   million   for the   thirteen weeks ended   October 29, 2016  ,    and increased by $3 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 29, 2016  . The increase for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October     29,     2016   was primarily   due to   costs incurred   to   relocat  e   our corporate headquarters within New York City  , which   was completed during the first quarter.   During 2016 we incurred $4 million of relocation-related expenses, as compared with $1 million during the prior-year period. 

Liquidity   a  nd Capital Resources 

Liquidity 

The Company s primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from   earnings  , while the principal uses of cash have been  :   to fund inventory and other working capital requirements;   to   finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store remodelings,   I  nternet and mobile sites, information systems, and other support facilities;   to   make retirement plan contributions, quarterly dividend payments, and interest payments; and   to   fund other cash requirements to support the development of its short-term and long-term operating strategies. The Company generally finances real estate with operating leases.     Management believes its cash, cash equivalents  , and   future cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund   these requirements  .   

The Company may   also   from time to time   repurchase its common stock or   seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions  ,   or otherwise.   Share repurchases and retirement of debt  , if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions  ,   and other factors.   The amounts involved may be material. As of   October 29, 2016  , approximately $285 million remained available under the Company s   $1   billion share repurchase program. 

As discussed further in the   Legal Proceedings   note under  Item 1. Financial Statements,    during the third quarter of 2015   the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $100 million  ,     ($61 million after-tax).   In light of the uncertainties involved in this matter, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not differ from the amount currently accrued by the Company. The $100 million charge has been classified as a long-term liability due to the uncertainty involved with the resolution of this litigation  ,   as the appeals process can be lengthy. The pension plan is   currently   sufficiently funded to absorb a $100 million liability and, accordingly, we do not anticipate the need to make any pension contributions in the near term   in connection with this matter  .    T  he timing and the amount of contributions to the pension plan   are   dependent on the funded status of the plan and various other factors, such as interest rates and the performance of the plan s assets. 

Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer acceptance of the Company s merchandise mix and retail locations, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, the Company s reliance on a few key vendors for a significant portion of its merchandise purchases and risks associated with global   product   sourcing  ,    economic conditions worldwide,   the effects of currency  

24   

fluctuations,   as well as other factors listed under the heading  Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,  could affect the ability of the Company to continue to fund its needs from business operations. 

Operating Activities 

The amount provided by operating activities reflects   net income adjusted for non-cash items   and working capital changes. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, and share-based related tax benefits  .    The increase from the prior year primarily reflects the Company s earnings strength. This was partially   offset by     $33 million   of contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan, which is an increase of $29 million as compared with the contribution made in the corresponding prior-year period. 

Investing   Activities 

Capital expenditures   were    $  20   million   higher than   the prior year  . The increase was due, in part, to the build out of our new corporate headquarters and two flagship stores in New York City. The Company also   increased spending on corporate technology projects. The Company s full  -  year forecast for capital expenditures is   expected to be approximately $290 million, which includes $220   million related to the remodeling or relocation of   approximately 220   existing stores and   opening   approximately   100   new store  s  , as well as $  70   million for the development of information systems, websites,     infrastructure  , and our corporate headquarters relocation within New York City  .   The prior year reflected a $2 million asset acquisition of 10 previously franchised Runners Point and Sidestep stores in Switzerland, of which $1 million was paid during the third quarter of 2015. 

Financing   Activities 

During the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016  , the Company   repurchased   5,874,643   shares   of its common stock   for $  352   million  ,   as compared with   5,050,000   shares   repurchased for $316   million in the corresponding prior-year period.   The Company declared and   paid dividends during the first three quarters of   2016   and   2015   of   $  111   million and     $  105   million, respectively.   This represent  ed   quarterly rates of $0.275   and $0.25 per share for   2016   and   2015  , respectively  . Additionally, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with employee stock programs of     $  28   million and $  68     million for the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October     29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  ,    respectively.  

In connection with stock option exercises and share-based compensation programs, the Company recorded excess tax benefits of $  16 million and $  33   million as a financing   activity for   the   thirty-nine   weeks ended   October 29, 2016    

25   

and   October 31, 2015  , respectively. The   reduction in the amount of the   excess tax benefit primarily reflected a lower number of stock option exercises during the first   three   quarter  s   of 2016 as compared with the prior     year.    

In May 2016, the Company entered into a new $400 million credit agreement and in connection with this transaction the Company paid fees of $2 million. The activity for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2015 also reflected payments made on capital lease obligations of $2 million.

There have been no significant changes to the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016  .

Item 4. Co    nt  rols and Procedures 

The Company s management performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), and completed an evaluation as of   October 29, 2016     of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )).

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

The Board of Directors and Shareholders 

Foot Locker, Inc.: 

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets of Foot Locker, Inc.   and subsidiaries as of October 29, 2016 and October 31  , 2015, and the related condensed consolidated statements of operations   and   comprehensive income   for the thirteen and t  hirty-nine   week periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , and   the related condensed consolidated statements of   cash flows for the   thirty-nine   week periods   ended October 29, 2016 and October 29  , 2015. These condensed consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.  

We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Foot Locker, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 30, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders  equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 24, 2016 we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 30, 2016, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
