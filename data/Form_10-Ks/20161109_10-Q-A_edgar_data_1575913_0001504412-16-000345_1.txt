GOLDEN EDGE ENTERTAINMENT, INC.    
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
  June 30, 2016  
 (Unaudited) 
   
  NOTE 1.   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS  
   
 Golden Edge Entertainment, Inc. ( the Company  or  the Issuer ) was organized under the name Retail Spicy Gourmet, Inc. under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 30, 2010. The name was changed to Golden Edge Entertainment, Inc. on February 26, 2013. The Company was established as part of the Chapter 11 reorganization of Spicy Gourmet Organics, Inc. ( SGO ). Under SGO s Plan of Reorganization, as confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, the Company was incorporated to: (1) receive and hold any interest which SGO had in the business of retail sales of imported spices; and (2) issue shares of its common stock to SGO's general unsecured creditors, to its administrative creditors, and to its shareholder. The Company incorporated its 100% owned subsidiary, Big Data Media, LLC., under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 1, 2016. On February 1, 2013 the Company resolved to enter the music production and distribution business. The Company intends to develop revenue by providing professional services to recording artists. Such services include production of recordings, management of the manufacture of CDs and internet uploading of music files, and management of the manufacture of promotional merchandise such as T-shirts and caps. As of June 30, 2016 had not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. Activities have consisted primarily of formation, establishing relationships with studio owners, engineers, technicians, and manufacturers with whom the Company can contract for services, and administrative efforts related to registration under the 1934 Act. 
   
  NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Basis of presentation  
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) as promulgated in the United States of America. The Company is a development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Bid Data Media LLC. The Company is still devoting substantially all of its efforts to establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced.  All losses accumulated since inception have been considered as part of the Company's development stage activities. 
   
  Estimates  
   
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.   Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  
   
  Earnings per share  
   
 The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ). The ASC 260  Earnings Per Share  specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock. 
   
 Basic net earnings (loss) per share amounts are computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Common equivalent equity instruments such as 4,600,000 warrants were not included in the loss per share calculations because the inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. The 4,600,000 warrants were outstanding as of June 30, 2016. 

Revenue recognition  
   
 The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Since inception, the Company has not recognized any revenue from operations. 
   
  Cash and cash equivalent  
   
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. 
   
  Derivative Financial Instruments  
   
 The Company evaluates all of its agreements to determine if such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. As of June 30, 2016, the Company s only derivative financial instrument was an embedded conversion feature associated with a convertible line of credit due to the conversion price being a percentage of the market price of the Company s stock at the date of conversion. 
   
  Stock based compensation  
   
 The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with the ASC 718  Shares-Based Compensation  FASB Accounting Standards Classification using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. 
   
  Income taxes  
   
 Income taxes are provided in accordance with the ASC 740  Income Tax  FASB Accounting Standards Classification. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 
   
  Recently adopted accounting standards  
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15, which is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, extends the responsibility for performing the going-concern assessment to management and contains guidance on how to perform a going-concern assessment and when going-concern disclosures would be required under U.S. GAAP. The Company elected to adopt ASU 2014-15 effective with this financial statement. Management s evaluations regarding the events and conditions that raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern have been disclosed in  Note 3- Going Concern. 

In April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, (Subtopic 835-30):  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  ASU No. 2015-03 provides guidance that will require debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. ASU No. 2015-03 affects disclosures related to debt issuance costs but does not affect existing recognition and measurement guidance for these items.  ASU No. 2015-03 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or disclosures.  
   
  Recently issued accounting standards  
   
 ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which provides guidance for revenue recognition for contracts. This guidance requires an entity to review contracts in five steps and will result in enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue arising from contracts with customers. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that this new guidance will have on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
 ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, was issued to simplify the classification of deferred taxes on the balance sheet. The new guidance would require that deferred taxes be classified as non-current assets and liabilities based on the taxpaying jurisdiction. Application of the standard, which can be applied prospectively or retrospectively, is required for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods within that year. The adoption of the amended guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
 ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued a new standard which requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.  The new guidance will require the asset and liability to be initially measured at the present value of the lease payments in the statement of financial position.  The new guidance will also require the company to recognize interest expense on the lease liability separately from the amortization of the right-use-asset for finance leases and recognize a single lease cost allocated on a straight-line basis over the lease term for operating leases, in the statement of comprehensive income.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years with early application permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

NOTE 3. GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company s operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including, among others, current and potential competitors with greater resources, dependence on significant customers, lack of operating history and uncertainty of future profitability and possible fluctuations in financial results. In accordance with ASU 2014-15, management has evaluated the company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management has determined that there is substantial doubt that the company will continue as a going concern due  to the Company's accumulated deficit of $243,915 as of June 30, 2016 ($167,173 - December 31, 2015).  The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtain additional financing, as may be required. 
   
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence. The officers and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs of the Company. 

NOTE 4. CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  
   
 The Company received on July 27, 2015, a total of $10,000 by issuance of one convertible note for $10,000. The convertible note is to pay to the order of the holder the sum of the promissory note at the time and in the manner provided. This convertible promissory note bear interest from the date of issuance at the rate of 8% per annum. This note is payable one year from the date of issuance. It is convertible any time at a fixed price of $0.40 per share. Commencing on the demand date, all principal and accrued interest shall be payable by the Company upon demand by the investor. 
   
 On September 9, 2015, the Company issued a convertible line of credit to an investor that provides for a maximum borrowing of $50,000.  As of June 30, 2016, the Company borrowed $46,250 under this convertible line of credit. The convertible line of credit (i) is unsecured, (ii) bears interest at the rate of 8% per annum, and (iii) is due on September 9, 2016.  The outstanding balance of under this convertible line of credit is convertible at any time at the option of the investor into shares of the Company s common stock that is determined by dividing the amount to be converted by 60% of the bid price on the day of conversion.   
   
 Due to the variable conversion price associated with this convertible line of credit, the Company has determined that the conversion feature is considered derivative liabilities.  Accordingly, the Company recorded a change in fair value of the derivative liability in the amount of $10,610 and $11,632 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.  There was no such transaction during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015. 
   
 The Company recognized financing costs of $7,267 and $7,533 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, and $24,324 and $27,937 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 related to the amortization of the debt discount. 
   
 The Company received on January 8, 2016, a total of $20,000 by issuance of one convertible note for $20,000. The convertible note is to pay to the order of the holder the sum of the promissory note at the time and in the manner provided. This convertible promissory note bear interest from the date of issuance at the rate of 8% per annum. This note is payable one year from the date of issuance. It is convertible any time at a fixed price of $0.20 per share. Commencing on the demand date, all principal and accrued interest shall be payable by the Company upon demand by the investor. 

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVE LIABILITY  
     
 The convertible line of credit discussed in Note 4 has a variable conversion price which results in the conversion feature being recorded as a derivative liability. 
   
 The fair value of the derivative liability is recorded and shown separately under current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liability is recorded in the statement of operations under other income (expense). 
   
   The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the following assumptions to measure the fair value of derivative liability at June 30, 2016. 

The following table represents the Company s derivative liability activity for the period ended June 30, 2016:

 On March 24, 2015, the board passed a resolution on electing to change the exercise price of Warrants A, B, C and D to $0.05 each and the expiry date of the warrants to November 19, 2017. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
   
 As of June 30, 2016 we had $3,164 in cash and $6,792 in capital assets, and as of December 31, 2015, our most recent year end, we had no cash and $1,400 in capital assets. 
   
 As of June 30, 2016 we had total liabilities of $124,775 (December 31, 2015 - $59,677) consisting of a accounts payable ($23,039), convertible notes payable ($58,100), and derivative liability ($43,636). 
   
 At June 30, 2016 we had an accumulated deficit of $243,915 and as of December 31, 2015, our last audit date, we had a deficit of $167,173. We will, in all likelihood, continue to sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues until we begin to produce recordings. 
   
 We are dependent upon our officers and shareholders to meet any expenses that may occur. Our president and other directors have agreed to provide the necessary funds, without interest, for the Company to comply with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, provided that they are officers and directors of the Company when the obligation is incurred. All advances are interest-free. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
 The Company has developed its business plan and has commenced marketing of its services but has realized no revenues to date. The Company s business plan calls for the Company to provide recording services to recording artists. It also calls for the Company to sell, on a special order, wholesale basis, CDs and promotional merchandise such as caps and T-shirts to recording artists. Recording artists typically sell such merchandise to their fans on a retail basis at concerts and through their own websites. This business model relieves the Company of the need to distribute, market, or sell such merchandise to the public. We may sell music that can be digitally downloaded from websites such as Apple s iTunes, but this will involve no cost to the Company once recording is completed, and recording costs are paid by the music artists or other clients. To the extent that we sell music through sites such as iTunes it will most likely be on a revenue sharing basis with the recording artists; this will compensate the Company for organizing the upload of the music. 
   
 For the three months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recorded operating expenses of $30,038 compared to $12,770 in the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase is due to higher professional fees and salaries in the 2016 period. 
   
 For the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recorded operating expenses of $52,904 compared to $20,630 in the six months ended June 30, 2015, again due to higher professional fees and salaries in the 2016 period. 
   
 The company had no derivative liabilities in the first six months of 2015, but recorded changes in derivative liabilities in the six months ended June 30, 2016.  
   
  GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company s operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including, among others, current and potential competitors with greater resources, dependence on significant customers, lack of operating history and uncertainty of future profitability and possible fluctuations in financial results. In accordance with ASU 2014-15, management has evaluated the company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management has determined that there is substantial doubt that the company will continue as a going concern due  to the Company's accumulated deficit of $243,915 as of June 30, 2016 ($167,173 - December 31, 2015).  The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtain additional financing, as may be required. 
   
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence. The officers and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs of the Company. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
   
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
 Our management team, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the last day of the fiscal period covered by this report, March 31, 2016. The term disclosure controls and procedures means our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not    effective at a reasonable assurance level. A control system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.
