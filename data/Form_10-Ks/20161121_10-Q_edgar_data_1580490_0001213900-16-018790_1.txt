  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND DECEMBER
31, 2015  

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS   

Evans Brewing Company Inc. (formerly
ALPINE 3 Inc.) ( EBC  or the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June
18, 2013. Alpine 3 Inc. was set up to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock, or
other business combination with a domestic or foreign business. Alpine 3 did not undertake any effort to cause a market to develop
in its securities, either debt or equity, before it successfully concluded a business combination. On April 4, 2014, The Michael
J. Rapport Trust (the  Trust ) purchased 10,000,000 shares of common stock, which was all of the outstanding shares
of Alpine 3, from the founder of Alpine 3, and changed the name to Evans Brewing Company Inc. on May 29, 2014. On October 9, 2014,
the Trust agreed to the cancellation of 9,600,000 of the shares of common stock that it had acquired and retained 400,000 shares
of common stock. 

On October 15, 2014, the Company entered
into an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Bayhawk Ales, Inc., a Delaware corporation
( Bayhawk ), subject to receiving approval of the independent Bayhawk shareholders who vote on the transaction. On
September 17, 2015, the independent Bayhawk shareholders approved the agreement by a vote of 251,212 shares for and 1,600 shares
against. As such, Bayhawk sold to EBC, and EBC purchased from Bayhawk, assets of Bayhawk, including but not limited to: (A) all
assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however
delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales label (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below); and (B) all assets,
including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated
relating to the Evans Brands (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below) (collectively, the  Transferred
Assets ). Bayhawk retained ownership of 100% of the stock in Evans Brewing Co (CA) ( Evans Brewing California )
which has the brewers license at City Brewery in Lacrosse, WI (where the non-craft brands will be brewed, with the balance of the
craft brands being brewed in Irvine, California). Based on the affirmative vote by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve
the Asset Purchase transaction, EBC proceeded with the share exchange and tender offer to the Bayhawk shareholders, pursuant to
which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk common stock, on a one-for-one basis (the  Exchange
Offer ). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2, 2015, to tender their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders
also had until December 2, 2015, to rescind the exchange of shares. There also was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common
stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the close of the share exchange on December 2, 2015, Premier Stock
Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4,033,863 Bayhawk shares and issued 4,033,863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October
15, 2014, as amended (the  Asset Purchase Agreement ). EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex
to a combination registration statement and proxy statement on Form S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the
Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. The asset purchase and share exchange have been treated as business combination as both companies
are controlled by the same management. 

The brewery continued to operate under
the Bayhawk Ales, Inc. name as it transitioned the licensing and branding over to Evans Brewing Company, Inc. That process has
been completed and all future activities will be under the Evans Brewing Company banner. Bayhawk Ales Inc. will be dissolved and
all of its history will become that of Evans Brewing Company, Inc. 

Evans Brewing Company is a craft brewery
based on Orange County, California that produces and sells premium craft beers, including a variety of ales and lagers. EBC s
beers are currently produced in its 17-barrel brewery in Irvine, California, the oldest continuously operating brewing facility
in Orange County and one of the oldest in all of Southern California. This facility has been producing craft beers since January
1995. 

EBC products include four beers that
are packaged year-round (Pollen Nation Honey Blonde Ale, The KrHOPen India Pale Ale, Oaklore Brown Ale, and Choc Latt 
Chocolate Porter), various draft-only offerings (which include The Joaquin Dead Mexican Red Ale, OC Pale Ale, Son of a Beach Blonde
Ale), and seasonal beers (which include Approachable Bastard Session IPA, Stout at the Devil Russian Imperial Stout, crHOP Dust
Hefeweizen, and Oktoberfest). EBC s labels for its year round packaging were approved in 2016 and the beers are currently
being sold with these labels. EBC has the exclusive rights to make, manufacture, produce, market, sell, and distribute original
beers, lagers, and ales known as Evans Lager Original, Evans Lager Black, Evans Lager Light, Bad Kat Ice, and Dead Presidents.
EBC also owns the assets of Pig s Eye Brewing Company, LLC, (the  EBC Malt Assets ) including the intellectual
property and trademarks relating to original beers, lagers, and ales, including Milwaukee Select and Pig s Eye (the  EBC
Malt Brands ). EBC s products are distributed to restaurants and other retail outlets in nine states. EBC also produces
and packages kegged beer on a private label basis for restaurants and other customers, with the names for such products determined
collaboratively with such customer and each product co-branded with the phrase  by Evans Brewing Company . 

In addition to manufacturing and selling
the products above, EBC also produces and packages beers for other craft breweries in Southern California on a contract-basis.
Further, in addition to beer production and sales generally, EBC also produces and offers for sale certain  Evans Brewing
Company  branded merchandise including apparel, glassware and other beer accessories. 

On September 29, 2016, Evans Brewing
Company, Inc., closed the acquisition of a restaurant business located in the downtown SOCO District of Fullerton, California,
through the acquisition of all the outstanding stock of EBC Public House, Inc., which the Company now operates as its first branded
restaurant and taproom under the trade name  The Public House by Evans Brewing Company . The Public House features
the Company s beers   as well as beers from other selected local Orange County, California breweries, -- food and,
potentially, occasional entertainment. 

In connection with such closing, the
Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of EBC Public House from Mr. Rapport and issued 1,000,000 shares of the Company s
Series A Preferred Stock to Mr. Rapport. The asset purchase and share exchange have been treated as business combination as both
companies are controlled by the same management. 

In connection with the closing of the transactions, the Company
and Michael J. Rapport also entered into an Indemnification Agreement for Closing Date Liabilities (the  Indemnification
Agreement ) pursuant to which Mr. Rapport agreed to indemnify the Company for liabilities accrued as of the closing.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

Basis of Presentation  

This summary of accounting policies
for EBC is presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial statements. The Company uses the accrual basis of
accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and have been
consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements. 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for allowances for
bad debts, collectability of accounts receivable, amounts due to service providers, depreciation and litigation contingencies,
among others. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

For purposes of the statement of cash
flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents
to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. The Company has no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015. 

Accounts Receivable  

Accounts receivable are customer obligations
due under normal trade terms. EBC performs continuing credit evaluations of customers and allowances are maintained for potential
credit losses. EBC determined an allowance for doubtful accounts of $12,791at September 30, 2016 and for December 31, 2015, to
be appropriate. 

Inventories  

Inventories are valued at the lower
of cost or market. EBC regularly reviews its inventories for the presence of obsolete product attributed to age, seasonality, and
quality and reduces its cost basis when its review indicates a reduction in utility below the inventory's carrying value. Inventories
consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Deposits  

During the quarter ended September 30,
2016, EBC had a return on can deposit of $67,500 from a third-party that cans its product, reducing the original deposit of $135,000
in half for a deposit balance of $67,500 as of the quarter ended September 30, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, The can deposit was
$135,000. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are stated at
cost. Depreciation is computed by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives: 

Building improvements     
     20 years  
 
     Leasehold improvements     
     10 years  
 
     Brewery equipment     
     3 - 20 years  
 
     Furniture and fixtures     
     5 years  
 
     Software    
     3 years  
 
     Vehicles     
     5 - 10 years  

5  

EBC capitalizes significant capital
expenditures. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as expenses when incurred. When assets are sold or retired,
the costs and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss
is included in the income. Total depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, was
$50,708 and $58,749, respectively. 

Impairment of long-lived assets  

EBC evaluates its long-lived assets
by measuring the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them. At the
time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover
the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values. No adjustment to the carrying value of the assets
has been made. 

Accounts Payable  

Accounts payable consists of unpaid
expenses incurred in the normal course of business. 

Refundable deposits  

EBC distributes its draft beer in kegs
that are owned by the Company. When a draft beer is shipped to the customer, the Company collects a refundable deposit and records
a liability. Upon return of the keg, the deposit is refunded to the customer and the liability is reduced. As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, EBC had refundable deposits in the amounts of $102,746 and $107,574, respectively. EBC accounts for
the loss, breakage, and deterioration of the kegs by crediting the customer s deposits. The deposit approximates EBC s
cost of the keg. Any additional cost incurred for the loss, breakage, or deterioration of the kegs is then billed to the customer.
Management periodically reviews its refundable deposits for any loss allowance on loss, breakage, or deterioration and has determined
that no allowance was necessary as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Revenue Recognition  

Revenue from product sales, are recognized
when the products are picked up by individual customers or shipped to wholesale customers. The following criteria are met before
revenue is recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, shipment of product or pickup has occurred, selling price
is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Product returns are allowed, but are rare according to historical
records for past years. EBC continuously monitors and evaluates product returns. There was no allowance for product returns as
of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015. 

Sales Tax  

EBC excludes from its sales all sales
taxes assessed to its customers. Sales taxes assessed are recorded as accrued liabilities on the balance sheet until remitted to
the state agencies. 

Excise Tax  

The federal government levies excise
taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages, including beer. For brewers producing fewer than two million barrels of beer per calendar
year, the federal excise tax is $7 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale during the calendar
year. The state of California imposes excise taxes on the sale and distribution of beer at a rate of $0.20 per gallon. Excise taxes
due to federal and state agencies are not collected from customers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, excise taxes amounted to approximately $90,914 and $68,307 respectively, which is treated as a
Cost of Goods sold. 

Uncertain Tax Positions  

EBC utilizes the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of the  Expenses   Income Taxes Topic 
of the FASB ASC. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers certain tax planning strategies in its assessment as to
the recoverability of its tax assets. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect
for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the tax rate changes. EBC recognizes, in
its financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based
on technical merits of the position. There are no material unrecognized tax positions in the financial statements. 

6  

EBC accounts for uncertain tax positions
in accordance with FASB ASC 740 (formerly Financial Accounting Standards Boards Interpretation No. 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ). FASB ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
process for financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation
also provides guidance on recognition, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure
and transition. The Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740 and there was no impact on total liabilities or stockholder's
equity as a result of the adoption of FASB ASC 740. 

For federal tax purposes the Company s
2012 through 2015 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under normal three-year statute of limitations.
Generally, for state tax purposes, the Company s 2011 through 2015 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities
under a four-year statute of limitations. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

Fair value of certain of the Company s
financial instruments including cash, account payable, accrued expenses, notes payables, and other accrued liabilities approximate
cost because of their short maturities. The Company measures and reports fair value in accordance with ASC 820,  Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures  which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value investments. 

Fair value, as defined in ASC 820, is
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. The fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best use by market participants, principal (or
most advantageous) markets, and an in-use or an in-exchange valuation premise. The fair value of a liability should reflect the
risk of nonperformance, which includes, among other things, the Company s credit risk. 

Valuation techniques are generally classified
into three categories: the market approach; the income approach; and the cost approach. The selection and application of one or
more of the techniques may require significant judgment and are primarily dependent upon the characteristics of the asset or liability,
and the quality and availability of inputs. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under ASC 820 must maximize the use
of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC 820 also provides fair value hierarchy for inputs and resulting
measurement as follows: 

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the
asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values. 

Fair value measurements are required
to be disclosed by the Level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. Fair
value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (in Level 3 measurements) are subject to expanded disclosure requirements
including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances, separately presenting changes during the period attributable to
the following: (i) total gains or losses for the period (realized and unrealized), segregating those gains or losses included in
earnings, and a description of where those gains or losses included in earning are reported in the statement of income. 

Basic Loss Per Share  

Basic income (loss) per share is calculated
by dividing the Company's net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the
period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by
the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. 

7  

The Company has no dilutive debt instruments. 

New Authoritative Accounting Guidance  

The FASB issued ASU 2015-11 in July,
2015, to provide guidance on how an entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net
realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable
costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amendments in this Update more closely align the measurement of inventory
in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). For public business entities,
the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this Update should be applied
prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-15 on August 27, 2014, providing guidance on determining when and how to disclose
going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments
of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An
entity must provide certain disclosures if  conditions or events raise substantial doubt about [the] entity s ability
to continue as a going concern.  The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December
15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. 

The Company
has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect.  These pronouncements did not have any material impact
on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The following summarized the
earnings per share:

NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES  

Deferred income taxes are provided for
the temporary differences between the carrying values of the Company s assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and their corresponding income tax basis. The temporary differences give rise to either a deferred tax asset or liability in the
consolidated financial statements, which is computed by applying current statutory tax rates to taxable and deductible temporary
differences based upon the classification (i.e. current or non-current) of the asset or liability in the consolidated financial
statements which relates to the particular temporary difference. Deferred taxes related to differences which are not attributable
to a specific asset or liability are classified in accordance with the future period in which they are expected to reverse and
be recognized for income tax purposes. The long-term deferred tax assets are fully valued as of September 30, 2016, and December
31, 2015. 

As of September 30, 2016, and December
31, 2015, the components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily consist of temporary differences
attributable to differing methods of depreciation, insurance claim receivables, net operating losses, allowances for obsolete inventory,
and reserves for bad debt. 

EBC s management used 34% to calculate
the deferred tax assets and the current tax provision.  Because of the startup costs of EBC and the net operating losses earned
by Bayhawk during the first few years in operation, the Company has had to pay very little federal income tax.  In 2015 the
Company paid no federal income tax but did pay $13,995 in State taxes. The Company has filed its 2015 return and will receive a
refund of $10,400. The Company has booked a prepaid expense in the amount of $10,400 to account for this. The Company has not incurred
a federal tax obligation as of the period ended September 30, 2016 and EBC management expects that the Company will not pay any
federal income tax in 2016, due to its significant net operating losses.

Business History of Company  

Evans Brewing Company, Inc. (formerly
ALPINE 3 Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 18, 2013. Alpine 3 Inc. was set up to serve as
a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign
business. ALPINE 3 did not undertake any effort to cause a market to develop in its securities, either debt or equity, before it
successfully concluded a business combination. On April 4, 2014, The Michael J. Rapport Trust (the  Trust ) purchased
10,000,000 shares of common stock which was all of the outstanding shares of Alpine 3, Inc., and subsequently changed the name
to Evans Brewing Company Inc. ( EBC ) on May 29, 2014. On October 9, 2014 the Trust agreed to the cancellation of 9,600,000
of the shares of common stock that it had acquired and retained 400,000 shares of common stock. From April 2014 through December
2015, EBC has been in the process of acquiring the Bayhawk brands and related assets, as discussed in more detail below. 

On October 15, 2014, Bayhawk and EBC
entered into an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement (the  Agreement ), subject to receiving approval of the
independent Bayhawk shareholders who voted on the transaction. On September 17, 2015, the independent Bayhawk shareholders approved
the agreement by a vote of 251,212 shares for and 1,600 shares against. As such, Bayhawk sold to EBC, and EBC purchased from Bayhawk,
assets of Bayhawk, including but not limited to: (A) all assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory,
contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales label (as defined in the Agreement
and discussed in more detail below); and (B) all assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts,
websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (as defined in the Agreement and discussed
in more detail below) (collectively, the  Transferred Assets ). Bayhawk retained ownership of 100% of the stock in
Evans Brewing Co. (CA) ( Evans Brewing California ) which has the brewers license at City Brewery in Lacrosse, WI (where
the non-craft brands will be brewed, with the balance of the craft brands being brewed in Irvine, California). Based on the affirmative
vote by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the Asset Purchase transaction, EBC proceeded with the share exchange and
tender offer to the Bayhawk shareholders, pursuant to which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk
common stock, on a one-for-one basis (the  Exchange Offer ). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2, 2015, to tender
their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders also had until December 2, 2015, to rescind the exchange of shares.
There was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the close
of the share exchange on December 2, 2015, Premier Stock Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4,033,863 Bayhawk shares and issued
4,033,863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange
Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014, as amended (the  Asset Purchase Agreement ). EBC
filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration statement and proxy statement on Form S-4.
The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. The asset purchase and share exchange
has been treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management.

Overview   

The brewery continued to operate under
the Bayhawk Ales, Inc. name as it transitioned the licensing and branding over to Evans Brewing Company, Inc. That process has
been completed and all future activities will be under the Evans Brewing Company banner. Bayhawk Ales Inc. will be dissolved and
all of its history will become that of Evans Brewing Company, Inc. 

Evans Brewing Company is a craft brewery
based on Orange County, California that produces and sells premium craft beers, including a variety of ales and lagers. EBC s
beers are currently produced in its 17-barrel brewery in Irvine, California, the oldest continuously operating brewing facility
in Orange County and one of the oldest in all of Southern California. This facility has been producing craft beers since January
1995. The brewery is located in a leased building in the McCormick   Schmick s Seafood Restaurant. 

EBC products include four beers that
are packaged year-round (Pollen Nation Honey Blonde Ale, The KrHOPen India Pale Ale, Oaklore Brown Ale, and Choc Latt 
Chocolate Porter), various draft-only offerings (which include The Joaquin Dead Mexican Red Ale, OC Pale Ale, Son of a Beach Blonde
Ale), and seasonal beers (which include Approachable Bastard Session IPA, Stout at the Devil Russian Imperial Stout, crHOP Dust
Hefeweizen, and Oktoberfest). EBC s labels for its year round packaging were approved in 2016 and the beers are currently
being sold with these labels. EBC has the exclusive rights to make, manufacture, produce, market, sell, and distribute original
beers, lagers, and ales known as Evans Lager Original, Evans Lager Black, Evans Lager Light, Bad Kat Ice, and Dead Presidents.
EBC also owns the assets of Pig s Eye Brewing Company, LLC, (the  EBC Malt Assets ) including the intellectual
property and trademarks relating to original beers, lagers, and ales, including Milwaukee Select and Pig s Eye (the  EBC
Malt Brands ). EBC s products are distributed to restaurants and other retail outlets in nine states. EBC also produces
and packages kegged beer on a private label basis for restaurants and other customers, with the names for such products determined
collaboratively with such customer and each product co-branded with the phrase  by Evans Brewing Company . 

In addition to manufacturing and selling
the products above, EBC also produces and packages beers for other craft breweries in Southern California on a contract-basis.
Further, in addition to beer production and sales generally, EBC also produces and offers for sale certain  Evans Brewing
Company  branded merchandise including apparel, glassware and other beer accessories. 

On September 29, 2016, Evans Brewing
Company, Inc., closed the acquisition of a restaurant business located in the downtown SOCO District of Fullerton, California,
through the acquisition of all the outstanding stock of EBC Public House, Inc., which the Company now operates as its first branded
restaurant and taproom under the trade name  The Public House by Evans Brewing Company . The Public House features
the Company s beers   as well as beers from other selected local Orange County, California breweries, -- food and,
potentially, occasional entertainment. 

In connection with such closing, the
Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of EBC Public House from Mr. Rapport and issued 1,000,000 shares of the Company s
Series A Preferred Stock to Mr. Rapport. The asset purchase and share exchange have been treated as business combination as both
companies are controlled by the same management. 

In connection with the closing of the transactions,
the Company and Michael J. Rapport also entered into an Indemnification Agreement for Closing Date Liabilities (the  Indemnification
Agreement ) pursuant to which Mr. Rapport agreed to indemnify the Company for liabilities accrued as of the closing. 

Background  

EBC and Bayhawk filed a registration
statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Registration Statement ), which went effective
on August 10, 2015. The Registration Statement included a proxy statement seeking the votes of the Bayhawk shareholders on the
Asset Purchase Transaction by written consent. On September 17, 2015, the voting period closed, and EBC announced that approximately
99% of the shares that were voted had voted in favor of the Asset Purchase Transaction. 

In connection with the Asset Purchase
Transaction, EBC and Bayhawk entered into a General Assignment and Bill of Sale agreement (the  Bill of Sale ) which
outlined the specific assets purchased, as well as an Assignment and Assumption of Liabilities agreement (the  Assumption
Agreement) which outlined the specific liabilities of Bayhawk assumed by EBC. 

14  

In connection with the closing of the
Asset Purchase Transaction and the entry into the Bill of Sale and the Assumption Agreement, EBC acquired the assets (other than
the ownership of Evans Brewing California), the liabilities, and the operations of Bayhawk. As such, on December 10, 2015, in connection
with this acquisition, EBC ceased to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2, in that it had assets consisting of more than
cash and cash equivalents, and has a business plan and operations. 

Bayhawk Ales 

Bayhawk Ales, Inc. (formerly Orange
County Brewing Company) ( Bayhawk ) was formed in February 1994 for the purpose of developing and operating one or
more breweries in California for the production of high quality, hand-crafted ales for sale in bottle and draft. The Company built
a 17-barrel showcase brewery (the  Southern California Brewery ) in a leased building in the McCormick   Schmick s
Seafood Restaurant in Irvine, California. The Southern California Brewery, located in the central business district of Irvine near
John Wayne International Airport, began brewing beer in January 1995. Irvine is south of Los Angeles and is adjacent to Newport
Beach. It is a suburban city of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area and the location of numerous businesses. At the time
of the construction of the Southern California Brewery, the Los Angeles metropolitan area was the largest single market for beer
in the United States. The products produced by Bayhawk are 90% private labeled. The business has only recently in the last few
years become profitable. 

Evans Brewing Company, Inc. (Formerly
ALPINE 3, Inc.) was incorporated in Delaware in June 18 th , 2013 with a fiscal year ending on December 31st. 

Principal
Products

beers: Pollen Nation Honey Blonde Ale, The KrHOPen India Pale Ale, Oaklore Brown Ale, and Choc Latt  Chocolate Porter;
draft-only offerings include The Joaquin Dead Mexican Red Ale, OC Pale Ale, Son of a Beach Blonde Ale; and seasonals include Approachable
Bastard Session IPA, Stout at the Devil Russian Imperial Stout, crHOP Dust Hefeweizen, and Oktoberfest.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  

Closing of Asset Purchase Transaction  

On December 10, 2015, EBC completed
the previously announced acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Bayhawk, pursuant to an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange
Agreement between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014 (subsequently amended and restated on August 6, 2015 (as amended, the
 Agreement )). 

Pursuant to the Agreement, Bayhawk had
agreed to sell, and EBC had agreed to purchase, substantially all of Bayhawk s assets, as well as its liabilities (collectively,
the  Asset Purchase Transaction ). The assets and liabilities of Bayhawk include personal property, intellectual property,
inventory, selected distribution contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Bayhawk
Ales labels; and (B) all assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts, websites, documents,
and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (collectively, the  Transferred Assets ), and
the assumption by EBC, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, of all of the liabilities of Bayhawk (the
 Assumed Liabilities ). (The  Evans Brands  include the former assets of Pig s Eye Brewing Company,
including its original beers, lagers and ales ( Pig s Eye Brands ), as well as Evans Lager Original, Evans Lager
Black, Evans Lager Light, Bad Kat Ice, and Dead Presidents.) Pursuant to the Agreement, EBC has the right to purchase from Bayhawk
100% ownership in Evans Brewing California. 

15  

Pursuant to the Agreement, EBC and Bayhawk
agreed to seek approval of the shareholders of Bayhawk relating to the Asset Purchase Transaction. Because the principal majority
stockholders of Bayhawk are also significant stockholders of EBC, Bayhawk and EBC agreed to proceed with the Asset Purchase Transaction
if it was approved by the holders of at least a majority of the Independent Shares (i.e. shares not held by Bayhawk s majority
shareholder, The Michael J. Rapport Trust, or by Evan Rapport, who is an officer of EBC and the son of Michael Rapport) that actually
vote on the Asset Purchase Transaction proposal. 

EBC and Bayhawk filed a registration
statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Registration Statement ), which went effective
on August 10, 2015. The Registration Statement included a proxy statement seeking the votes of the Bayhawk shareholders on the
Asset Purchase Transaction by written consent. On September 17, 2015, the voting period closed, and EBC announced that approximately
99% of the shares that were voted had voted in favor of the Asset Purchase Transaction. 

In connection with the Asset Purchase
Transaction, EBC and Bayhawk entered into a General Assignment and Bill of Sale agreement (the  Bill of Sale ) which
outlined the specific assets purchased, as well as an Assignment and Assumption of Liabilities agreement (the  Assumption
Agreement) which outlined the specific liabilities of Bayhawk assumed by EBC. 

Equipment Lease to Bayhawk  

Following the closing of the Asset Purchase
Transaction, EBC entered into an equipment lease (the  Equipment Lease ) with Bayhawk pursuant to which EBC leased
the brewing equipment to Bayhawk. The Equipment Lease was effective as of December 1, 2015, and continues month to month. Bayhawk
agreed to pay a minimum of $15,000 per month or net profits from operations, whichever is greater. The title to the leased equipment
will remain with EBC, and EBC has the right to inspect the equipment and its usage. 

The foregoing summaries of the terms
and conditions of the Bill of Sale, the Assumption Agreement, and the Equipment Lease (collectively, the  Ancillary Agreements )
do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the specific Ancillary Agreement,
each of which was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by EBC on December 15, 2015. 

Change in Shell Company Status  

In connection with the closing of the
Asset Purchase Transaction and the entry into the Bill of Sale and the Assumption Agreement, EBC acquired the assets (other than
the ownership of Evans Brewing California), the liabilities, and the operations of Bayhawk. As such, on December 10, 2015, in connection
with this acquisition, EBC ceased to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2, in that it has assets consisting of more than
cash and cash equivalents, and has a business plan and operations. 

Share Exchange  

As discussed in more detail above and
below in this Annual Report, as partial consideration for the purchase of the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities, EBC agreed to offer to exchange shares of EBC common stock for all shares of Bayhawk common stock that were tendered
in connection with such offer, the transaction being referred to as the  Share Exchange.  The ratio of the share exchange
is one (1) share of EBC common stock for each one (1) share of Bayhawk common stock. 

Based on the affirmative vote by the
independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the Asset Purchase transaction, EBC proceeded with the share exchange and tender offer
to the Bayhawk shareholders, pursuant to which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk common
stock, on a one-for-one basis (the  Exchange Offer ). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2, 2015, to tender their
Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders also had until December 2, 2015, to rescind the exchange of shares.
There was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the close
of the share exchange on December 2, 2015, Premier Stock Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4,033,863 Bayhawk shares and issued
4,033,863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange
Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014, as amended (the  Asset Purchase Agreement ). EBC
filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration statement and proxy statement on Form S-4.
The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. The asset purchase and share exchange
will be treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management. 

16  

No Change of Control  

In connection with the Asset Purchase
Transaction, there was no change in control of EBC. The officers and directors of EBC did not change, and the majority ownership
of EBC did not change. 

As noted, prior to the closing of the
Share Exchange, there was no way to determine how many shares of Bayhawk common stock will be exchanged for shares of EBC common
stock. Nevertheless, Michael J. Rapport owns, through The Michael J. Rapport Trust, a majority of the outstanding common stock
of both EBC and Bayhawk. As such, following the closing of the Share Exchange, Mr. Rapport continued to own a majority of the common
stock of EBC, and as such, there was no change in control of EBC. 

Public House Stock Purchase Agreement  

Additionally on December 10, 2015, EBC
entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Public House SPA ) with Michael J. Rapport, as the sole shareholder of
EBC Public House, Inc., a California corporation ( Public House ), for the purchase by EBC of 100% of the outstanding
shares of Public House from Mr. Rapport, with the transaction to be closed following completion of due diligence and certain other
conditions outlined below. 

By way of background, Mr. Rapport formed
Public House to purchase a restaurant business located in Fullerton, California (previously operated as Steamers Jazz Club). Public
House is working to renovate and remodel the restaurant, with plans to open in September of 2016. Mr. Rapport was the sole shareholder
of Public House. 

Pursuant to the Public House SPA, EBC
agreed to issue 1,000,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock (see description below) in exchange for 100% of the outstanding
stock of Public House (the  Public House Shares ). The parties anticipate the closing of the transaction once the following
conditions, among others, have been met: 

-  
      Public House shall have received all food and beverage licenses, including California Alcoholic Beverage Control licenses, required for the operation of the business;   

-  
      The renovations and remodeling of the restaurant shall have been completed and the restaurant shall be open for business; and   

-  
      Other standard closing conditions.   

The foregoing summary of the terms and
conditions of the Public House SPA does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the Public House SPA, was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by EBC on December 15, 2015. 

EBC has provided additional information
relating to EBC Public House and the restaurant business, including disclosures required by SEC rules and regulations in this quarterly
report based on the closing of the purchase of the Public House Shares. 

Certificate of Designation  
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock  

In connection with the Public House
SPA, on December 10, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors approved and adopted a Certificate of Designation of Rights and
Preferences for Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Certificate of Designation ). On December 11, 2015, the

Incorporation, as amended to date. 

17  

Pursuant to the Certificate of Designation,
the Company is authorized to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Preferred

If the Common Stock of the Company is not trading on the conversion date, the conversion price shall be the Stated Value of the Preferred Stock.   

-  
      Redemption: The Company has the obligation to redeem the unconverted shares of Preferred Stock from the holder as follows:

in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

The foregoing summary of the terms and
conditions of the Certificate of Designation does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the full text of the Certificate of Designation, was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by EBC on December
15, 2015.

Results of Operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015  

Our operating results are summarized
as follows: 

Revenues   

During the quarter ended September 30,
2016, the Company had sales of $488,206 compared to $411,039, for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase in sales for
the current quarter compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015 is due mainly to two factors; The increase in bottle sales
for Evans Brewing Company and the increase in Malt liquor sales. The Malt liquor sales were low last quarter because of a lack
of cans based upon the fact that the company that supplies the aluminum cans ran into a production problem and was not able to
deliver the normal supply of cans that were needed to meet the production and sales needs of the Company to package the malt liquor.
Upon getting those cans this quarter Sales were higher than normal because it included fulfillment of sales orders from last quarter.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had sales of $1,329,430 compared to sales of $1,514,259 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The reason for the large decrease in sales again was due in part to the lack of cans available
to package the Company s malt liquor production to meet sales delivery requirements and reduced sales of private label beers. 

Operating Expenses   

The operating expenses for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, were $601,727 compared to $245,581 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating
expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared the quarter ended September 30, 2015, is due to an increase in professional
expenses of $38,074. Most of the increase was attributable to costs associated with the annual shareholders meeting in June and
legal expenses associated with filings and work associated with the raising of funds through an equity purchase agreement. Selling
expenses have also increased by $40,000 due to an increase in the sales force and there was a stock award for bonuses and board
of director fess of $236,000. The operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $1,014,431 compared to
$615,464 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in expenses for the current nine-month period compared to the
same six-month period last year was again due to the increase in professional expenses attributable to costs for the annual shareholders
meeting and legal expenses associated with the raising of funds through an equity purchase agreement along with costs of bonuses
and stock awards and increase in selling expenses. 

Net Loss from Operations:   

The net loss from operations for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, was $427,454 compared to a net loss from operations of $36,191 for the quarter ended September
30, 2015. The increase in the net loss from operations for current quarter compared to the same quarter last year is due to an
increase in operating expenses as outlined above. The net loss from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was
$687,404 compared to a net loss from operations of $167,568 for the same period last year. Again the increase in net loss from
operations for this nine-month period ended on September 30, 2016, compared to the same period last year is due to a decrease in
sales and an increase in operating expenses as outlined above in the operating expenses paragraph. 

19  

Interest Expense   :  

Interest expense for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, was $6,352, compared to $4,789 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense for
the current quarter compared to the same quarter last year is due to an increase in the total notes outstanding from a related
party. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $15,784 compared to $7,323 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. Again the increase in interest expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the
same nine-month period last year is due to an increase in the amount of the notes payable held by a related party. 

Other Income (Expense  ): 

Other income for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, was $4,142, compared to other income of $13,391 for the period ended September 30, 2015. The increase in other
income for the period ended September 30, 2015, was a one-time insurance payment in excess of the insurance claim recorded by the
Company. Other Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $5,163 compared to $22,410 for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2015. Again the increase in the prior period was due mainly to the insurance payment in excess of the insurance claim. 

Net Loss:   

Net loss for the quarter ended September
30, 2016, is $429,665 compared to a loss of $30,529 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net operating loss
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period last year was due to a large increase in operating expense
as note above offset by a small increase in sale as noted above. Net Loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, is
$698,026 compared to a loss of $155,421 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Again this net loss for the current
nine-month period compared to the same period last year is mainly attributable to a decrease in sales and a large increase in operating
expenses as noted above. 

Taxes:   

Taxes for the quarter ended September
30, 2016, are $1,508 compared to taxes of $11,650 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Taxes for the current quarter are State
taxes paid to the State of California. The tax amount paid in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, was an overpayment and The
Company will get most of that payment back in the last quarter of 2016. Taxes for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016,
are $1,508 compared to $11,900 for the none-month period ended September 30, 2015. The narrative is the same for the nine month
period as it is for the 3 month period. 

Net Loss after taxes:   

Net loss after taxes for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, is $431,173 compared to a loss of $42,179 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Net Loss for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, is $699,534 compared to a loss of $167,321 for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Working Capital   

20  

Cash Flows   

Cash Used In Operating Activities  

Our net loss for the period ended September
30, 2016, was the main contributing factor for our negative operating cash flow. 

Cash from Financing Activities  

As of September 30, 2016, we have insufficient
cash to operate our business at the current level for the next twelve months and to achieve our business goals unless there is
an additional infusion of cash. Subsequent to the end of the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company s FORM
S-1 statement previously filed by the Company, wherein the Company registered 425,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the terms
of the Equity Purchase Agreement with Kodiak Capital Group, LLC, became effective on October 25, 2016. The agreement calls for
the Company to receive $1,000,000 in exchange for the shares. Future profits will provide additional working capital. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements
between the Company and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to stockholders.    

Impact of Inflation  

The business will have to absorb any
inflationary increases on development costs in the short-term, with the expectation that it will be able to pass inflationary increases
on costs on to customers through price increases hence management does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in our business. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

21  

Management believes that the application
of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful and reliable financial information about our operating results
and financial condition.  Some of the critical accounting estimates are detailed below. 

Critical Accounting Estimates
and New Accounting Pronouncements   

Critical Accounting Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements.  Management considers an accounting estimate
to be critical if: 

it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and   

changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.   

The Company bases its estimates and
judgments on our experience, our current knowledge, and our beliefs of what could occur in the future, our observation of trends
in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We have identified the following accounting policies
and estimates as those that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations and that require
management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties: share-based compensation
expense, income taxes, and derivative financial instruments.  

Share-Based Compensation Expense .   The
Company plans to calculate share-based compensation expense for option awards and warrant issuances ( Share-based Awards )
based on the estimated grant/issue-date fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model ( Black-Sholes Model ),
and recognize the expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures.   The
Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions including volatility of the stock price, the weighted average risk-free
interest rate, and the vesting period of the Share-based Award in determining the fair value of Share-based Awards.  Although
we believe our assumptions used to calculate share-based compensation expense are reasonable, these assumptions can involve complex
judgments about future events, which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty.  In addition, significant changes
to our assumptions could significantly impact the amount of expense recorded in a given period. 

Income Taxes .  As part
of the process of preparing our financial statements, the Company will be required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions
in which we operate. Our provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach to account for income
taxes. A current liability is recorded for the estimated taxes payable for the current year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted
tax rates in effect for the year in which the timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates or tax laws are recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that
includes the enactment date.  Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to
the amount more-likely-than-not to be realized.  Changes in valuation allowances will flow through the statement of operations
unless related to deferred tax assets that expire unutilized or are modified through translation, in which case both the deferred
tax asset and related valuation allowance are similarly adjusted. Where a valuation allowance was established through purchase
accounting for acquired deferred tax assets, any future change will be credited or charged to income tax expense. 

The determination of our provision for
income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.  In
the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  In
spite of our belief that we have appropriate support for all the positions taken on our tax returns, we acknowledge that certain
positions may be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities.  We determine the tax benefits more likely than not
to be recognized with respect to uncertain tax positions.  Although we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities
are reasonable, tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and inherent uncertainty; therefore, our assessments can
involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely on estimates and assumptions.  Although we believe
these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, the final determination could be materially different than that which is reflected
in our provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities.

New Accounting Pronouncements   

 The FASB issued ASU 2015-11 in July,
2015, to provide guidance on how an entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net
realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable
costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amendments in this Update more closely align the measurement of inventory
in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). For public business entities,
the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this Update should be applied
prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. 

In
June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements.
ASU 2014-10 eliminates the distinction of a development stage entity and certain related disclosure requirements, including the
elimination of inception-to-date information on the statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity. The amendments
in ASU 2014-10 will be effective prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods
within those annual periods, however early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2014-10 during the quarter ended December
31, 2014, thereby no longer presenting or disclosing any information required by Topic 915.  

Management does not believe there would
be a material effect on the accompanying financial statements had any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards
been adopted in the current period. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK  

Not required. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES . 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures . We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized
that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and
procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. 

The Company s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, and as discussed in greater detail below, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, disclosure controls and procedures
were effective: 

to give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports that are file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and   

to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are file or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and our Treasurer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting.  There are no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

OF PROCEEDS  

Based on the completion of the asset
purchase agreement and share exchange agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk, on December 2, 2015, Premier Stock Transfer accepted
on behalf of EBC 4,033,863 Bayhawk shares and issued 4,033,863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014, as amended
(the  Asset Purchase Agreement ). EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration
statement and proxy statement on Form S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. 

The 4,033,863 shares exchanged per the
agreement along with the 436,000 shares that Evans Brewing Company held brings the total outstanding to 4,469,863. Bayhawk had
