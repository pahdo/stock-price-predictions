EXPLANATORY NOTE       As disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K of Viking Investments Group, Inc. (the  Company ) filed on November 14, 2016, on November 9, 2016, the Company engaged Turner, Stone   Company, L.L.P. (the  New Auditors ) as the Company s new independent registered public accounting firm. The New Auditors have been engaged to audit the Company s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, and review the Company s financial statements for the periods ending March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016, but they have not completed the audit or reviews.      As a result, this report is deficient because the unaudited financial statements contained in this report for the period ended September 30, 2016, have not been reviewed by an independent registered public accountant as required by rule 10-01(d) regulation S-X. Completion of the New Auditors  independent review of the Company s financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016, and the subsequent filing of an amendment to this report after the completion of that review, will make this report current. When the review is complete, the Company intends to file an amendment to this report which will include the required certifications of the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer as required by sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

     Table of Contents          VIKING INVESTMENTS GROUP, INC.     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     (Unaudited)    (Amounts expressed in US dollars)          Note 1.   Nature of Business and Going Concern       The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on May 3, 1989, as Sparta Ventures Corp. and remained inactive until June 27, 1998. After several name changes, the Company merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary, SinoCubate, Inc., which remained the surviving entity of the merger. SinoCubate, Inc. was formed in the State of Nevada on September 11, 2008. The merger resulted in a change of name of the Company from Synthenol Inc. to SinoCubate, Inc., and a change in the state of incorporation of the Company from Florida to Nevada. On June 13, 2012, the Company changed its name to Viking Investments Group, Inc., and the Company s ticker symbol was changed to  VKIN.      Prior to the first quarter of 2016, the Company s business plan consisted of two strategies: (a) identifying target companies that were undergoing or anticipating periods of rapid growth to provide advisory and consulting services, and (b) identifying investments in oil and gas properties for future exploration and development. In November of 2014, the Company entered into its first contract relative to oil and gas activities involving jointly controlled assets and related liabilities by purchasing an undivided 50% interest in the Joffre project located in Alberta, Canada, as explained in note 4.     Commencing with the first quarter of 2016, the Company determined that its singular business plan is to engage in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas properties. Consistent with its refocused efforts, on February 23, 2016, the Company closed on the acquisition of working interests in four leases with access to the mineral rights (oil and gas) concerning approximately 281 acres of property in Miami and Franklin Counties in eastern Kansas.     These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a net loss of $2,120,840 and $1,030,569 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company has accumulated a stockholders  deficit of ($294,351) as of September 30, 2016. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances; however, there is no assurance of additional funding being available. These unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recorded assets or liabilities that might be necessary should the Company have to curtail operations or be unable to continue in existence.      Note 2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies      a) Basis of Presentation     The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Viking Investments Group, Inc. ( Viking  or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in Viking s latest Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.                  8       
     Table of Contents         In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.     b) Basis of Consolidation     The financial statements presented herein reflect the consolidated financial results of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Viking Oil   Gas (Canada) ULC, a Canadian corporation formed on March 8, 2016. This subsidiary is intended to provide a base of operations in Canada, although at the time of this filing there has been no activity. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.      c) Use of Estimates     The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as certain financial statement disclosures. While management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates generally include those with respect to the amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves, the fair value of financial instruments, oil and gas depletion, asset retirement obligations, stock-based compensation, derivative liabilities and impairment of long-term investment.     d) Financial Instruments     ASC Topic 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 820-10,  Financial Instruments,  defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for other receivables, other payable, accrued liabilities, short term loan and due to director each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:                      Level 1: inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.                          Level 2: inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.                          Level 3: inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.         The changes in the Level 3 investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of an investment in the oil and gas properties acquired in February of 2016 in the amount of $2,170,250 minus depreciation of the recorded Asset Retirement Cost in the amount of $30,466 and depletion of $80,397.                  9       
     Table of Contents         Assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of September 30, 2016 are classified below based on the three fair value hierarchy described above:           Assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2015 are classified below based on the three fair value hierarchy described above:                 e) Cash       Cash includes bank deposits and cash on hand.     f) Accounts receivable     Accounts receivable consist of oil and gas receivables. The Company has classified these as short-term assets in the balance sheet because the Company expects repayment or recovery within the next 12 months. The Company evaluates these accounts receivable for collectability and, when necessary, records allowances for expected unrecoverable amounts. The Company deems all accounts receivable to be collectable, and has not recorded any allowance for doubtful accounts.      g) Prepaid equity-based compensation     Prepaid equity-based expenses represent amounts paid in advance through the issuance of restricted shares of stock, for future contractual benefits to be received. These expenses paid in advance are recorded as prepaid equity-based compensation as a component of  Stockholders  Equity  and then amortized to the statements of operations over the life of the contract using the straight-line method. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balances of the prepaid equity-based compensation were comprised of the following:           h) Oil and Gas Properties     The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and natural gas properties. Under this method of accounting, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, including directly related overhead costs, are capitalized. General and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred.     All capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves. Disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas, in which case the gain or loss is recognized to income. Investment in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs. If the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired, the amount of the impairment is included in loss from continuing operations before income taxes and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit-of-production method.            Amortization expense utilizing the unit-of-production method for the Company s oil and gas properties in both Canada and the United States for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:           i) Limitation on Capitalized Costs     Under the full-cost method of accounting, we are required, at the end of each fiscal quarter, to perform a test to determine the limit on the book value of our oil and natural gas properties (the  Ceiling  test). If the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, exceed the Ceiling, this excess or impairment is charged to expense and reflected as additional accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization or as credit to oil and natural gas properties. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the Ceiling. The Ceiling is defined as the sum of:      (a) the present value, discounted at 10 percent, and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, of 1) estimated future gross revenues from proved reserves, which is computed using oil and natural gas prices determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month hedging arrangements pursuant to SAB 103, less 2) estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, plus     (b) the cost of properties not being amortized (pursuant to Reg. S-X Rule 4-10 (c)(3)(ii); plus      (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized, net of      (d) the related tax effects related to the difference between the book and tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties.      j) Oil and Gas Reserves     Our proved oil and gas reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers. Reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof, including evaluations and extrapolations of well flow rates and reservoir pressure. Estimates by different engineers often vary sometimes significantly. In addition, physical factors such as the results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate, as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices, may justify revision of such estimates. Because proved reserves are required to be estimated using recent prices of the evaluation, estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices.           The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows are prepared using assumptions required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such assumptions include using a 10% rate. Changes in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the standardized measure. Accordingly, the standardized measure does not represent management s estimated current market value of proved reserves. At September 30, 2016, the Company s net book value of oil and natural gas properties did not exceed the ceiling amount calculated for the quarter.     k) Revenue Recognition     All revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service or sale is complete, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is derived from the sale of crude oil and natural gas. Revenue from crude oil and natural gas sales is recognized when the product is delivered to the purchaser and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company follows the  sales method  of accounting for oil and natural gas revenue, so it recognizes revenue on all natural gas or crude oil sold to purchasers.     l) Comprehensive Income     FASB ASC 220  Comprehensive Income,  establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated financial statements. The comprehensive income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,868,704 and the comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was ($1,972,177) respectively, and the comprehensive losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was ($367,331) and ($1,047,211) respectively.     m) Loss per Share     Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and, adjusted by any effects of warrants and options outstanding, if dilutive, that may add to the number of common shares during the period. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for options and warrants. Under this method,  in-the money  options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. At September 30, 2016, there were 4,062,500 common stock equivalents that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation.     n) Income Taxes     The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 ( ASC 740-10-25 ). Under ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets likely. The Company did not incur any material impact to its financial condition or results of operations due to the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company is subject to U.S federal jurisdiction income tax examinations for the tax years 2006 through 2014. In addition, the Company is subject to state and local income tax examinations for the tax years 2006 through 2015.     o) Stock-Based Compensation     The Company may issue stock options to employees and stock options or warrants to non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company has adopted ASC Topic 718 (formerly SFAS 123R),  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,  which establishes a fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans. In accordance with guidance now incorporated in ASC Topic 718, the cost of stock options and warrants issued to employees and non-employees is measured on the grant date based on the fair value. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The resulting amount is charged to expense on the straight-line basis over the period in which the Company expects to receive the benefit, which is generally the vesting period.           The fair value of stock warrants was determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option model requires management to make various estimates and assumptions, including expected term, expected volatility, risk-free rate, and dividend yield. The expected term represents the period of time that stock-based compensation awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on considerations including the vesting period, contractual term and anticipated employee exercise patterns. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in relation to the contractual life of stock-based compensation instrument. The dividend yield assumption is based on historical patterns and future expectations for the Company dividends.  The following table represents stock warrant activity as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:           p) Long-term Investment     Management determines the appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of purchase. Securities are classified held-to-maturity when the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost. Securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, the changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in Other Comprehensive Income, with the impairment losses, net of income taxes, charged to net income in the period in which it occurs.     The fair value of securities is based on quoted market prices. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale or held-for-maturity security below cost that is deemed to be other-then-temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value.     Impairments that are considered other-than-temporary are recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company considers various factors in reviewing impairments, including the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the Company s cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the Company s intent and ability to hold the investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.     As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no trading and held-to-maturity securities.           On September 9, 2014, the Company subscribed for 1,250,000 units of Tanager Energy Inc. ( Tanager ), a Canadian mining company listed on the Canadian TSXVenture Exchange as a Tier 2 company and trading under the stock symbol  TAN,  at a price of C$0.08 per unit. Each unit consists of one share of Tanager s common stock and one warrant to purchase one additional common share at a price of C$0.15 at any time until October 5, 2016. The warrants expire on October 5, 2016. The total price for the units subscribed for was C$101,247.47. The Company paid $92,000, which was equivalent to C$101,247.47 on September 11, 2014.     On October 6, 2014, the Company subscribed for an additional 2,187,500 units of Tanager at a price of C$0.08 per unit. Each unit consists of one share of Tanager s common stock to purchase one additional common share at a price of C$0.15 at any time until October 5, 2016. The warrants expire on October 5, 2016. The total price for the units subscribed for was C$175,000. The Company paid $155,444, which was equivalent to C$175,000 on October 17, 2014.     The Company s investment in Tanager is considered as  available-for-sale  securities, and an unrealized gain of $148,663 was recorded in other comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.     q) Impairment of long-lived assets     In accordance with ASC 360, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", the Company is required to review its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.     Assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for their identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The Company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the future estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, the Company measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. The estimation of fair value is generally determined by using the asset's expected future discounted cash flows or market value. The Company estimates fair value of the assets based on certain assumptions such as budgets, internal projections, and other available information as considered necessary. There is no impairment of long-lived assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     r) Foreign Currency Exchange     An entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates, normally that is the currency of the environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. Management's judgment is essential to determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators, such as cash flows, sales price and market, expenses, financing and inter-company transactions and arrangements. Functional currency of the parent company is the U.S. Dollar. The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. Dollar. The Company has oil and gas operations in Alberta, Canada in which the Canadian Dollar ( CAD  or  C$  herein) is the primary economic environment. The reporting currency of these consolidated financial statements is the U.S. Dollar.     For financial reporting purposes, the operational results of the Company's oil and gas operations in Canada are prepared using the CAD, and are translated in the Company s reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar. Revenue and expenses applicable to the oil and gas operations in Alberta, Canada are translated using average rates prevailing during each reporting period. Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders; equity when realized. There have been no settlement transactions that resulted in the recognition of a foreign currency exchange gain or loss during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.           s) Convertible Notes Payable     The Company accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible notes in accordance with ASC 815. ASC 815 generally requires companies to bifurcate conversion options embedded in convertible notes from their host instruments and to account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments.     The Company has evaluated the terms and conditions of the convertible note under the guidance of ASC 815. The conversion feature did not meet the definition of  indexed to a company s own stock  provided for in ASC 815 due to the down round protection feature. Therefore, the conversion feature requires bifurcation and liability classification. Additionally, the default put requires bifurcation because it is indexed to risks that are not associated with credit or interest risk. As a result, the compound embedded derivative comprises of (i) the embedded conversion feature and (i) the default put. Rather than bifurcating and recording the compound embedded derivative as a derivative liability, the Company elected to initially and subsequently measure the convertible note in its entirety at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in accordance with ASC 815-15-25-4.     t) Derivative Liability     We review the terms of convertible debt issues to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, including embedded conversion options, which are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments. In circumstances where the host instrument contains more than one embedded derivative instrument, including the conversion option, that is required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument.     Bifurcated embedded derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as non-operating income or expense. When the equity or convertible debt instruments contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds received are first allocated to the fair value of all the bifurcated derivative instruments. The remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the host instruments themselves, usually resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face value. The discount from the face value of the convertible debt, together with the stated interest on the instrument, is amortized over the life of the instrument through periodic charges to interest expense.      u) Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations     On July 1, 2015, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 143,  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting obligations and retirement costs related to the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. Among other things, SFAS No. 143 requires oil and gas companies to reflect decommissioning liabilities on the face of the balance sheet at fair value on a discounted basis. This statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the asset. Our asset retirement obligations consist of estimated costs for dismantlement, removal, site reclamation and similar activities associated with our oil and gas properties.      With the adoption of SFAS No. 143, an asset retirement obligation and the related asset retirement cost in the amount of $406,214 have been recorded. This asset retirement cost was determined and discounted to present value using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. After the initial recording, the liability is increased for the passage of time, with the increase being reflected as accretion expense in the statement of operations. Subsequent adjustments in the cost estimate are reflected in the liability and the amounts continue to be amortized over the useful life of the related long-lived asset.      Pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement associated with the oil and gas property acquisitions in the United States made during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Company has not incurred any additional asset retirement obligations as a result of this acquisition.           The following table describes the changes in the Company s asset retirement obligations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:            v) Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation     Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period data to the current presentations.      w) Recent Accounting Pronouncements     The Financial Accounting Standards Board and other entities issued new or modifications to, or interpretations of, existing accounting guidance during 2016. Management has carefully considered the new pronouncements that altered generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any other new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company s reported financial position or operations in the near term.     x) Subsequent events     The Company has evaluated all transactions through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued for subsequent event disclosure consideration.      Note 3. Related Party Transactions      During April 2015, the Company made an advance to Tanager Energy Inc., in conjunction with a joint investment in the second oil well of the Joffre Project. As of September 30, 2016, the balance owed by Tanager to the Company is $76,719, which is shown as  Other receivable   related party  on the balance sheet.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s Executive Chairman and Director, Tom Simeo did not accrue payroll and made no advances to the Company. The Company paid a total of $1,056 against prior advances by Mr. Simeo. Any accruals and advances do not bear interest, are unsecured and have no specific terms of repayment. As of September 30, 2016, the net amount due for prior accruals and expenses paid on behalf of the Company is $36,103. The Company has not imputed interest as the amount is deemed immaterial.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s CEO and Director, James Doris incurred expenses on behalf of, and made advances to the Company in the amount of $197,281 in order to provide the Company with funds to carry on its operations, and the Company made repayments of $55,000 against prior advances. These advances by Mr. Doris do not bear interest, are unsecured and have no specific terms of repayment. As of September 30, 2016, the amount due for expenses paid on behalf of the Company is $253,276. The Company has not imputed interest as the amount is deemed immaterial. Additionally, Mr. Doris made several loans to the Company totaling $466,836, all accruing interest at 12%, and payable on demand. As of September 30, 2016, the total amount due to Mr. Doris for advances and expenses paid on behalf of the Company and loans is $720,112. Accrued interest of $53,931 is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities at September 30, 2016.     On June 5, 2015, the Company authorized and approved the issuance of 2,000,000 and 872,871 restricted shares of common stock in settlement and cancellation of a total of $201,101 of amounts owed to directors at a cost basis of $0.07 per share.            Note 4.   Oil and Gas Properties      The following table summarizes the Company s oil and gas activities by classification and geographical cost center for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:            On November 3, 2014, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale, Petroleum and Natural Gas Conveyance Agreement (the  Agreement ), with Tanager Energy Inc., a Canadian corporation listed on the TSX Venture Exchange as a Tier 2 company and trading under the stock symbol  TAN  ( Tanager Energy ). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company was to receive a 50% working interest in the Joffre oil and gas property located in Alberta, Canada (the  Joffre Property ), and the Company was obligated to pay Tanager C$400,000 for the interest in the Joffre Property, with C$340,000 payable at closing.     On November 4, 2014, the Company closed the transaction by paying Tanager $302,367, with the balance of $52,801 (C$60,000) paid in January of 2015. Tanager owns the remaining 50% working interest in the property and operates and manages the property in accordance with an operating agreement pursuant to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Landman Operating Procedure. The proceeds were to be used by Tanager to complete and place on production the first of four suspended Devonian oil wells in the Joffre D-3 B oil pool (the  Joffre Project ). The Company s (and Tanager s) working interest in the Joffre Property will generally terminate when future production, if any, ceases (or in the case of the water disposal well on the Joffre Property, on the date that production ceases after 5 years has elapsed).     In April 2015, the Company advanced to Tanager Energy Inc., an additional $153,877 (C$190,000) as an investment in the second well in the Joffre D-3 oil pool. As the Company and Tanager each own 50% of each phase of this project, the Company has accounted for this transaction as an investment by the Company of $77,158 (C$95,270), with a loan receivable from Tanager of $76,719 (C$94,730).           On February 23, 2016, the Company closed on the acquisition of working interests in four leases with access to the mineral rights (oil and gas) concerning approximately 281 acres of property in Miami and Franklin Counties in eastern Kansas. This project produces oil from the Cherokee formation at a depth of approximately 600 feet. These leases offer the potential for several future drilling locations. The purchase includes an undivided interest in all oil and gas wells, equipment, fixtures and other personal property located upon the leased properties and used in connection with oil and gas operations upon the leases attributable to the working interests purchased by the Company. The names of the four leases and Viking s percentage ownership of the working interest of each lease is as follows:                  The effective date of the acquisitions is February 1, 2016, so the Company was entitled to net revenues from its share of production as of such date. As consideration for this transaction, the Company paid $1,350,000, plus 4,650,000 shares of common stock valued at $0.10 per share, or $465,000.      The Company also purchased a 100% working interest (a net revenue interest of 83%) in certain non-producing leases as follows: (i) three leases with access to the mineral rights (oil and gas) concerning approximately 270 acres of property in Miami and Franklin Counties in eastern Kansas; and (ii) 31 leases with access to the mineral rights (oil and gas) concerning approximately 5,500 acres of property in Cass and Bates Counties in Missouri. The purchase includes an undivided interest in all oil and gas wells, equipment, fixtures and other personal property located upon the leased properties and used in connection with oil and gas operations upon the leases attributable to the working interests purchased by Viking. As consideration for this transaction, Viking agreed to issue the vendors 5,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $0.10 per share, or $500,000.      The total purchase of these oil and gas interests is calculated as follows, and is included as an investment in Petroleum and Gas properties on the balance sheet at September 30, 2016:             Proforma condensed selected financial data for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as though this acquisition had taken place at January 1, 2015, are as follows:                         For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has included $49,232 and $135,334 of revenue providing $11,947 and $46,138 of net earnings in its consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition.      To facilitate these acquisitions, the Company borrowed $1,450,000 from private lenders pursuant to a 15% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the "Note"), arranged through a licensed broker/dealer, with the primary terms of the loan being as follows: (i)  Term    6 months; (ii)  Rate    15% per annum; (iii)  Security    1 st  ranking charge against company assets pursuant to a Security and Pledge Agreement (the "Security Agreement"); (iv)  Conversion    the lenders have a right to convert all or part of the note into common stock of Viking at a price of $0.15 per share, subject to certain ownership restrictions; and (v)  Warrants    the lenders were given an option to purchase, within the next 5 years, 4,062,500 shares of common stock of Viking at an initial exercise price of $0.20 per share pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Warrant. Viking's CEO and director, James Doris, also personally guaranteed repayment of the loan and granted the lenders a security interest in his assets.      Note 5.   Capital Stock and Additional Paid-in Capital      (a) Preferred Stock     The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Preferred Stock ), of which 50,000 have been designated as Series C Preferred Stock (the  Series C Preferred Stock ).     On October 3, 2012, the Company issued 28,092 shares of Series C Preferred Stock to Tom Simeo in exchange for the return of the equal amount of shares of common stock, owned by Tom Simeo, deposited in a brokerage account, to the Company for cancellation. On or about September 1, 2015, Tom Simeo instructed the Company s Stock Transfer Agent, VStock Transfer LLC, to cancel stock certificate number 3032, representing 28,092 shares of common stock, in consideration for the missing 28,092 shares of common stock. Neither the common stock, nor the preferred stock, were assessed any value.     Each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to two thousand (2,000) votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time on or after the date that Preferred Stock has been issued ( Distribution Date) declare or pay any dividend on common stock payable in shares of common stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of common stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of common stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction of the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.     Each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share, at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock, into one share of fully paid and non-assessable common stock (the  Conversion Rate ).     On July 16, 2015, Tom Simeo, Executive Chairman, and a director of the Company, who owned 28,092 shares of the Company s Series C Preferred Stock (the  Shares ), transferred 50% (14,046) of the Shares to James A. Doris, President, CEO and a director of the Company in consideration of the purchase price of $10,000, paid from the personal funds of Mr. Doris. Mr. Simeo retained 14,046 shares of the Company s Series C Preferred Stock, and no other shares of Series C Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding. Since each of the preferred shares entitles the voter of 2,000 votes per share, or 70,230,000 each, Mr. Simeo and Mr. Doris effectively control the Company jointly, neither of them solely controls the Company, and the transfer of the preferred shares constituted a change of control of the Company.     (b) Common Stock     The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share.     In May 2015, the Company authorized and approved the issuance of 720,000 shares of its common stock in conjunction with a six month consulting agreement, at a cost basis of $0.15 per share, the current fair market value at the time of the agreement.             On August 3, 2015, the Company issued 421,571 restricted shares of common stock in settlement and cancellation of $30,000 of accrued payroll, and 2,000,000 and 872,871 restricted shares of common stock in settlement and cancellation of a total of $201,101 of amounts owed to directors, at a cost basis of $0.07 per share.     On November 18, 2015, the Company issued 1,000,000 restricted shares of its common stock in conjunction with a one-year consulting agreement, at a cost of $0.165 per share, the current fair market value at the time of agreement.     On November 23, 2015, a convertible note holder elected to convert $4,200 of the principal amount of the convertible note dated May 22, 2015, into 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock in accordance with the convertible note agreement.      On December 1, 2015, a convertible note holder elected to convert $8,400 of the principal amount of the convertible note dated May 22, 2015, into 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock in accordance with the convertible note agreement.      On December 24, 2015, a convertible note holder elected to convert $8,400 of the principal amount of the convertible note dated May 22, 2015, into 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock in accordance with the convertible note agreement.      On January 12, 2016, the Company issued 300,926 common shares upon the conversion of convertible debt in the amount of $10,111.     On March 16, 2016, the Company issued 1,000,000 common shares for services, valued at $102,500.     As of February 1, 2016, the Company issued 9,650,000 common shares as part of the consideration for the acquisition of the oil and gas investment made at that time.      On March 21, 2016, the Company executed two one-year consulting agreements requiring the issuance of 2,000,000 common shares for each contract. Both of these contracts were terminated, the shares were returned to the Company, and were cancelled in August 2016.     On March 21, 2016, the Company executed a one-year advisory services agreement requiring the issuance of 1,000,000 common shares for the contract. The shares are to be issued as 375,002 upon execution of the contract, with 56,818 shares being issued at the beginning of each month for the remaining eleven months. The Company has determined to account for all 1,000,000 common shares valued at $0.16 per share upon execution of the agreement as prepaid equity-based compensation to be amortized over the term of the contract. As of September 30, 2016, 284,090 shares remain unissued, and are accounted for as issuable.      As of April 29, 2016, the Company, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, sold 1,250,000 shares of its common stock at $0.15 per share.      On September 28, 2016, the Company issued 2,400,000 common shares, at the current market value of $288,000 as a portion of the purchase price of additional oil and gas properties acquired on October 4, 2016. This amount is included as a deposit in other assets as of September 30, 2016.     During September 2016, the Company negotiated the payment of certain convertible notes, and committed to the issuance of 375,000 common shares at the current market value of $52,500 as additional interest. These shares have not been issued as of the date of this report, and are accounted for as issuable at September 30, 2016.     As of September 30, 2016, the Company, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, sold $1,337,500 shares of its common stock at $0.15 per share.     (c) Prepaid Equity-Based Compensation     From time to time, the Company has issued shares of restricted common stock to various unrelated parties as prepayment for certain services to be rendered over a term of one year from the date of the agreement. The Company has recorded the fair value of the shares at the date of the agreement as prepaid equity-based compensation, and then amortizes this amount to stock based compensation ratably over the life of the agreements. As of September 30, 2016, the prepaid equity-based compensation balance is $97,095.              Note   6  .

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not borrowed any money under this agreement.         Note 9.   Subsequent Events      The Company has evaluated subsequent events from September 30, 2016, through the date of filing this report, and determined there are no other items to disclose other than those disclosed below:     On October 4, 2016, the Company closed on the purchase of working interests in various oil and gas leases in Eastern Kansas. Simultaneously, to facilitate the purchase, the Company closed on its initial funding from Crossfirst Bank under the September 30, 2016 Revolver Agreement in the amount of $1,800,000.             SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION   OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION   (unaudited)      As of September 30, 2016, the Company has two separate oil and gas production projects as follows:                  (1)  The Company has a 50% undivided interest in an oil property located approximately ten miles northeast of Red Deer, Alberta in Canada. The property consists of one oil well producing from the Leduc Formation, three suspended oil wells, one abandoned oil well, and a suspended water injector.                                The Lake Devonian Leduc formation is represented by large barrier reef and smaller pinnacle reef bioherms which grew on the Cooking Lake platform carbonates. Trending northeast to southwest, the limestones and dolostones of the Leduc/Cooking Lake Formations were deposited on the bathymetric highs of the Lake Devonian seas. Hydrocarbons are trapped by lateral stratigraphic pinch out of these dolomitic carbonates into deeper water shale sediments.      Proved developed producing reserves have been assigned to the first producing oil well. The well was re-activated and came on production in January 2015. The well has produced sporadically since January averaging seven to ten days of production per month. Production forecasts have taken into account this workover and reflect the increase of reserves in the total proved and proved plus probable cases.      The Company plans on installing a pumpjack to the well in early 2016 to enhance performance. The three suspended wells are scheduled to be re-activated in 2016. Proved reserves are assigned to these wells as the wells have demonstrated production over a number of years.                       (2)  The Company has various working interests in four leases with access to the mineral rights (oil and gas) concerning approximately 281 acres of property in Miami and Franklin Counties in eastern Kansas. This project produces oil from the Cherokee formation at a depth of approximately 600 feet. These leases offer the potential for several future drilling locations.                               The Company also purchased a 100% working interest (a net revenue interest of 83%) in certain non-producing leases as follows: (i) three leases with access to the mineral rights (oil and gas) concerning approximately 270 acres of property in Miami and Franklin Counties in eastern Kansas; and (ii) 31 leases with access to the mineral rights (oil and gas) concerning approximately 5,500 acres of property in Cass and Bates Counties in Missouri.          Results of Operations     The results of operations for petroleum and natural gas production for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, consist of both the 50% undivided interest in the Joffre oil and gas property located in Alberta, Canada as well as the various working interests in the four leases in eastern Kansas, as follows:                                                Petroleum and Natural Gas Exploration and Production Costs      The amounts shown as net capitalized costs for petroleum and natural gas rights of $2,863,046 and $803,660 consist of the initial investment to acquire the undivided interest in the Joffre Project, as well as additional licensing costs at that location, as well as the investment made during the first quarter of this year, to acquire the oil and gas properties in Kansas. The Company does not incur any production or exploratory costs as the entire project is operated through a subcontract relationship.      Petroleum and Natural Gas Reserves   Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible   from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations   prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire. The detailed reserve information and production forecasts for the Joffre project in Alberta, Canada were presented in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and is incorporated herein.      The following information is an estimate of the proved oil reserve, and the associated economic values of those certain properties in Franklin, Linn and Miami counties, Kansas, acquired by the Company in February 2016      The following tables summarize projected revenues, expenses and discounted cash flows:             Proved, Developed Producing Reserves       The Proved, Developed Producing (PDP) reserves were determined by extrapolation of the lease production decline curves. Waterflood reserves are classified as PDP on these leases by virtue of the successful past operations in these, and regional analogous, reservoirs. Developed reserves are those expected to be recovered from existing wells (including reserves behind pipe). Improved recovery reserves are considered developed only after the necessary equipment has been installed, or when the costs to do so are relatively minor. The gross PDP reserves (November 1, 2015) of the subject leases are:             The following table summarizes PDP projected revenues, expenses and discounted cash flows for the HAHN lease as of November 1, 2015:                   The following table summarizes PDP projected revenues, expenses and discounted cash flows for the JOHNSTON lease as of November 1, 2015:                     The following table summarizes PDP projected revenues, expenses and discounted cash flows for the WILSON, EAST lease as of November 1, 2015:                  The following table summarizes PDP projected revenues, expenses and discounted cash flows for the WILSON, WEST lease as of November 1, 2015:                     Proved Undeveloped Reserves       The Proved Undeveloped (PUD) reserves were determined by analogy to existing wells on the evaluated leases, or to similar production in the area. Waterflood reserves are included. Undeveloped reserves are those expected to be recovered: (1) from new wells on undrilled acreage, (2) from deepening existing wells to a different reservoir, or (3) where a relatively large expenditure is required to (a) recomplete an existing well or (b) install production or transportation facilities for primary or improved recovery projects. The gross PUD reserves (November 1, 2015) of the subject leases are:             The following table summarizes PUD projected revenues, expenses and discounted cash flows for the HAHN lease as of November 1, 2015:                    The following table summarizes PUD projected revenues, expenses and discounted cash flows for the JOHNSTON lease as of November 1, 2015:                    The following table summarizes PUD projected revenues, expenses and discounted cash flows for the WILSON, EAST lease as of November 1, 2015:                   The following table summarizes PUD projected revenues, expenses and discounted cash flows for the WILSON, WEST lease as of November 1, 2015:                    ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-Q. In preparing the management s discussion and analysis, the registrant presumes that you have read or have access to the discussion and analysis for the preceding fiscal year.      SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT S     This document includes  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or the Reform Act.

The Company s future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and inherent risks and uncertainties.      PLAN OF OPERATIONS       Overview      Prior to the first quarter of 2016, the Company s business plan consisted of two strategies: (a) identifying target companies that were undergoing or anticipating periods of rapid growth to provide advisory and consulting services, and (b) identifying investments in oil and gas properties for future exploration and development. In November of 2014, the Company entered into its first contract relative to oil and gas activities involving jointly controlled assets and related liabilities by purchasing an undivided 50% interest in the Joffre project located in Alberta, Canada, as explained in note 4.     Commencing with the first quarter of 2016, the Company has determined that its singular business plan is to engage in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas properties. Consistent with its refocused efforts, on February 23, 2016, the Company closed on the acquisition of working interests in four leases with access to the mineral rights (oil and gas) concerning approximately 281 acres of property in Miami and Franklin Counties in eastern Kansas.      Going Concern Qualification      The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances; however there is no assurance of additional funding being available.            RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS      The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operation of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.      Liquidity and Capital Resources      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $88,625 and $30,585 in cash holdings, respectively.       Three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015       Revenue      The Company had gross revenues of $105,426 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing its share of revenue from its 50% undivided interest in the Joffre Property as well as the new revenues from the investment in the oil properties in Kansas, as compared to $32,425 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which only represented revenue from the Joffre Property. This revenue from the Joffre Property comes from the first two oil wells in the project which began producing during April of 2015, and the revenue from the Kansas property comes from four leases.       Expenses      The Company s operating expenses increased by $229,982 to $451,093 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, from $221,111 in the corresponding period in 2015. The increase was mainly due to stock based compensation of $172,219 as well as depreciation, depletion and amortization costs associated with ownership of oil and gas properties, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.      Other Income and Expense       The Company s interest expense increased by $404,306 to $542,107 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $137,801 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This large increase in interest cost is reflective of the increase in debt associated with the Company s growth strategy relative to oil and gas property acquisitions. This expense item is expected to go down as the Company anticipates replacing debt with unfavorable terms. The Company also had a gain on derivatives of $2,765,013 as compared to a derivative loss of $36,424 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.       Net Loss      The Company incurred a net comprehensive income of $1,873,845 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared with a net comprehensive loss of $367,331 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase in Net comprehensive income was mainly due to the items referred to in the analysis of operating expenses and other income.             Nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015       Revenue      The Company had gross revenues of $232,013 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing its share of revenue from its 50% undivided interest in the Joffre Property as well as the new revenues from the investment in the oil properties in Kansas, as compared to $64,448 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which only represented revenue from the Joffre project.      Expenses      The Company s operating expenses increased by $716,312 to $1,290,116 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, from $573,804 in the corresponding period in 2015. The increase was mainly due to stock based compensation of $578,363 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 108,000 for the prior year. Additionally is the increase in both lease operating costs and depletion expense as production from the wells increases.      Other Income and Expense       The Company s interest expense increased by $1,770,313 to $1,966,015 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $195,702 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This large increase in interest cost is reflective of the increase in debt associated with the Company s growth strategy relative to oil and gas property acquisitions, which also created a large amortization of debt discount. This expense item is expected to go down as the Company anticipates replacing debt with unfavorable terms. The Company also had a gain on the settlement of debt associated with professional services in the amount of $75,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and a gain on derivatives of $833,418 as compared to a derivative gain of $77,682 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.      Net Loss      The Company incurred a net comprehensive loss of $1,967,037 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared with a net comprehensive loss of $1,047,211 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net loss was mainly due to the items referred to in the analysis of operating expenses and other income.      CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES      The Company has adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America in the preparation of the Company s financial statements which requires it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.     Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future, the final results may ultimately differ from actual results. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions, which have a material impact on the Company s financial condition and results. Management believes its critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the presentation of the Company s financial statements. The Company s critical accounting policies include debt management and accounting for stock-based compensation. The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as  special purpose entities.
