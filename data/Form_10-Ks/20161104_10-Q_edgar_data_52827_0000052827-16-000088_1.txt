1. 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
     Basis of Presentation 
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Rayonier Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Rayonier  or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). In the opinion of management, these financial statements and notes reflect all adjustments (all of which are normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the periods presented. These statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the SEC (the  2015 Form 10-K ). 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain 2015 amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation, including changes in balance sheet presentation. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company reclassified capitalized debt costs related to non-revolving debt from Other Assets to Long Term Debt as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-50) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   which is required to be applied on a retrospective basis. This reclassification is reflected in the September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheets. A corresponding change has also been made to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for both periods presented.  
  New Accounting Standards 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which addresses the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. This Update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. ASU No. 2016-15 is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented beginning in the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This update simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Rayonier intends to adopt ASU No. 2016-09 in the Company s first quarter 2017 Form 10-Q. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships  , which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. ASU No. 2016-05 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Rayonier intends to adopt ASU No. 2016-05 in the Company s first quarter 2017 Form 10-Q and does not expect it will have an impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets related to the rights and obligations created by those leases. ASU No. 2016-02 also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. ASU No. 2016-02 is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented beginning in the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands unless otherwise stated) 

In May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) jointly issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede current revenue recognition guidance. The guidance provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized and will require enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity s contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date  . ASU No. 2015-14 provides a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new standard, with an option for organizations to adopt early based on the original effective date.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  . The update clarifies the guidance for identifying performance obligations. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU. No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . The update clarifies the guidance for assessing collectibility, presenting sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers, noncash consideration, contract modifications at transition, completed contracts at transition and disclosing the accounting change in the period of adoption. This standard will be effective for Rayonier beginning January 1, 2018 and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements and has completed a preliminary analysis of the specific impacts to our Southern Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber, New Zealand Timber and Real Estate segments. 
    
  Subsequent Events 
  Disposition of 37,000 acres of Gulf states timberland 
  On October 21, 2016, the Company completed   two   separate transactions for the sale of   37,000   acres of timberland in Alabama and Mississippi for   $77.8 million  . The basis in these properties were classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016. See   Note 18       Assets Held For Sale   for additional information. 

2. 
    TIMBERLAND ACQUISITION 
     Menasha Acquisition 
  The Company and Forest Investment Associates ( FIA ) formed Olympus Acquisition Company ( Olympus ) to acquire all the outstanding common stock of Menasha Forest Products Corporation ( Menasha ), a privately held company with approximately   132,000   acres of timberland located in Oregon and Washington (the  Menasha Acquisition ).  
  On May 10, 2016 (the  acquisition date ), essentially all of the net assets of Olympus were distributed to the Company and FIA, resulting in the Company owning an identified portfolio of   61,000   acres of the former Menasha timberland for a final purchase price of approximately   $263 million  .  
  Business Combination Accounting 
  The distribution of net assets from Olympus to Rayonier has been accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, the consideration paid by the Company has been recorded to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. In determining the fair value of the timberlands, the Company utilized valuation methodologies including a discounted cash flow analysis. A sales comparison approach was utilized to determine the fair market value of property, plant and equipment. The carrying values for current assets and liabilities were deemed to approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Rayonier s share of acquisition costs of   $1.3 million   is included in  Other operating income, net.  
  As of the filing date of this report, the Company has not completed its final accounting related to this acquisition. As a result, preliminary estimates have been recorded and are subject to change. Any necessary adjustments from the preliminary estimates will be finalized as soon as practicable but within one year from the date of acquisition. Measurement period adjustments will be recorded in the period in which they are determined, as if they had been completed at the acquisition date.

  (Dollar amounts in thousands unless otherwise stated) 

The Company is currently in the process of finalizing its valuations related to the following: Timber and timberlands, Property, plant and equipment, Other current and non-current assets and Other current and non-current liabilities.  
  The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:             

(a) 
    Timber and timberlands include   $0.8 million   of seeds and seedlings. 
     Operating Results and Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information 
  The net income effect resulting from the Menasha acquisition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is impracticable to determine, as the Company immediately integrated Menasha into its ongoing operations. Additionally, pro forma information has not been provided, as the portion of Menasha acquired was a component of a larger legal entity and separate historical financial statements were not prepared. Since stand-alone financial information prior to the acquisition was not readily available, compilation of such data is impracticable. 
  Washington Disposition 
  In May 2016, the Company completed a disposition of approximately   55,000   acres located in Washington to FIA (the  Washington disposition ) for a sale price of approximately   $130 million  . The proceeds received from the disposition were used to finance a portion of the Menasha Acquisition. The remainder of the acquisition was financed by entering into an incremental term loan agreement with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of Farm Credit institutions to provide a   10  -year,   $300 million   incremental term loan. See   Note 5       Debt   for additional information. 

3. 
    JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENT 
     Matariki Forestry Group 
  On March 3, 2016, the Company made a capital contribution into Matariki Forestry Group (the "New Zealand JV"), a joint venture that owns or leases approximately   0.4 million   legal acres of New Zealand timberlands, for the purpose of refinancing approximately NZ  $235 million   of New Zealand JV indebtedness and paying related fees and expenses, including the costs of settling out-of-the-money interest rate swaps. As a result of the capital contribution, the Company's ownership interest in the New Zealand JV increased from   65%   to   77%  . As a result of the increase in ownership percentage, the pro-rata share of the New Zealand JV s unrealized foreign currency and cash flow hedge losses were reallocated between the Company and the noncontrolling interest. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810-10-45-24, this reallocation resulted in a reduction to the common share balance. The Company maintains a controlling financial interest in the New Zealand JV and, accordingly, consolidates the New Zealand JV s Balance Sheet and results of operations. The portions of the consolidated financial position and results of operations attributable to the New Zealand JV s   23%   noncontrolling interest are shown separately within the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Shareholders  Equity. Rayonier New Zealand Limited ( RNZ ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rayonier Inc., serves as the manager of the New Zealand JV.

    SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION 
     Sales between operating segments are made based on estimated fair market value and intercompany sales, purchases and profits (losses) are eliminated in consolidation. The Company evaluates financial performance based on segment operating income and Adjusted EBITDA. Asset information is not reported by segment, as the Company does not produce asset information by segment internally. 
  Operating income as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss) is equal to segment income. Certain income (loss) items in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss) are not allocated to segments. These items, which include gains (losses) from certain asset dispositions, interest income (expense), miscellaneous income (expense) and income tax (expense) benefit, are not considered by management to be part of segment operations and are included under  Corporate and other  or  unallocated interest expense and other.  
  The following tables summarize the segment information for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Principal payments due during the next five years and thereafter are as follows: 

Incremental Term Loan Agreement 
  On April 28, 2016, the Company entered into an incremental term loan agreement with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of Farm Credit institutions to provide a   10  -year,   $300 million   incremental term loan. Proceeds from the term loan were used to fund Rayonier s portion of the Menasha acquisition net of the proceeds received from the Washington disposition, to repay approximately   $105 million   outstanding on the Company s revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The Company has entered into interest rate swap transactions to fix the cost of the term loan over its 10-year term. The periodic interest rate on the incremental term loan agreement is LIBOR plus   1.900%  . The Company receives annual patronage payments, which are profit distributions made by a cooperative to its member-users based on the quantity or value of business done with the member-user. The Company estimates the effective interest rate for the third quarter was approximately   2.8%   after consideration of the estimated patronage payments and interest rate swaps. 
  Term Credit Agreement 
  On August 5, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of Farm Credit institutions and other commercial banks to provide   $550 million   of new credit facilities, including a   five  -year   $200 million   unsecured revolving credit facility (see below) and a   nine  -year   $350 million   term loan facility. The Company has entered into interest rate swap transactions to fix the cost of the term loan facility over its   nine  -year term. The periodic interest rate on the term credit agreement is LIBOR plus   1.625%  . The Company estimates the effective interest rate for the third quarter was approximately   3.3%   after consideration of the estimated patronage payments and interest rate swaps.  
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  In August 2015, the Company entered into a   five  -year   $200 million   unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing the previous   $200 million   revolving credit facility and   $100 million   farm credit facility, which were scheduled to expire in April 2016 and December 2019, respectively. The periodic interest rate on the revolving credit facility is LIBOR plus   1.250%  , with an unused commitment fee of   0.175%  .  
  Net borrowings of $  25.0 million   were made in the third quarter of 2016 on the revolving credit facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had available borrowings of $  169.5 million   under the revolving credit facility, net of   $5.5 million   to secure its outstanding letters of credit. 
  Joint Venture Debt 
  On March 3, 2016, the Company used proceeds from the term loan facility to fund a capital contribution into the New Zealand JV. The New Zealand JV in turn used the proceeds for full repayment of the outstanding amount of   $155 million   under its Tranche A credit facility.  
  In June 2016, the New Zealand JV entered into a   12  -month NZ  $20.0 million   working capital facility and an   18  -month NZ  $20.0 million   working capital facility, replacing the previous NZ  $40.0 million   facility that expired in June 2016.

  (Unaudited) 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands unless otherwise stated) 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the New Zealand JV made additional borrowings and repayments of   $146.1 million   on the facility. Draws totaling   $29.2 million   remain available on the working capital facilities at   September 30, 2016  . In addition, the New Zealand JV paid   $2.6 million   of its shareholder loan held with the non-controlling interest party during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Changes in exchange rates increased debt on a U.S. dollar basis for its shareholder loan by   $1.4 million  .  
  Debt Covenants 
  In connection with the Company s   $350 million   term credit agreement,   $300 million   incremental term loan agreement and   $200 million   revolving credit facility, customary covenants must be met, the most significant of which include interest coverage and leverage ratios. In addition to these financial covenants, the mortgage notes, senior notes, term credit agreement, incremental term loan agreement and revolving credit facility include customary covenants that limit the incurrence of debt and the disposition of assets, among others. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants. 

6. 
    HIGHER AND BETTER USE TIMBERLANDS AND REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS 
       
  Rayonier continuously assesses potential alternative uses of its timberlands, as some properties may become more valuable for development, residential, recreation or other purposes. The Company periodically transfers, via a sale or contribution from the real estate investment trust ( REIT ) entities to taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRS ), higher and better use ( HBU ) timberlands to enable land-use entitlement, development or marketing activities. The Company also acquires HBU properties in connection with timberland acquisitions. These properties are managed as timberlands until sold or developed. While the majority of HBU sales involve rural and recreational land, the Company also selectively pursues various land-use entitlements on certain properties for residential, commercial and industrial development in order to enhance the long-term value of such properties. For selected development properties, Rayonier also invests in targeted infrastructure improvements, such as roadways and utilities, to accelerate the marketability and improve the value of such properties. 
    
  An analysis of higher and better use timberlands and real estate development costs from December 31, 2015 to   September 30, 2016   is shown below: 

(a) 
    The current portion of Higher and Better Use Timberlands and Real Estate Development Investments is recorded in Inventory. See   Note 16       Inventory   for additional information. 
              (b) 
    Capitalized real estate development investments includes   $0.1 million   of capitalized interest.

7. 
    COMMITMENTS 
     The Company leases certain buildings, machinery, and equipment under various operating leases. The Company also has long-term lease agreements on certain timberlands in the Southern U.S. and New Zealand. U.S. leases typically have initial terms of approximately   30   to   65   years, with renewal provisions in some cases. New Zealand timberland lease terms range between   30   and   99   years. Such leases are generally non-cancellable and require minimum annual rental payments. 
  At September 30, 2016, the future minimum payments under non-cancellable operating and timberland leases were as follows: 

(a) 
    The majority of timberland leases are subject to increases or decreases based on either the Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index or market rates. 
              (b) 
    Commitments include payments expected to be made on derivative financial instruments (foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps), standby letters of credit fees for industrial revenue bonds and construction of the Company s office building. 
              (c) 
    Includes   20 years   of future minimum payments for perpetual Crown Forest Licenses ( CFL ). A CFL consists of a license to use public or government owned land to operate a commercial forest. The CFL's extend indefinitely and may only be terminated upon a   35  -year termination notice from the government. If no termination notice is given, the CFLs renew automatically each year for a   one  -year term. As of   September 30, 2016  , the New Zealand JV has   four   CFL s under termination notice, terminating in 2034,   two   in 2044 and 2049 as well as   two   fixed-term CFL s expiring in 2062. The annual license fee is determined based on current market rental value, with triennial rent reviews.

    INCOME TAXES 
     The operations conducted by the Company s REIT entities are generally not subject to U.S. federal and state income tax. The New Zealand JV is subject to corporate level tax in New Zealand. Non-REIT qualifying operations are conducted by the Company s TRS. The primary businesses performed in Rayonier s TRS include log trading and certain real estate activities, such as the sale and entitlement of development HBU properties. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The Company s effective tax rate is below the   35.0%   U.S. statutory rate due to tax benefits associated with being a REIT. The income tax expense (benefit) for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are principally related to the New Zealand JV.  
  The table below reconciles the U.S. statutory rate to the Company s effective tax rate for each period presented:

    CONTINGENCIES  
       
  Following the Company s November 10, 2014 earnings release and filing of the restated interim financial statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014 (the  November 2014 Announcement ), shareholders of the Company filed   five   putative class actions against the Company and Paul G. Boynton, Hans E. Vanden Noort, David L. Nunes, and H. Edwin Kiker arising from circumstances described in the November 2014 Announcement, entitled respectively: 

Lake Worth Firefighters  Pension Trust Fund v. Rayonier Inc. et al  , Civil Action No. 3:14-cv-01403, filed November 13, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida; 

Brown v. Rayonier Inc. et al  , Civil Action No. 1:14-cv-08986, initially filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and later transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida and assigned as Civil Action No. 3:14-cv-01474.  
          
  On January 9, 2015, the   five   securities actions were consolidated into   one   putative class action entitled   In re Rayonier Inc. Securities Litigation  , Case No. 3:14-cv-01395-TJC-JBT, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants made false and/or misleading statements in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiffs sought unspecified monetary damages and attorneys  fees and costs.   Two   shareholders, the Pension Trust Fund for Operating Engineers and the Lake Worth Firefighters  Pension Trust Fund moved for appointment as lead plaintiff on January 12, 2015, which was granted on February 25, 2015. On April 7, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint (the  Consolidated Complaint ). In the Consolidated Complaint, plaintiffs added allegations as to and added as a defendant N. Lynn Wilson, a former officer of Rayonier. With the filing of the Consolidated Complaint, David L. Nunes and H. Edwin Kiker were dropped from the case as defendants. Defendants timely filed Motions to Dismiss the Consolidated Complaint on May 15, 2015.     After oral argument on Defendants' motions on August 25, 2015, the Court dismissed the Consolidated Complaint without prejudice, allowing plaintiffs leave to refile. Plaintiffs filed the Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint (the  Amended Complaint ) on September 25, 2015, which continued to assert claims against the Company, as well as Ms. Wilson and Messrs. Boynton and Vanden Noort. Defendants timely filed Motions to Dismiss the Amended Complaint on October 26, 2015. The court denied those motions on May 20, 2016. The case is now in the discovery phase. At this preliminary stage, the Company cannot determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood a material loss has been incurred nor can the range of any such loss be estimated. 
    
  On November 26, 2014, December 29, 2014, January 26, 2015, February 13, 2015, and May 12, 2015, the Company received separate letters from shareholders requesting that the Company investigate or pursue derivative claims against certain officers and directors related to the November 2014 Announcement. Although these demands do not identify any claims against the Company, the Company has certain obligations to advance expenses and provide indemnification to certain current and former officers and directors of the Company. The Company has also incurred expenses as a result of costs arising from the investigation of the claims alleged in the various demands. At this preliminary stage, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted, nor can the range of potential expenses the Company may incur as a result of the obligations identified above be estimated. 
    
  The Company has also been named as a defendant in various other lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business. While the Company has procured reasonable and customary insurance covering risks normally occurring in connection with its businesses, it has in certain cases retained some risk through the operation of self-insurance, primarily in the areas of workers  compensation, property insurance and general liability. These pending lawsuits and claims, either individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flow.

The Company provides financial guarantees as required by creditors, insurance programs, and various governmental agencies.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the following financial guarantees were outstanding: 

(a) 
    Approximately   $15 million   of the standby letters of credit serve as credit support for industrial revenue bonds. Approximately   $3.8 million   of the standby letters of credit serve as credit support for infrastructure at the Company s Wildlight development project. The remaining letters of credit support various insurance related agreements, primarily workers  compensation. These letters of credit will expire at   various dates during 2016 and 2017   and will be renewed as required. 
              (b) 
    In conjunction with a timberland sale and note monetization in 2004, the Company issued a make-whole agreement pursuant to which it guaranteed   $2.3 million   of obligations of a special-purpose entity that was established to complete the monetization. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company has a   de minimis liability   to reflect the fair market value of its obligation to perform under the make-whole agreement. 
              (c) 
    Rayonier issues surety bonds primarily to secure timber harvesting obligations in the State of Washington and to provide collateral for the Company s workers  compensation self-insurance program in that state.

    EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 
     The following table provides details of the calculations of basic and diluted earnings per common share: 

(a)    Rayonier did not issue additional shares upon maturity of the Senior Exchangeable Notes due August 2015 (the  2015  
  Notes ) due to offsetting hedges. ASC 260,   Earnings Per Share   required the assumed conversion of the 2015 Notes to be included in dilutive shares if the average stock price for the period exceeded the strike price, while the conversion of the hedges was excluded since they were anti-dilutive. The full dilutive effect of the 2015 Notes was included for the prior period presented. 
  Rayonier did not distribute additional shares upon the February 2016 maturity of the warrants sold in conjunction with the 2015 Notes as the stock price did not exceed   $28.11   per share. The warrants were not dilutive for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 as the average stock price for the periods the warrants were outstanding did not exceed the strike price.

    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
     The Company is exposed to market risk related to potential fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the financial impact of exposure to these risks.  
  Accounting for derivative financial instruments is governed by ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , ( ASC 815 ). In accordance with ASC 815, the Company records its derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the instruments  fair value are accounted for based on their intended use. Gains and losses on derivatives that are designated and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction materializes. Gains and losses on derivatives that are designated and qualify for net investment hedge accounting are recorded as a component of AOCI and will not be reclassified into earnings until the Company s investment in its New Zealand operations is partially or completely liquidated. The ineffective portion of any hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and those which are no longer effective as hedging instruments, are recognized immediately in earnings. The Company s hedge ineffectiveness was de minimis for all periods presented.  
  Foreign Currency Exchange and Option Contracts 
  The functional currency of Rayonier s wholly owned subsidiary, Rayonier New Zealand Limited, and the New Zealand JV is the New Zealand dollar. The New Zealand JV is exposed to foreign currency risk on export sales and ocean freight payments which are mainly denominated in U.S. dollars. The New Zealand JV typically hedges   35%   to   90%   of its estimated foreign currency exposure with respect to the following three months forecasted sales and purchases,   25%   to   75%   of forecasted sales and purchases for the forward   three   to   12   months and up to   50%   of the forward   12   to   18   months. Foreign currency exposure from the New Zealand JV s trading operations is typically hedged based on the following three months forecasted sales and purchases. As of   September 30, 2016  , foreign currency exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts had maturity dates through November 2017. 
  Foreign currency exchange and option contracts hedging foreign currency risk on export sales and ocean freight payments qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. The fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts is determined by a mark-to-market valuation which estimates fair value by discounting the difference between the contracted forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate. The fair value of foreign currency option contracts is based on a mark-to-market calculation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  
  The Company may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance or at the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously accumulated in other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings.  
  In August 2015, the Company entered into foreign currency option contracts (notional amount of   $332 million  ) to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when translating the New Zealand JV s balance sheet to U.S. dollars. These contracts hedged a portion of the Company s net investment in New Zealand and qualified as a net investment hedge. The fair value of these contracts was determined by a mark-to-market valuation, which estimates fair value by discounting the difference between the contracted forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate. The hedges qualified for hedge accounting whereby fluctuations in fair market value during the life of the hedge are recorded in AOCI and remain there permanently unless a partial or full liquidation of the investment is made. At each reporting period, the Company reviews the hedges for ineffectiveness. Ineffectiveness can occur when changes to the investment or the hedged instrument are made such that the risk of foreign exchange movements are no longer mitigated by the hedging instrument. At that time, the amount related to the ineffectiveness of the hedge is recorded into earnings. The Company did not have any ineffectiveness during the life of the hedges. The foreign currency option contracts matured on February 3, 2016. 
  On February 1, 2016, the Company entered into foreign currency option contracts (notional amounts of   $159.7 million   and   $154.6 million  ) to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates when funding the capital contribution to the New Zealand JV. On February 29, 2016, the contracts were settled for a net premium of   $0.3 million  . The gain on these contracts was recorded in  Other operating income, net  as they did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
  On February 29, 2016, the Company purchased a foreign exchange forward contract (notional amount   $159.5 million  ) to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign exchange rate contracts when funding the capital contribution to the New Zealand JV. The contract matured on March 3, 2016, resulting in a gain of   $0.9 million  . The gain on this contract was recorded in  Other operating income, net  as it did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

Interest Rate Swaps 
  The Company used interest rate swaps to manage the New Zealand JV s exposure to interest rate movements on its variable rate debt attributable to changes in the New Zealand Bank bill rate. On March 3, 2016, as part of the capital contribution into the New Zealand JV, the Company settled all remaining New Zealand JV interest rate swaps for   $9.3 million  . Initially, these hedges qualified for hedge accounting; however, upon consolidation of the New Zealand JV in 2013, the hedges no longer qualified, requiring all future changes in the fair market value of the hedges to be recorded in earnings.  
  The Company is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable-rate Term Credit Agreement and Incremental Term Loan Agreement (as discussed below), and uses variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure. For these derivative instruments, the Company reports the gains/losses from the fluctuations in the fair market value of the hedges in AOCI and reclassifies them to earnings as interest expense in the same period in which the hedged interest payments affect earnings. 
  In August 2015, the Company entered into a   nine  -year interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of   $170 million  . This swap agreement fixes the variable portion of the interest rate on the Term Credit Agreement borrowings due 2024 from LIBOR to an average rate of   2.20%  . Together with the bank margin of   1.63%  , this results in a rate of   3.83%   before estimated patronage payments. This derivative instrument has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting. 
  Also, in August 2015, the Company entered into a   nine  -year forward interest rate swap agreement with a start date in April 2016 for a notional amount of   $180 million  . This swap agreement fixes the variable portion of the interest rate on the Term Credit Agreement borrowings due 2024 from LIBOR to an average rate of   2.35%  . Together with the bank margin of   1.63%  , this results in a rate of   3.97%   before estimated patronage payments. This derivative instrument has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting. 
  In April 2016, the Company entered into   two     ten  -year interest rate swap agreements, each for a notional amount of   $100 million  . These swap agreements fix the variable portion of the interest rate on the Incremental Term Loan borrowings due 2026 to an average rate of   1.60%  . Together with the bank margin of   1.90%  , this results in a rate of   3.50%   before estimated patronage payments. These derivative instruments have been designated as interest rate cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting. 
  On July 7, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of   $100 million   through May 2026. This swap agreement fixes the variable portion of the interest rate on the Incremental Term Loan borrowings due 2026 from LIBOR to an average rate of   1.26%  . Together with the bank margin of   1.90%  , this results in a rate of   3.16%   before estimated patronage payments. This derivative instrument has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting.

    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
     Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  A three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value was established in the Accounting Standards Codification as follows: 
  Level 1     Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Level 2         Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. 
  Level 3         Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. (a) 
  The following table presents the carrying amount and estimated fair values of financial instruments held by the Company at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , using market information and what the Company believes to be appropriate valuation methodologies under generally accepted accounting principles: 

(b) 
    Restricted cash is recorded in  Other Assets  and represents the proceeds from like-kind exchange sales deposited with a third-party intermediary and cash held in escrow for a real estate sale. See   Note 17       Restricted Deposits   for additional information regarding restricted cash.  
              (c) 
    The carrying amount of long-term debt is presented net of capitalized debt costs on non-revolving debt. See   Note 1       Basis of Presentation   for additional information.  
              (d) 
    See   Note 12       Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities   for information regarding the Balance Sheet classification of the Company s derivative financial instruments. 
     Rayonier uses the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments: 
  Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash     The carrying amount is equal to fair market value. 
  Debt     The fair value of fixed rate debt is based upon quoted market prices for debt with similar terms and maturities. The variable rate debt adjusts with changes in the market rate, therefore the carrying value approximates fair value.  
  Interest rate swap agreements     The fair value of interest rate contracts is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows, for each instrument, at prevailing interest rates.  
  Foreign currency exchange contracts     The fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts is determined by a mark-to-market valuation which estimates fair value by discounting the difference between the contracted forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate.  
  Foreign currency option contracts     The fair value of foreign currency option contracts is based on a mark-to-market calculation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
     The Company has   one   qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering a portion of its employees and an unfunded plan that provides benefits in excess of amounts allowable under current tax law in the qualified plan. Currently, the pension plan is closed to new participants. Employee benefit plan liabilities are calculated using actuarial estimates and management assumptions. These estimates are based on historical information, along with certain assumptions about future events. Changes in assumptions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause the estimates to change. In   2016  , the Company has no mandatory pension contribution requirement. 
  The net pension and postretirement benefit costs that have been recorded are shown in the following table:

    RESTRICTED DEPOSITS  
     In order to qualify for like-kind exchange ( LKE ) treatment, the proceeds from real estate sales must be deposited with a third-party intermediary. These proceeds are accounted for as restricted cash until a suitable replacement property is acquired. In the event LKE purchases are not completed, the proceeds are returned to the Company after   180 days   and reclassified as available cash. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $1.1 million   and   $23.5 million  , respectively, of proceeds from real estate sales classified as restricted cash in  Other Assets,  which includes cash deposited with an LKE intermediary as well as cash held in escrow for a real estate sale.

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
     When we refer to  we,   us,   our,   the Company,  or  Rayonier,  we mean Rayonier Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. References herein to  Notes to Financial Statements  refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Rayonier Inc. included in Item 1 of this Report.  
  This MD A is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors which may affect future results. Our MD A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ) and information contained in our subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). 
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements in this document regarding anticipated financial outcomes including Rayonier s earnings guidance, if any, business and market conditions, outlook, expected dividend rate, Rayonier s business strategies, including expected harvest schedules, timberland acquisitions, sales of non-strategic timberlands, the anticipated benefits of Rayonier s business strategies, and other similar statements relating to Rayonier s future events, developments, or financial or operational performance or results, are  forward-looking statements  made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as  may,   will,   should,   expect,   estimate,   believe,   intend,   project,   anticipate  and other similar language. However, the absence of these or similar words or expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. While management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. The risk factors contained in Item 1A     Risk Factors   in the 2015 Form 10-K and similar discussions included in other reports that we subsequently file with the SEC, among others, could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the Company s historical experience and those expressed in forward-looking statements made in this document. 
  Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law. You are advised, however, to review any subsequent disclosures the Company makes on related subjects in its subsequent reports filed with the SEC.  
  Non-GAAP Measures 
  To supplement Rayonier s financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ), Rayonier uses certain non-GAAP measures, including  cash available for distribution,  and  Adjusted EBITDA,  which are defined and further explained in   Performance and Liquidity Indicators   below. Reconciliation of such measures to the nearest GAAP measures can also be found in   Performance and Liquidity Indicators   below. Rayonier s definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. These non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Our Company 
  We are a leading timberland real estate investment trust ( REIT ) with assets located in some of the most productive softwood timber growing regions in the United States and New Zealand. Our revenues, operating income and cash flows are primarily derived from the following core business segments: Southern Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber, New Zealand Timber, Real Estate and Trading. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned or leased under long-term agreements approximately 2.3 million acres of timberlands located in the U.S. South (1.9 million acres) and U.S. Pacific Northwest (379,000 acres). We also have a 77% ownership interest in Matariki Forestry Group, a joint venture ( New Zealand JV ), that owns or leases approximately 436,000 acres (299,000 net plantable acres) of timberlands in New Zealand.  
  The Southern Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber and New Zealand Timber segments include all activities related to the harvesting of timber and other non-timber income activities, such as the leasing of properties for hunting, mineral extraction and cell towers. The New Zealand Timber segment also reflects any land or leasehold sales that occur within our New Zealand portfolio. 
  The Real Estate segment includes all U.S. land sales disaggregated into five sales categories: Improved Development, Unimproved Development, Rural, Non-Strategic / Timberlands and Large Dispositions.  
  The Trading segment reflects the log trading activities that support our New Zealand operations. The Trading segment complements the New Zealand Timber segment by adding scale and achieving cost savings that directly benefit the New Zealand Timber segment. Trading also generally contributes modestly to earnings without significant investment and provides market intelligence that benefits the timber business. 
   
  Industry and Market Conditions 
  The demand for timber is directly related to the underlying demand for pulp, paper, packaging, lumber and other wood products. The significant majority of timber sold in our Southern Timber segment is consumed domestically. With a higher proportion of pulpwood, our Southern Timber segment relies heavily on downstream markets for pulp and paper, and to a lesser extent wood pellet markets. Our Pacific Northwest segment relies primarily on domestic customers but also exports a significant volume of timber, particularly to China. Both the Southern and Pacific Northwest Timber segments rely on the strength of U.S. lumber markets as well as underlying housing starts. Our New Zealand Timber segment sells timber to domestic New Zealand wood products mills and also exports a significant portion of its volume to markets in China, Korea and India. In addition to market dynamics in the Pacific Rim, the New Zealand Timber segment is subject to foreign exchange fluctuations, which can impact the competitiveness of its products.  
  The Company is also subject to the risk of price fluctuations in its major cost components. The primary components of the Company's cost of sales are the cost basis of timber sold (depletion), the cost basis of real estate sold and logging and transportation costs (cut and haul). Depletion includes the amortization of capitalized costs (site preparation, planting and fertilization, real estate taxes, timberland lease payments, road and bridge construction, software and certain payroll costs). Other costs include depreciation of fixed assets and equipment, road maintenance, severance and excise taxes, fire prevention and real estate commissions and closing costs. 
  For additional information on market conditions impacting our business, see   Results of Operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical data and trends, current fact patterns, expectations and other sources of information we believe are reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a full description of our critical accounting policies, see Item 7     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   in the 2015 Form 10-K.

Southern Timber 
    Third   quarter sales of   $27.8 million     decreased     $7.0 million  , or   20%  ,   versus     the prior year period  . Harvest volumes decreased   23%   to   1.09 million   tons versus   1.42 million   tons in the prior year period. This decrease in harvest volumes was driven by wet weather in the Gulf states, which restricted our ability to harvest in that region, and curtailed harvest activity in certain eastern markets in response to softer market conditions resulting from dry weather and higher mill inventories. Average sawtimber stumpage prices decreased   4%   to   $26.17   per ton versus   $27.27   per ton in the prior year period, while average pulpwood stumpage prices increased   6%   to   $17.36   per ton versus   $16.39   per ton in   the prior year period  . The decrease in average sawtimber prices was driven by mix, specifically heavy rainfall resulting in decreased volume in one of the Company s higher-priced sawtimber regions. The increase in average pulpwood prices was also driven by mix, as an increased proportion of volume came from higher-priced regions. Overall, weighted-average stumpage prices (including hardwood) increased   1%   to   $19.76   per ton versus   $19.63   per ton in   the prior year period  . Operating income of   $8.2 million     decreased     $2.3 million     versus     the prior year period   due to lower volumes (  $3.0 million  ),   higher   overhead and road maintenance costs (  $0.3 million  ) and lower non-timber income (  $0.2 million  ), which were partially offset by lower depletion rates (  $1.0 million  ) and   higher   weighted-average stumpage prices (  $0.2 million  ).   Third   quarter Adjusted EBITDA of   $18.2 million   was   $6.7 million     below     the prior year period  . 
    Year-to-date   sales of   $102.2 million     decreased     $0.8 million  , or   1%  , versus   the prior year period  . Harvest volumes   decreased     1%   to   4.03 million   tons versus   4.08 million   tons in the prior year period. This decrease in harvest volumes was driven by extreme wet weather conditions in certain markets. Average pulpwood stumpage prices   increased     1%   to   $18.34   per ton versus   $18.09   per ton in   the prior year period  , while average sawtimber stumpage prices   decreased     4%   to   $26.74   per ton versus   $27.83   per ton in   the prior year period  . The   decrease   in average sawtimber prices was driven by mix, specifically a significant reduction in volume from one of the Company s higher-priced sawtimber regions. Average pulpwood prices continued to be well above south-wide benchmarks due to strong pricing in our core markets, particularly along the East Coast. Overall, weighted average stumpage prices (including hardwood)   decreased     1%   to   $20.54   per ton versus   $20.77   per ton in   the prior year period  . Operating income of   $35.0 million     increased     $0.3 million   versus   the prior year period   due to   lower   depletion rates (  $3.7 million  ), partially offset by   higher   road maintenance, leased land reforestation expense and overhead costs (  $1.2 million  ), other expense (  $0.7 million  ),   lower   prices (  $0.9 million  ),   lower   volumes (  $0.5 million  ) and   lower   non-timber income (  $0.1 million  ).   Year-to-date   Adjusted EBITDA of   $72.1 million   was   $4.0 million     below     the prior year period  . 
  Pacific Northwest Timber 
    Third   quarter sales of   $16.1 million     decreased     $5.5 million  , or   25%  ,   versus     the prior year period  . Harvest volumes   decreased     32%   to   241,000   tons versus   353,000   tons in   the prior year period  , as additional volume from our Oregon acquisition was more than offset by harvest curtailments in Washington in response to weaker than expected export market conditions in the beginning of the quarter. Average delivered sawtimber prices   increased     3%   to   $76.69   per ton   versus     $74.33   per ton in   the prior year period  , while average delivered pulpwood prices   decreased     13%   to   $40.07   per ton   versus     $45.88   per ton in   the prior year period  . The increase in average sawtimber prices was due to an overall strengthening of export and domestic sawtimber markets, combined with additional volume from Oregon, which generally commands a higher sawtimber price than Washington. The decrease in pulpwood prices was due to the increased availability of wood chips in certain market areas. Operating loss of   $3.3 million     versus   operating income of $3.1 million in the prior year period was primarily due to   higher   depletion rates resulting from our Oregon acquisition (  $3.8 million  ),   lower   volumes (  $2.6 million  ),   higher   overhead and severance taxes (  $0.5 million  ) and   lower   non-timber income (  $0.1 million  ), which were partially offset by   higher   prices (  $0.6 million  ).   Third   quarter Adjusted EBITDA of   $3.4 million   was   $3.9 million     below     the prior year period  . 
    Year-to-date   sales of   $52.3 million     decreased     $5.5 million  , or   9%  ,   versus     the prior year period  . Harvest volumes   decreased     10%   to   839,000   tons versus   928,000   tons in   the prior year period  . Average delivered sawtimber prices   decreased     2%   to   $72.80   per ton versus   $74.11   per ton in   the prior year period  , while average delivered pulpwood prices   decreased     4%   to   $42.85   per ton versus   $44.48   per ton in   the prior year period  . The decrease in average sawtimber prices was driven by continued weak demand in export markets and reduced local sawmill capacity, while the decrease in average pulpwood prices was driven by a reduction in market prices as more chip residuals entered the market from increased sawmill activity. Operating loss of   $0.9 million     versus   operating income of $7.4 million in   the prior year period   was primarily due to   higher   depletion rates (  $5.1 million  ),   lower   volumes (  $1.8 million  ),   lower   prices (  $0.7 million  ),   lower   non-timber income (  $0.6 million  ) and   higher   road maintenance, sales and engineering costs (  $0.1 million  ).   Year-to-date   Adjusted EBITDA of   $14.1 million   was   $4.2 million     below     the prior year period  .

New Zealand Timber 
    Third   quarter sales of   $42.2 million     increased     $1.1 million  , or   3%  ,   versus     the prior year period  . Harvest volumes   decreased     23%   to   552,000   tons   versus     721,000   tons in   the prior year period  . Average delivered prices for export sawtimber   increased     18%   to   $97.44   per ton   versus     $82.42   per ton in   the prior year period  , while average delivered prices for domestic sawtimber   increased     25%   to   $75.06   per ton   versus     $60.12   per ton in   the prior year period  . The   increase   in export sawtimber prices was primarily due to stronger demand from China. The   increase   in domestic sawtimber prices (in U.S. dollar terms) was driven primarily by strong demand for construction materials and the rise in the NZ$/US$ exchange rate (US  $0.72   per NZ  $1.00     versus   US  $0.66   per NZ  $1.00  ). Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, domestic sawtimber prices increased   15%   from the prior year period. Operating income of   $6.6 million     increased     $7.5 million   versus the prior year period due to   higher   prices (  $6.6 million  ), changes in volume/mix (  $0.3 million  ), lower depletion rates ($0.1 million), favorable changes in foreign exchange impacts (  $1.2 million  ) and higher carbon credit sales (  $0.3 million  ), which were partially offset by higher forest management and overhead costs (  $1.0 million  ).   Third   quarter Adjusted EBITDA of   $12.6 million   was   $6.5 million     above     the prior year period  . 
    Year-to-date   sales of   $126.0 million     increased     $4.5 million  , or   4%  , versus   the prior year period  . Harvest volumes   decreased     10%   to   1.66 million   tons versus   1.84 million   tons in   the prior year period  . Average delivered prices for export sawtimber   increased     8%   to   $96.04   per ton versus   $89.01   per ton in   the prior year period  , while average delivered prices for domestic sawtimber   increased     9%   to   $71.26   per ton versus   $65.54   per ton in   the prior year period  . The   increase   in export sawtimber prices was primarily due to stronger demand from China, while the   increase   in domestic sawtimber prices (in U.S. dollar terms) was driven primarily by stronger demand for construction material, partially offset by the fall in the NZ$/US$ exchange rate (US  $0.69   per NZ  $1.00   versus US  $0.72   per NZ  $1.00  ). Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, domestic sawtimber prices increased   13%   from   the prior year period  . Operating income of   $21.4 million     increased     $17.6 million   versus   the prior year period   due to   higher   prices (  $17.7 million  ), higher carbon sales (  $0.8 million  ), favorable mix/volumes (  $1.5 million  ) and   lower   depletion rates (  $0.3 million  ), which were partially offset by changes in foreign exchange impacts (  $0.2 million  ), change in land sales (  $1.7 million  ),   lower non-timber income ($0.3 million) and higher forest management costs (  $0.5 million  )  .   Year-to-date   Adjusted EBITDA of   $40.5 million   was   $14.5 million   above   the prior year period  . 
  Real Estate 
    Third   quarter sales of   $60.6 million     increased     $25.4 million   versus   the prior year period  , while operating income of   $43.1 million     increased     $23.1 million   versus   the prior year period  . Sales and operating income   increased   in the   third   quarter due to   higher   volumes (  23,601   acres sold versus   14,204   acres sold in the prior year period), and a 4% increase in weighted average prices (  $2,569   per acre versus   $2,480   per acre in the prior year period).   Third   quarter Adjusted EBITDA       of   $56.6 million   was   $25.7 million   above the prior year period. 
  Year-to-date   sales of   $211.3 million     increased     $145.3 million   versus the prior year period, while operating income of   $153.0 million     increased     $119.0 million   versus the prior year period.   Year-to-date   sales and operating income include   $129.5 million   and   $101.3 million  , respectively, of a Large Disposition. Sales and operating income increased in the first   nine   months due to higher volumes (  89,510   acres sold versus   23,938   acres sold in the prior year period), partially offset by lower weighted average prices (  $2,361   per acre versus   $2,756   per acre in the prior year period).   Year-to-date   operating income also increased due to the receipt of a   $4.0 million   deferred payment with respect to a prior land sale. 
  Unimproved     Development     third quarter sales of     $1.4 million     were comprised of a     73  -  acre tract in St. John s County, Florida for approximately     $18,500     per acre. Rural sal  es of   $6.4 million   were comprised of   2,069   acres at an average price of   $3,082   per acre. Non-strategic / Timberland sales of   $52.8 million   were comprised of   21,459   acres at an average price of   $2,465   per acre, including 17,772 acres in Georgia for $2,720 per acre. 
     Year-to-date   Adjusted EBITDA of   $74.0 million   was   $19.4 million     above   the prior year period.

Trading 
  Third   quarter sales of   $24.7 million     increased     $5.7 million     versus     the prior year period   due to   higher   volumes and prices. Sales volumes   increased     16%   to   269,000   tons   versus     231,000   tons in   the prior year period  . Average prices   increased     11%   to   $91.80   per ton   versus     $82.45   per ton in   the prior year period  . The increases in both volumes and prices were primarily due to stronger demand from China. Operating income of   $0.5 million   increased   $0.1 million   versus   the prior year period  . 
  Year-to-date sales of   $76.0 million     increased     $16.5 million     versus     the prior year period   due to   higher   volumes and prices. Sales volumes   increased     20%   to   816,000   tons   versus     679,000   tons in   the prior year period  . Average prices   increased     8%   to   $93.18   per ton   versus     $86.50   per ton in the   the prior year period  . The increase in both volume and price was primarily due to stronger demand from China. Operating income of   $1.5 million     increased     $0.8 million   versus   the prior year period  . 
  Other Items 
  Corporate and Other Expense/Eliminations 
    Third   quarter corporate and other operating expenses of   $5.4 million     increased     $0.1 million     versus     the prior year period   due to   increased   selling, general and administrative expenses (  $0.2 million  ) and timberland transaction costs (  $0.2 million  ), which were partially offset by   lower   costs related to shareholder litigation (  $0.3 million  ). Year-to-date corporate and other operating expense of   $18.5 million     decreased     $2.8 million     versus     the prior year period   primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses (  $2.6 million  ), a gain on foreign currency derivatives (  $1.2 million  ) and lower costs related to shareholder litigation (  $0.9 million  ), which were partially offset by timberland transaction costs (  $1.3 million  ) and other minor variances ($0.6 million). Costs related to shareholder litigation include expenses incurred as a result of the securities litigation, the shareholder derivative demands and the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. See Note 10     Contingencies   in the 2015 Form 10-K  . 
  Interest Expense  
    Third   quarter interest expense of   $8.5 million     increased     $0.9 million     versus     the prior year period   due to higher outstanding debt, partially offset by lower average rates and $0.4 million of expense related to the write-off of capitalized financing costs in the prior year period. Year-to-date interest expense of   $23.6 million   decreased $1.0 million   versus     the prior year period     primarily due to lower rates on the term credit agreement entered into in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by higher outstanding debt. 
  Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
    Third   quarter and year-to-date income tax expense of   $0.8 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively, was principally related to the New Zealand JV. 
  Share Repurchases 
  During the first quarter, the Company repurchased $0.7 million of common stock at an average price of $19.59 per share and did not repurchase any common stock in the second or third quarters. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   122.9 million   shares of common stock outstanding and $99.3 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. 
  Outlook    
    Based on our strong results for the first nine months and expectations for the balance of the year, we now anticipate full-year Adjusted EBITDA of $228 to $235 million, well above our prior guidance of $195 to $215 million. We continue to expect relatively flat prices in our Southern Timber and Pacific Northwest Timber segments for the remainder of the year, and we will continue to adjust harvest levels as appropriate to maximize the long-term value of our assets. In our New Zealand Timber segment, we expect continued strong performance driven by solid demand in both domestic and export markets. In our Real Estate segment, following an extraordinarily strong third quarter, we expect relatively light closings in the fourth quarter. We continue to be encouraged by interest in our Wildlight development project north of Jacksonville, Florida.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal source of cash is cash flow from operations, primarily the harvesting of timber and sales of real estate. As a REIT, our main use of cash is dividends. We also use cash to maintain the productivity of our timberlands through replanting and silviculture. Our operations have generally produced consistent cash flow and required limited capital resources. Short-term borrowings have helped fund working capital needs while acquisitions of timberlands generally require funding from external sources or asset dispositions. 
  Summary of Liquidity and Financing Commitments  

(a) 
    Enterprise value is calculated as the number of shares outstanding multiplied by the Company s share price plus net debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
     Cash Flows 
  The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015. 

Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
  The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was primarily attributable to higher operating results, partially offset by changes in working capital. 
  Cash Used for Investing Activities  
  Cash used for investing activities   increased     $111.2 million   compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in timberland acquisitions of   $265.4 million  , an increase in capital expenditures of   $3.0 million  , an increase in real estate development investments of   $2.8 million   and an increase in spending on the construction of the Company s office building of   $3.6 million  . This amount was partially offset by net proceeds from a Large Disposition of   $127.0 million   and a change in restricted cash of   $40.3 million  .  
  Cash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities  
  Cash provided by financing activities increased   $236.9 million   from the prior year period due to an increase in net debt issuances of   $162.4 million  , a decrease in common shares repurchases of   $72.9 million   and a decrease in dividends paid of   $2.2 million  .

Expected   2016   Expenditures 
  As part of Wildlight, our mixed-use community development project located north of Jacksonville at the interchange of I-95 and State Road A1A, we are constructing an office building expected to cost approximately $13 million. Of the $13 million, we expect to incur $8 million in 2016 and $5 million in 2017. The new office will allow consolidation of three leased offices in Jacksonville and Fernandina Beach, Florida into one location and also serve as a catalyst for the Company s mixed-use development project.  
  Capital expenditures in   2016   are expected to be between $60 and $65 million, excluding capital expenditures related to the office building and any strategic timberland acquisitions we may make. Capital expenditures are expected to be comprised primarily of seedling planting, fertilization and other silvicultural activities, property taxes, lease payments, allocated overhead and other capitalized costs. Aside from capital expenditures, we may also acquire timberland as we actively evaluate acquisition opportunities. Real estate development investments in 2016 are expected to be approximately $10 million. 
  Our   2016   dividend payments are expected to be approximately $123 million assuming no change in the quarterly dividend rate of $0.25 per share or material changes in the number of shares outstanding. 
  Future share repurchases, if any, will depend on the Company s liquidity and cash flow, as well as general market conditions and other considerations including capital allocation priorities. 
  We have no mandatory pension contributions in   2016   but will likely be required to make contributions in the future. We also may make discretionary contributions in the future. On an ongoing basis, cash income tax payments are expected to be minimal.  

Performance and Liquidity Indicators 
  The discussion below is presented to enhance the reader s understanding of our operating performance, liquidity, ability to generate cash and satisfy rating agency and creditor requirements. This information includes two measures of financial results: Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ) and Cash Available for Distribution ( CAD ). These measures are not defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ), and the discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and CAD is not intended to conflict with or change any of the GAAP disclosures described above. 
  Management uses CAD as a liquidity measure. CAD is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to measure cash generated during a period that is available for dividend distribution, repurchase of the Company s common shares, debt reduction and strategic acquisitions. We define CAD as cash provided by operating activities adjusted for capital spending (excluding timberland acquisitions and spending on the Company s office building) and working capital and other balance sheet changes. CAD is not necessarily indicative of the CAD that may be generated in future periods. 
  Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to make strategic decisions about the business and that investors can use to evaluate the operational performance of the assets under management. It removes the impact of specific items that management believes do not directly reflect the core business operations on an ongoing basis. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, the non-cash cost of land and improved development, costs related to shareholder litigation, the   gain on foreign currency derivatives   and Large Dispositions. Costs related to shareholder litigation include expenses incurred as a result of the securities litigation, the shareholder derivative demands and the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. See Note 10   Contingencies     in the 2015 Form 10-K.

We reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income for the consolidated Company and to Operating Income for the Segments, as those are the most comparable GAAP measures for each. The following table provides a reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA for the respective periods (in millions of dollars): 

(a)  
    Costs related to shareholder litigation include expenses incurred as a result of the securities litigation, the shareholder derivative demands and the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. See Note 10   Contingencies   in the 2015 Form 10-K. 
              (b)  
    Gain on foreign currency derivatives     is the gain resulting from the foreign exchange derivatives the Company used to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates while awaiting the capital contribution to the New Zealand JV. 
              (c) 
    Large Dispositions are defined as transactions involving the sale of timberland that exceed $20 million in size and do not have any identified HBU premium relative to timberland value. On April 28, 2016, the Company completed a disposition of approximately 55,000 acres located in Washington   f  or a sale price and gain of approximately   $129.5 million   and   $101.3 million  , respectively.

Liquidity Facilities 
  Incremental Term Loan Agreement 
  On April 28, 2016, the Company entered into an incremental term loan agreement with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of Farm Credit institutions to provide a 10-year, $300 million incremental term loan. Proceeds from the new term loan were used to fund Rayonier s portion of the Menasha acquisition net of the proceeds received from the Washington disposition, to repay approximately $105 million outstanding on the Company s revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The Company has entered into an interest rate swap transaction to fix the cost of the term loan over its 10-year term. The periodic interest rate on the incremental term loan agreement is LIBOR plus 1.900%. The Company receives annual patronage payments, which are profit distributions made by a cooperative to its member-users based on the quantity or value of business done with the member-user. The Company estimates the effective interest rate for the third quarter was approximately 2.8% after consideration of the estimated patronage payments and interest rate swaps. 
  Term Credit Agreement 
    On August 5, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of Farm Credit institutions and other commercial banks to provide $550 million of new credit facilities, including a nine-year $350 million term loan facility. The Company has entered into an interest rate swap transaction to fix the cost of the term loan facility over its nine-year term. The periodic interest rate on the term credit agreement is LIBOR plus 1.625%. The Company estimates the effective interest rate for the third quarter was approximately 3.3% after consideration of the estimated patronage payments and interest rate swaps. 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  In August 2015, the Company entered into a five-year $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing the previous $200 million revolving credit facility and $100 million farm credit facility, which were scheduled to expire in April 2016 and December 2019, respectively. The periodic interest rate on the revolving credit facility is LIBOR plus 1.250%, with an unused commitment fee of 0.175%. 
  Net borrowings of $25.0 million were made during the third quarter of 2016 on the revolving credit facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had available borrowings of $169.5 million, net of $5.5 million to secure its outstanding letters of credit, under the revolving credit facility. 
  
    53 

Table of Contents  

Joint Venture Debt 
  During the first quarter, the Company used proceeds from the term loan facility to fund a capital contribution into the New Zealand JV, which the New Zealand JV in turn used for repayment of the outstanding amount of $155 million under its existing Tranche A credit facility. In addition, all interest rate swap contracts associated with this debt were settled for $9.3 million at the time of the debt repayment. 
  In June 2016, the New Zealand JV entered into a 12-month NZ$20.0 million working capital facility and an 18-month NZ$20.0 million working capital facility, replacing the previous NZ$40.0 million facility that expired in June 2016. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the New Zealand JV made additional borrowings and repayments of $146.1 million on its working capital facility. Additional draws totaling $29.2 million remain available on the working capital facility. In addition, the New Zealand JV paid $2.6 million of its shareholder loan held with the non-controlling interest party.  
  See   Note 5       Debt     for additional information on these agreements and other outstanding debt, as well as for information on covenants that must be met in connection with our mortgage notes, term credit agreement and the revolving credit facility. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  See   Note 10       Guarantees   for details on the letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Contractual Financial Obligations 
  In addition to using cash flow from operations, we finance our operations through the issuance of debt and by entering into leases. These financial obligations are recorded in accordance with accounting rules applicable to the underlying transaction, with the result that some are recorded as liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, while others are required to be disclosed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis.  
  The following table aggregates our contractual financial obligations as of   September 30, 2016   and anticipated cash spending by period:    

(a) 
    The book value of long-term debt, net of deferred financing costs, is currently recorded at $1,033.3 million on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet, but upon maturity the liability will be $1,037.0 million.  
              (b) 
    The book value of our current maturities of long-term debt is currently recorded at $31.8 million on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet, but upon maturity the liability will be $31.5 million.  
              (c) 
    Projected interest payments for variable rate debt were calculated based on outstanding principal amounts and interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (d) 
    Commitments represent payments expected to be made on derivative financial instruments (foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps). See   Note 12       Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities  . 
              (e) 
    Commitments include payments expected to be made on the construction of the Company s office building.

Item 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     Market and Other Economic Risks 
  We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Our objective is to minimize the economic impact of these market risks. We use derivatives in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Derivatives are managed by a senior executive committee whose responsibilities include initiating, managing and monitoring resulting exposures. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   we had $690 million of U.S. long-term variable rate debt. Our primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt results from changes in LIBOR. However, we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements on our term credit agreement by swapping existing borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates. The notional amount of outstanding interest rate swap contracts at   September 30, 2016   was $650 million. The term credit agreement and associated interest rate swaps mature in August 2024 and the incremental term loan agreement and associated interest rate swaps mature in May 2026. At this borrowing level, a hypothetical one-percentage point increase/decrease in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase/decrease of approximately $0.4 million in interest payments and expense over a 12 month period. 
  The fair market value of our U.S. long-term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk. The estimated fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt at   September 30, 2016   was $337 million compared to the $325 million principal amount. We use interest rates of debt with similar terms and maturities to estimate the fair value of our debt. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A hypothetical one-percentage point increase/decrease in prevailing interest rates at   September 30, 2016   would result in a corresponding decrease/increase in the fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt of approximately $17 million. 
  We estimate the periodic effective interest rate on U.S. long-term fixed and variable rate debt for the third quarter was approximately   3.3%   after consideration of interest rate swaps and estimated patronage payments, excluding unused commitment fees on the revolving credit facility.  
  The functional currency of the Company s New Zealand-based operations and New Zealand JV is the New Zealand dollar. Through these operations and our ownership in the New Zealand JV, we are exposed to foreign currency risk on cash held in foreign currencies and on foreign export sales and ocean freight payments that are predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars. To mitigate these risks, the New Zealand JV routinely enters into foreign currency exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts to hedge a portion of the New Zealand JV s foreign exchange exposure. At   September 30, 2016  , the New Zealand JV had foreign currency exchange contracts with a notional amount of   $25 million   and foreign currency option contracts with a notional amount of   $71 million   outstanding. The amount hedged represents 40% of forecast U.S. dollar denominated harvesting sales proceeds over the next 18 months and 31% of log trading sales proceeds over the next 3 months.  

Item 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Rayonier management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )), are designed with the objective of ensuring information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported or submitted within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no control evaluation can provide absolute assurance that all control exceptions and instances of fraud have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance that their objectives are achieved. 
  Based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  In the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , based upon the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of SEC Rule 13a-15, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that would materially affect or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  
     Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  In February 2016, the Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $100 million of Rayonier s common shares (the  share repurchase program ) to be made at management s discretion. The program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. There were no shares repurchased under this program in the   third   quarter of   2016   and there was $99.3 million, or approximately   3,741,915   shares based on the period end closing stock price of $26.54, available for repurchase as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  In 1996, we began a Common Share repurchase program (the  1996 anti-dilutive program ) to minimize the dilutive effect of our employee incentive stock plans on earnings per share. This program limits the number of shares that may be purchased each year to the greater of 1.5% of outstanding shares at the beginning of the year or the number of incentive shares issued to employees during the year. In October 2000, July 2003 and October 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of additional shares in the program totaling 2.1 million shares. None of these shares have expiration dates. There were no shares repurchased under this program in the   third   quarter of   2016   and there were   3,776,612   shares available for purchase at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table provides information regarding our purchases of     Rayonier common stock during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(a) 
    Includes 27 shares of the Company s common stock purchased in July from employees in non-open market transactions. The shares of stock were sold by current employees of the Company in exchange for cash that was used to pay withholding taxes associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards under the Company s stock incentive plan. The price per share surrendered is based on the closing price of the company s stock on the respective vesting dates of the awards. 
              (b) 
    Purchases made in open-market transactions under the $100 million share repurchase program announced on February 10, 2016.

     Deemed  125 compensation  as defined in Section 1.141(d) of the Plan. 

(j) 
    Amounts received after termination of employment are excluded. (See Section 1.141(b) of the Plan.) 

(k) 
    Differential Pay (as defined in Section 1.141(e) of the Plan). 

(l) 
    Describe adjustments to Plan Compensation:   All bonuses except the Annual Bonus program; all short term disability or disability salary continuation payments; foreign service 
  allowance. 

[  Note:   Any exclusions selected under this AA  5-3 that do not meet the safe harbor exclusions under Treas. Reg.  1.414(s)-1 as described in Section 1.97(a) of the Plan may cause the definition of Plan Compensation to fail to satisfy a safe harbor definition of compensation under Code  414(s). Failure to use a definition of Plan Compensation that satisfies the nondiscrimination requirements under Code  414(s) will cause the Plan to fail to qualify for any contribution safe harbors, such as the permitted disparity allocation or Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan safe harbors. Any adjustments to Plan Compensation under this AA  5-3 must be definitely determinable and preclude Employer discretion. See AA  6C-4 for the definition of Plan Compensation as it applies to Safe Harbor Contributions.  ] 
    
           2. 
    The Adoption Agreement is amended to read: 
       
           6-2 
    EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION FORMULA.   For the period designated in AA  6-4 below, the Employer will make the following Employer Contributions on behalf of Participants who satisfy the allocation conditions designated in AA  6-5 below. Any Employer Contribution authorized under this AA  6-2 will be allocated in accordance with the allocation formula selected under AA  6-3. 
                  (a) 
    Discretionary contribution.   The Employer will determine in its sole discretion how much, if any, it will make as an Employer Contribution. 
                
    (b)      Fixed contribution. 
                
    (1)             % of each Participant s Plan Compensation. 
                
    (2)    $        for each Participant. 
                
    (3)    The Employer Contribution will be determined in accordance with any Collective Bargaining Agreement(s) addressing retirement benefits of Collectively Bargained Employees under the Plan. 
                
    (c)      Service-based contribution.   The Employer will make the following contribution: 
                
    (1)      Discretionary.   A discretionary contribution determined as a uniform percentage of Plan Compensation or a uniform dollar amount for each period of service designated below. 
                
    (2)      Fixed percentage.         % of Plan Compensation paid for each period of service designated below. 
                
    (3)      Fixed dollar.   $         for each period of service designated below. 
     The service-based contribution will be based on the following periods of service: 
             
    (4)    Each Hour of Service 
                
    (5)    Each week of employment 
                
    (6)    Describe period:         
     The service-based contribution is subject to the following rules. 
             
    (7)    Describe any special provisions that apply to service-based contribution:         
     [  Note:   Any period described in subsection (6) must apply uniformly to all Participants and cannot exceed a 12-month period. Any special provisions under subsection (7) must satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements under Code 
   401(a)(4) and the regulations thereunder.  ] 
             
    (d)      Year of Service contribution.   The Employer will make an Employer Contribution based on Years of Service with the Employer. 
       
                          Years of Service            Contribution %                       (1) 
    For Years of Service between       and        
          % 
          (2) 
    For Years of Service between       and        
          % 
          (3) 
    For Years of Service between       and        
          % 
          (4) 
    For Years of Service       and above 
          % 

For this purpose, a Year of Service is each Plan Year during which an Employee completes at least 1,000 Hours of Service. Alternatively, a Year of Service is:         
  [  Note:   Any alternative definition of a Year of Service must meet the requirements of a Year of Service as defined in Section 2.03 of the Plan.  ] 

(e)       Prevailing Wage Formula.   The Employer will make a contribution for each Participant s Prevailing Wage Service based on the hourly contribution rate for the Participant s employment classification. (See Section 3.02(a)(5) of the Plan.) 
                
    (1)      Amount of contribution.   The Employer will make an Employer Contribution based on the hourly contribution rate for the Participant s employment classification. The Prevailing Wage Contribution will be determined as follows: 
                
    (i)    The Employer Contribution will be determined based on the required contribution rates for the employment classifications under the applicable federal, state or municipal prevailing wage laws. For any Employee performing Prevailing Wage Service, the Employer may make the required contribution for such service without designating the exact amount of such contribution. 
                
    (ii)    The Employer will make the Prevailing Wage Contribution based on the hourly contribution rates as set forth in the Addendum attached to this Adoption Agreement. However, if the required contribution under the applicable federal, state or municipal prevailing wage law provides for a greater contribution than set forth in the Addendum, the Employer may make the greater contribution as a Prevailing Wage Contribution. 
                
    (2)      Offset of other contributions.   The contributions under the Prevailing Wage Formula will offset the following contributions under this Plan. (See Section 3.02(a)(5) of the Plan.) 
                
    (i)    Employer Contributions (other than Safe Harbor Employer Contributions) 
                
    (ii)    Safe Harbor Employer Contributions. 
                
    (iii)    Qualified Nonelective Contributions (QNECs) 
                
    (iv)    Matching Contributions (other than Safe Harbor Matching Contributions) 
                
    (v)    Safe Harbor Matching Contributions. 
                
    (vi)    Qualified Matching Contributions (QMACs) 
     [  Note:   If subsection (ii) or (v) is checked, the Prevailing Wage contribution must satisfy the requirements for a Safe Harbor Contribution.  ] 
             
    (3)      Modification of default rules.   Section 3.02(a)(5) of the Plan contains default rules for administering the Prevailing Wage Formula. Complete this subsection (3) to modify the default provisions. 
                
    (i)      Application to Highly Compensated Employees.   Instead of applying only to Nonhighly Compensated Employees, the Prevailing Wage Formula applies to all eligible Participants, including Highly Compensated Employees. 
                
    (ii)      Minimum age and service conditions.   Instead of no minimum age or service condition, Prevailing Wage contributions are subject to a one Year of Service (as defined in AA 4-3) and age 21 minimum age and service requirement with semi-annual Entry Dates. 
                
    (iii)      Allocation conditions.   Instead of no allocation conditions, the Prevailing Wage contributions are subject to a 1,000 Hours of Service and last day employment allocation condition, as set forth under Section 3.09 of the Plan. 
                
    (iv)      Vesting.   Instead of 100% immediate vesting, Prevailing Wage contributions will vest under the following vesting schedule (as defined in Section 7.02 of the Plan): 
                
    (A)    6-year graded vesting schedule 
                
    (B)    3-year cliff vesting schedule 
                
    (v)      Describe:         
     [  Note:   Overriding the default provisions under this subsection (3) may restrict the ability of the Employer to take full credit for Prevailing Wage Contributions for purposes of satisfying its obligations under applicable federal, state or municipal prevailing wage laws. Any modifications must satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements under Code  401(a)(4) and should be consistent with the applicable federal, state or municipal prevailing wage laws. See Section 3.02(a)(5) of the Plan.  ] 
             
    (f)      Describe special rules for determining contributions under Plan:         
     [  Note:   Any special rules must be described in a manner that precludes Employer discretion and must satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements of Code  401(a)(4) and the regulations thereunder.  ] 

3. 
    The Adoption Agreement is amended to read: 

(a)      Pro rata allocation.   The discretionary Employer Contribution under AA  6-2 will be allocated: 
                
    (1)    as a uniform percentage of Plan Compensation. 
                
    (2)    as a uniform dollar amount. 
                
    (b)      Fixed contribution.   The fixed Employer Contribution under AA  6-2 will be allocated in accordance with the selections made under AA  6-2. 
                
    (c)      Permitted disparity allocation.   The discretionary Employer Contribution under AA  6-2 will be allocated under the two-step method (as defined in Section 3.02(a)(1)(ii)(A) of the Plan), using the Taxable Wage Base (as defined in Section 1.136 of the Plan) as the Integration Level. However, for any Plan Year in which the Plan is Top Heavy, the four-step method (as defined in Section 3.02(a)(1)(ii)(B) of the Plan) applies, unless provided otherwise under subsection (2) below. 
     To modify these default rules, complete the appropriate provision(s) below. 
             
    (1)      Integration Level.   Instead of the Taxable Wage Base, the Integration Level is: 
                
    (i)             % of the Taxable Wage Base, increased (but not above the Taxable Wage Base) to the next higher: 
           (A)   N/A                     (B)    $1 
        (C)   $100                      (D)    $1,000 
             
    (ii)    $       (not to exceed the Taxable Wage Base) 
                
    (iii)    20% of the Taxable Wage Base 
     [  Note:   See Section 3.02(a)(1)(ii) of the Plan for rules regarding the Maximum Disparity Rate that may be used where an Integration Level other than the Taxable Wage Base is selected.  ] 
             
    (2)      Four-step method. 
                
    (i)    Instead of applying only when the Plan is top heavy, the four-step method will always be used. 
                
    (ii)    The four-step method will never be used, even if the Plan is Top Heavy. 
                
    (iii)    In applying step one and step two under the four-step method, instead of using Total Compensation, the Plan will use Plan Compensation. (See Section 3.02(a)(1)(ii)(B) of the Plan.) 
                
    (3)      Describe   special rules for applying permitted disparity allocation formula:         
     [  Note:   Any special rules must satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements of Code  401(a)(4) and the regulations thereunder.  ] 
             
    (d)   Uniform points allocation.   The discretionary Employer Contribution designated in AA  6-2 will be allocated to each Participant in the ratio that each Participant's total points bears to the total points of all Participants. A Participant will receive the following points: 
                
    (1)            point(s) for each year(s) of age (attained as of the end of the Plan Year). 
                
    (2)            point(s) for each $        (not to exceed $200) of Plan Compensation. 
                
    (3)            point(s) for each        Year(s) of Service. For this purpose, Years of Service are determined: 
                
    (i)    In the same manner as determined for eligibility. 
                
    (ii)    In the same manner as determined for vesting. 
                
    (iii)    Points will not be provided with respect to Years of Service in excess of         . 
                
    (e)      Employee group allocation.   The Employer may make a separate Employer Contribution to the Participants in the following allocation groups. The Employer must notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of the contribution to be allocated to each allocation group. 
                
    (1)    A separate discretionary Employer Contribution may be made to each Participant of the Employer (i.e., each Participant is in his/her own allocation group). 
                
    (2)    A separate discretionary or fixed Employer Contribution may be made to the following allocation groups. If no fixed amount is designated for a particular allocation group, the contribution made for such allocation group will be allocated as a uniform percentage of Plan Compensation or as a uniform dollar amount to all Participants within that allocation group. 

[  Note  : The allocation groups designated above must be clearly defined in a manner that will not violate the definite allocation formula requirement of Treas. Reg.  1.401-1(b)(1)(ii). See Section 3.02(a)(1)(iv)(B)(V) of the Plan for restrictions that apply with respect to  short-service  Employees. In the case of self-employed individuals (i.e., sole proprietorships or partnerships), the requirements of 1.401(k)-1(a)(6) continue to apply, and the allocation method should not be such that a cash or deferred election is created for a self-employed individual as a result of application of the allocation method.  ] 
             
    (3)      Special rules.   The following special rules apply to the Employee group allocation formula. 
                
    (i)      Family Members.   In determining the separate groups under (2) above, each Family Member (as defined in Section 1.65 of the Plan) of a Five Percent Owner is always in a separate allocation group. If there are more than one Family Members, each Family Member will be in a separate allocation group. 
                
    (ii)      Benefiting Participants who do not receive Minimum Gateway Contribution.   In determining the separate groups under (2) above, Benefiting Participants who do not receive a Minimum Gateway Contribution are always in a separate allocation group. If there are more than one Benefiting Participants who do not receive a Minimum Gateway Contribution, each will be in a separate allocation group. (See Section 3.02(a)(1)(iv)(B)(III) of the Plan.) 
                
    (iii)      More than one Employee group.   Unless designated otherwise under this subsection (iii), if a Participant is in more than one allocation group described in (2) above during the Plan Year, the Participant will receive an Employer Contribution based on the Participant s status on the last day of the Plan Year. (See Section 3.02(a)(1)(iv)(A) of the Plan.) 
                
    (A)      Determined separately for each Employee group.   If a Participant is in more than one allocation group during the Plan Year, the Participant s share of the Employer Contribution will be based on the Participant s status for the part of the year the Participant is in each allocation group. 
                
    (B)      Describe:         
     [  Note:   Any language under this subsection (B) must be definitely determinable and may not violate the nondiscrimination requirements under Code  401(a)(4).  ] 
             
    (f)      Age-based allocation.   The discretionary Employer Contribution designated in AA  6-2 will be allocated under the age- based allocation formula so that each Participant receives a pro rata allocation based on adjusted Plan Compensation. For this purpose, a Participant s adjusted Plan Compensation is determined by multiplying the Participant s Plan Compensation by an Actuarial Factor (as described in Section 1.04 of the Plan). 
     A Participant s Actuarial Factor is determined based on a specified interest rate and mortality table. Unless designated otherwise under (1) or (2) below, the Plan will use an applicable interest rate of 8.5% and a UP-1984 mortality table. 
             
    (1)      Applicable interest rate.   Instead of 8.5%, the Plan will use an interest rate of         % (must be between 7.5% and 8.5%) in determining a Participant s Actuarial Factor. 
                
    (2)      Applicable mortality table.   Instead of the UP-1984 mortality table, the Plan will use the following mortality table in determining a Participant s Actuarial Factor:         
                
    (3)      Describe special rules applicable to age-based allocation:         
     [  Note:   See Exhibit A of the Plan for sample Actuarial Factors based on an 8.5% applicable interest rate and the UP-1984 mortality table. If an interest rate or mortality table other than 8.5% or UP-1984 is selected, appropriate Actuarial Factors must be calculated. Any alternative interest or mortality factors must meet the requirements for standard interest and mortality assumptions as defined in Treas. Reg.  1.401(a)(4)-12. Any special rules described under subsection (3) may not violate the nondiscrimination requirements under Code  401(a)(4).  ] 
             
    (g)      Service-based allocation formula.   The service-based Employer Contribution selected in AA  6-2 will be allocated in accordance with the selections made under the service-based allocation formula in AA  6-2. 
                
    (h)      Year of Service allocation formula.   The Year of Service Employer Contribution selected in AA  6-2 will be allocated in accordance with the selections made under the Year of Service allocation formula in AA  6-2. 
                
    (i)      Prevailing Wage allocation formula.   The Prevailing Wage Employer Contribution selected in AA  6-2 will be allocated in accordance with the selections made under the Prevailing Wage allocation formula in AA  6-2. The Employer may attach an Addendum to the Adoption Agreement setting forth the hourly contribution rate for the employment classifications eligible for Prevailing Wage contributions. 
                  (j) 
    Describe special rules for determining allocation formula:   The Contribution (known as Enhanced Retirement     contribution) will equal 3% of an Eligible Employee's compensation.     
     [  Note:   Any special rules must be described in a manner that precludes Employer discretion and must satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements of Code  401(a)(4) and the regulations thereunder.  ] 

4. The Adoption Agreement is amended to read: 
           6-4 
    SPECIAL RULES.   No special rules apply with respect to Employer Contributions under the Plan, except to the extent designated under this AA  6-4. Unless designated otherwise, in determining the amount of the Employer Contributions to be allocated under this AA  6, the Employer Contribution will be based on Plan Compensation earned during the Plan Year. (See Section 3.02(c) of the Plan.) 
                
    (a)      Period for determining Employer Contributions.   Instead of the Plan Year, Employer Contributions will be determined based on Plan Compensation earned during the following period: [  The Plan Year must be used if the permitted disparity allocation method is selected under AA  6-3 above.  ] 
                
    (1)   Plan Year quarter 
                
    (2)   calendar month 
                
    (3)   payroll period 
      [  Note:   Although Employer Contributions are determined on the basis of Plan Compensation earned during the period designated under this subsection, this does not require the Employer to actually make contributions or allocate contributions on the basis of such period. Employer Contributions may be contributed and allocated to Participants at any time within the contribution period permitted under Treas. Reg.  1.415(c)-1(b)(6)(B), regardless of the period selected under this subsection. Any alternative period designated under subsection (4) may not exceed a 12-month period and will apply uniformly to all Participants.  ] 
             
    (b)      Limit on Employer Contributions.   The Employer Contribution elected in AA  6-2 may not  exceed: 
                
    (1)             % of Plan Compensation 
         (2)    $        
   [  Note:   Any limitations under this subsection (3) must satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements of Code 
   401(a)(4) and the regulations thereunder.  ] 
             
    (c)      Offset of Employer Contribution. 
                
    (1)    A Participant s allocation of Employer Contributions under AA  6-2 of this Plan is reduced by contributions under        [  insert name of plan(s)  ]. (See Section 3.02(d)(2) of the Plan.) 
                
    (2)    In applying the offset under this subsection, the following rules apply:         
     [  Note:   Any language regarding the offset of benefits must satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements under Code  401(a)(4) and the regulations thereunder.  ] 
             
    (d)      Special rules:         
     [  Note:   Any special rules must satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements under Code  401(a)(4).  ] 

5. 
    The Adoption Agreement is amended to read: 
       
           8-2 
    VESTING SCHEDULE.   The vesting schedule under the Plan is as follows for both Employer Contributions and Matching Contributions, to the extent authorized under AA  6 and AA  6B. See Section 7.02 of the Plan for a description of the various vesting schedules under this AA  8-2. [  Note:   Any Prevailing Wage Contributions under AA  6-2, any Safe Harbor Contributions under AA  6C and any QNECs or QMACs under AA  6D are always 100% vested, regardless of any contrary selections in this AA  8-2 (unless provided otherwise under AA  6-2 for Prevailing Wage Contributions or under this AA  8-2 for any QACA Safe Harbor Contributions).  ] 
         (a)      Vesting schedule for Employer Contributions and Matching Contributions: 
    
                     ER 
    Match 

(1) 
    Full and immediate vesting. 

(2) 
    3-year cliff vesting schedule 

(3) 
    6-year graded vesting schedule 

(4) 
    5-year graded vesting schedule 

(5) 
    Modified vesting schedule 
        
          %  after 1 Year of Service 
            %  after 2 Years of Service 
            %  after 3 Years of Service 
        %  after 4 Years of Service 
            %  after 5 Years of Service 
      100% after 6 Years of Service 

[  Note:   If a modified vesting schedule is selected under this subsection (a), the vested percentage for every Year of Service must satisfy the vesting requirements under the 6-year graded vesting schedule, unless 100% vesting occurs after no more than 3 Years of Service.  ] 
             
    (b)      Special vesting schedule for QACA Safe Harbor Contributions.   Unless designated otherwise under this subsection, any QACA Safe Harbor Contributions will be 100% vested. However, if this subsection is checked, the following vesting schedule applies for QACA Safe Harbor Contributions. [  Note:   This subsection may be checked only if a QACA Safe Harbor Contribution is selected under AA  6C-2.  ] 
     Instead of being 100% vested, QACA Safe Harbor Contributions are subject to the following vesting schedule: 
             
    (i)    2-year cliff vesting 
                
    (ii)    1-year cliff vesting 
                
    (iii)    Graduated vesting 
              % after 1 Year of Service

 FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE RETIREMENT PLAN FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.2 

FIRST AMENDMENT 
  TO THE 
  RETIREMENT PLAN FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF RAYONIER INC. 
    
  Pursuant to Section 10.01 of the Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees of Rayonier Inc. (the  Plan ), Rayonier Inc. (the  Company ) hereby amends the Plan, effective as of December 31, 2016 (except as may be otherwise indicated), as follows:  
           1. 
    The foreword is amended by adding the following paragraph to the end thereof 
       
   Effective December 31, 2016, no further Benefit Service will be credited to any Participant.  
  2.    Section 1.11, the definition of Compensation, is amended by adding the following paragraph to the end of said Section: 
    
   Subject to the following sentence, but otherwise notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, Compensation earned after December 31, 2016, shall not be considered in determining a Member s Accrued Benefit. Bonuses earned in 2016 and paid before April 1, 2017, shall be counted as Compensation when determining a Member s Accrued Benefit. Such bonuses shall be treated as Compensation for 2017.  
  3.    Section 1.14, the definition of Eligibility Service, is amended in its entirety by replacing said Section with the following: 
    
            1.14 
    Eligibility Service   shall mean any employment recognized as such for the purposes of meeting the eligibility requirements for membership in the Plan as provided in Article 2 and for meeting the eligibility for benefits under the Plan as provided under Article 4.  
     4.    Section 1.18, the definition of Final Average Compensation is amended by adding the following new subparagraph (c) to the end of said Section: 
    
   c) Subject to the following sentence, but otherwise notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, Final Average Compensation will not include Compensation earned by the Member after December 31, 2016, or other amounts payable to a Member by or on behalf of the Company after December 31, 2016. Bonuses earned in 2016 and paid before April 1, 2017, may be taken into account as Final Average Compensation. Final Average Compensation under the Plan will not exceed the average of the annual compensation limits under Code Section 401(a)17 for the 5-year period ending December 31, 2016.  
  
   16/287    1 

5.    Section 1.37, the definition of Social Security Benefit, is amended in its entirety by deleting said section and replacing it with the following (modified language is highlighted for convenience): 
    
   1.37      Social Security Benefit   shall mean the amount of annual old age or disability insurance benefit under Title II of the Federal Social Security Act as determined by the Plan Administration Committee under reasonable rules uniformly applied, on the basis of such Act as in effect at the time of retirement or termination to which a Member or former Member is or would upon application be entitled, even though the Member does not receive such benefit because of his or her failure to apply therefor or he or she is ineligible therefor by reason of earnings he or she may be receiving in excess of any limit on earnings for full entitlement to such benefit. In computing the Member s Social Security Benefit, no wage index adjustment or cost of living adjustment shall be assumed with respect to any period after the end of the calendar year in which the Member retires or terminates service. For all years prior to retirement or other termination of employment with the Company where actual earnings are not available, the Member s Social Security Benefit shall be determined on the basis of the Member s actual earnings in conjunction with a salary increase assumption based on the actual yearly change in national average wages as determined by the Social Security Administration. If within 180 days after the later of (i) the earlier of (a) a Member s date of retirement or other termination of employment or (b) December 31, 2016, or (ii) the date on which a Member is notified of the retirement allowance or vested benefit to which he or she is entitled under the Plan, the Member provides documentation from the Social Security Administration as to his or her actual earnings history with respect to those prior years, his or her Social Security Benefit shall be redetermined using the actual earnings history. If this recalculation results in a different Social Security Benefit, his or her retirement allowance or vested benefit shall be adjusted to reflect this change. Any adjustment to his or her retirement allowance or vested benefit shall be made retroactive to the date his or her payments commenced. The Plan Administration Committee shall resolve any questions arising under this Section on a basis uniformly applicable to all Employees similarly situated. 
  Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, effective December 31, 2016, the following modifications to the definition of the Social Security Benefit will apply: 
            b) 
    The Social Security Benefit for a Member who is actively employed on December 31, 2016, who thereafter commences a vested retirement benefit under Section 4.05, and who is not eligible for a retirement benefit under Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03 or 4.04 as of his Benefit Commencement Date shall remain fixed at the amount determined by assuming the Member terminated employment on December 31, 2016.  
              c) 
    The Social Security Benefit for a Member who is actively employed as of December 31, 2016 and is not eligible for a retirement benefit under Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03 or 4.04 but becomes eligible thereafter shall be determined by assuming the Member had terminated employment on the day he or she would have first become eligible for a retirement allowance under Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, or 4.04. The Social Security compensation to be used for the period beginning January 1, 2017, and ending on the date specified in the previous sentence shall be equal to the rate of Social Security compensation received by the Member during the 2016 calendar year, and zero thereafter. For purposes of this subsection (c), the Social  
     
   16/287    2 

Security Benefit will be assumed to commence on the later of age 62 or the first day of the month commencing after the Member first becomes eligible for a benefit under Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03 or 4.04. In computing the Member s Social Security Benefit, no wage index adjustment or cost of living adjustment shall be assumed with respect to any period after December 31, 2016.  
  6.    Section 2.02, Benefit Service, is amended by replacing the second paragraph following subparagraph (d)(vii) with the following paragraph (new language highlighted for convenience): 
    
   The Compensation of a Member during the periods of absence covered by clause (i), (ii), (iv) or (vi) above shall be the Compensation the Member actually receives during such period. The Compensation of a Member during the period of absence covered by clause (iii) above shall be deemed to be the Member s Final Average Compensation based on his or her Eligibility Service up to such absence.  Any Compensation described in the previous sentence will cease to be credited to a Member after December 31, 2016. Unless the Plan Administration Committee determines otherwise on a basis uniformly applicable to all persons similarly situated, the Social Security Benefit of a Member covered by clause (iii) above shall be based on the benefit awarded by the Social Security Administration at the date of his or her total and permanent disability.  
  7.    Section 2.02, Benefit Service, is amended by adding the following subsection (g) to the end of said Section: 
    
            (g) 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.02, periods of employment completed after December 31, 2016, and recognized periods absences occurring after December 31, 2016, shall not be considered in determining Benefit Service for any purposes under the Plan.

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Rayonier Inc. has caused this First Amendment to the Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees of Rayonier Inc. to be executed by a duly authorized officer on this ____ day of _____________________ 2016, but to be effective as of December 31, 2016, except as otherwise indicated.

 AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PAY PLAN

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.3 

Rayonier Inc.       Amended and Restated  
  Executive Severance Pay Plan 

Human Resources 
  December 31, 2016     

RAYONIER INC. 
  EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PAY PLAN 
  1.    Purpose 
  The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Rayonier Inc. recognizes that, as with many publicly held corporations, there exists the possibility of a Change in Control of the Company. This possibility and the uncertainty it creates may result in the loss or distraction of senior executives of the Company, to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders. 
  Accordingly, the Committee has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to assure the Company of the continued employment, attention and dedication to duty of its senior executives-including maintaining professionalism, indifference and objectivity in negotiating with a potential acquirer and to seek to ensure the availability of their continued service, notwithstanding the possibility, threat, or occurrence of a Change in Control. 
  Therefore  ,   in     order     to     fulfill     the     above     purposes, this Executive Severance Pay Plan is adopted and amended     effective as     specified     in     Section 17  .    
  The definitions of capitalized terms are located in   Section 8  . 
  2.    Covered Employees 
  Covered employees under this Plan are those full-time, regular executive salaried employees of the Company, who are identified and designated as Tier I or Tier II on   Appendix A   attached hereto (each an "  Executive  "), as such   Appendix A   may be amended by the Committee from time to time prior to a Change in Control. 
  An Executive shall cease to be a participant in this Plan only as a result of termination or amendment of this Plan complying with   Section 13  , or when he or she ceases to be a full time employee of the Company, unless, at the time he or she ceases to be an employee, such Executive is entitled to payment of Separation Benefits as provided in this Plan or there has been an event or occurrence that constitutes Good Reason after a Change in Control that would enable Executive to terminate his or her employment and receive Separation Benefits. An Executive entitled to payment of Separation Benefits under the Plan shall remain a participant in the Plan until the full amount of the Separation Benefits has been paid to Executive. 
  3.    Upon a Qualifying Termination  
           A. 
    Qualifying Termination.    If, within two years following a Change in Control, (a) an Executive terminates his or her full time employment for Good Reason, or (b) the Company terminates an Executive's full time employment, the Executive shall be provided Scheduled Severance  

90586109.9 

Pay and Additional Severance (collectively,    Separation Benefits   ) in accordance with the terms of this Plan, except that Separation Benefits shall not be payable where Executive: 
             
    is terminated for Cause; 
                
    voluntarily resigns (including normal retirement), other than for Good Reason; 
                
    voluntarily fails to return from an approved leave of absence (including a medical leave of absence); or 
                
    terminates employment as a result of Executive's death or Disability.  
     Any non-excepted termination is a "  Qualifying Termination  ."  
           B. 
    Definitions Related to Qualifying Termination  .  For purposes of this   Section 3,   the following terms have the indicated definitions: 
     "  Cause  " shall mean with respect to any Executive: (i) the willful and continued failure of Executive for a period of ninety (90) days to perform substantially Executive's duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Executive by the Board of Directors of the Company that specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that Executive has not substantially performed Executive's duties, or (ii) the engaging by Executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that is demonstrably injurious to the Company. For purposes of this definition, no act or failure to act on the part of Executive shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by Executive without reasonable belief that Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act or failure to act based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by Executive in good faith and, in the best interests of the Company. An Executive shall be deemed to have engaged in illegal conduct and shall be subject to termination for Cause if Executive has been indicted or charged by any prosecuting agency with the commission of a felony. 
  "  Disability  " shall mean an illness or injury that has prevented Executive from performing his or her duties (as they existed immediately prior to the illness or injury) on a full-time basis for 180 consecutive business days. 
  "  Good Reason  " shall mean, with respect to any Executive: (i) the assignment to Executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities immediately before the Change in Control, or any other action by the Company that results in a significant diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by Executive; (ii) any material  

90586109.9 

reduction in Executive's Base Pay, opportunity to earn annual bonuses or other compensation or employee benefits, other than as a result of an isolated and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and that is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by Executive; (iii) the Company's requiring Executive to relocate his or her principal place of business to a place which is more than thirty-five (35) miles from his or her previous principal place of business; or (iv) any purported termination of this Plan otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no termination shall be deemed to be for Good Reason unless (1) Executive gives written notice to the Company of the event or condition claimed to constitute Good Reason within ninety (90) days of the first occurrence of such event or condition, (2) the Company fails to cure such event or condition within thirty (30) days of such notice, and (3) Executive gives a notice of termination specifying a date of termination not later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after delivery by Executive of the written notice to the Company of the event or condition claimed to constitute Good Reason. 
    
  4.    Plan Benefits 
  For purposes of this Plan,    Plan Benefits    consist of (i) Scheduled Severance Pay calculated as provided in   Section 4A  , (ii) Additional Severance calculated as provided in   Section 4B   and   Section 4C  , and (iii) Equity Benefits as provided in   Section 4D  .  The Company shall pay the Scheduled Severance Pay and Additional Severance to Executive in a lump sum not later than ten (10) days after the Effective Date of the Executive s Qualifying Termination; provided that, no portion of the Scheduled Severance Pay or Additional Severance that is payable on account of an Executive s Separation from Service shall be paid earlier than the end of the Separation Delay Period if the payment is on account of such Separation from Service and at that date the Executive is a Specified Employee; provided that, such delay in payment shall not apply to any portion of the Scheduled Severance Pay or Additional Severance that is excepted from such delay under the Code Section 409A Rules as a Short-Term Deferral or Separation Pay.  The Company shall pay the Equity Benefits as provided in   Section 4D   upon the Executive s Qualifying Termination; provided that, no portion of the Equity Benefits that is payable as a result of the Executive s Separation from Service, shall be paid prior to the     end of the Separation Delay Period if on the date of such Separation from Service the Executive was a Specified Employee; and provided further that, such delay in payment shall not apply to any such amounts that are excepted from such delay under the Code Section 409A Rules as Short-Term Deferrals or Separation Pay. 
           A. 
    An Executive s    Scheduled Severance Pay    is the product of the Executive s Base Pay times the Executive s Applicable Tier Multiplier.     
              B. 
    An Executive s    Additional Severance    is the sum of the Executive s Benefits Continuation Amount, calculated as provided in   Section 4C   below, and the Executive s Bonus Severance, calculated as provided in this   Section 4B  . 
              (i) 
    An Executive s    Bonus Severance    is the product of the Executive s Applicable Bonus times the Executive s Applicable Tier Multiplier, together with an additional amount equal to the Executive s Current Pro-rata Bonus.   

90586109.9 

(1) 
    An Executive s    Applicable Bonus    is the greatest of (A) the average of the bonus amounts actually paid to the Executive under the Rayonier annual incentive bonus plan (the    Bonus Plan   ) in the three year period comprised of the year of the Qualifying Termination and the two immediately preceding calendar years, (B) the Executive s Target Bonus Award under the Bonus Plan for the year in which the Change in Control takes place or (C) the Executive s Target Bonus Award under the Bonus Plan in the year of Qualifying Termination.  The Executive s Applicable Bonus shall be determined without regard to any election the Executive may have made to defer receipt of all or any portion thereof as if there had been no deferral election in effect. 
              (2) 
    An Executive s    Current Pro-rata Bonus    is equal to the product of the Executive s Applicable Bonus times a fraction the numerator of which is the number of months or portion thereof lapsed in the then current year prior to the Qualifying Termination and the denominator of which is twelve.

90586109.9 

5.    Dispute Resolution 
           A.

The arbitrators shall presume that the rights and/or benefits afforded by this Plan which are in dispute are valid and enforceable and that Executive is entitled to such rights and/or benefits. The Company shall be precluded from asserting that such rights and/or benefits are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate before such arbitrators that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Plan. The burden of overcoming by clear and convincing evidence the presumption that Executive is entitled to such rights and/or benefits shall be on the Company. The results of any arbitration shall be conclusive on both parties and shall not be subject to judicial interference or review on any ground whatsoever, including without limitation any claim that the Company was wrongfully induced to enter into this agreement to arbitrate such a dispute.  
     The Company shall pay the cost of any arbitration proceedings under this Plan. Executive shall be entitled (within two (2) business days of requesting such advance) to an advance of the actual legal fees and expenses incurred by such Executive in connection with such proceedings and Executive shall be obligated to reimburse the Company for such fees and expenses in connection with such arbitration proceedings only if it is finally and specifically determined by the arbitrators that Executive's position in initiating the arbitration was frivolous and completely without merit.  
           B. 
    In the event Executive is required to defend in any legal action or other proceeding the validity or enforceability of any right or benefit afforded by this Plan, the Company will pay any and all actual legal fees and expenses incurred by such Executive regardless of the outcome of such action and, if requested by Executive, shall (within two business days of such request) advance such expenses to Executive. The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial or other proceeding commenced with respect to any right or benefit afforded by this Plan that such rights and benefits are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such proceeding that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Plan.

The Covenant Amount shall be equal to so much of the identified amount payable in cash as the Company shall designate in a written notice to Executive given within thirty (30) days of the Qualifying Termination; provided that, the Covenant Amount shall not exceed an amount equal to the Base Pay of Executive immediately before the Qualifying Termination, multiplied by the Executive s Applicable Tier Multiplier and determined by the Company in good faith to be reasonable compensation for the Change in Control Covenants.  By way of explanation and clarification, the Covenant Amount shall not be an additional payment beyond whatever is otherwise provided for within this Plan; rather, a portion of the payments that the Executive will otherwise receive hereunder shall be allocated as the Covenant Amount.  An Executive who receives a benefit under this Plan cannot opt to forego making the Change in Control Covenants. 
              B.

C. 
    Remedies Limited to Equitable Relief  .  By accepting payment of the Covenant Amount, Executive shall be deemed (a) to have acknowledged that in the event Executive breaches any of the Change in Control Covenants, the damages to the Company would be irreparable and that the Company shall have the right to seek injunctive and/or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the Change in Control Covenants and (b) to have  consented to the issuance of a temporary restraining order to maintain the status quo pending the outcome of any proceeding.  The foregoing shall be the exclusive remedy of the Company for a breach of the Change in Control Covenants and under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to seek return of all or any portion of the Covenant Amount or of any other amount payable hereunder, nor shall the Company be awarded or accept monetary damages for any such breach.  
       
  7.    Section 280G Cutback 
           A. 
    Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in the event that the payments and other benefits payable under this Plan or otherwise payable to an Executive under any other plan, program, arrangement or agreement maintained by the Company or one of its affiliates (i) would constitute an  excess parachute payment  (as defined under Code Section 280G) and (ii) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then such payments and other benefits shall be payable either (x) in full or (y) in a reduced amount that would result in no portion of such payments and other benefits being subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, and local income taxes and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, results in the receipt by such Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance benefits under this Plan or otherwise, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.  
              B. 
    The determination of whether it is necessary to decrease a payment or benefit to be paid under this Plan must be made in good faith by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm (the    Accounting Firm   ) selected by the Company. This determination will be conclusive and binding upon the Executive and the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity, or group effecting the Change in Control, the Company shall appoint another nationally recognized certified public accounting firm to make the determination required under this Plan. The Company shall bear all fees of the Accounting Firm. If a reduction is necessary, the Executive will have the right to designate the particular payment or benefit to be reduced or eliminated so that no portion of the payment or benefit to be paid to the Executive will be an excess parachute payment subject to the deduction limits under Section 280G of the Code and the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. However, no payment of  deferred compensation  (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(1), after giving effect to the exemptions in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.409A-1(b)(3) through (b)(12)) may be reduced to the extent that a reduction can be made to any payment or benefit that is not  deferred compensation.

Such notice shall, in addition, inform the claimant what procedure the claimant should follow to take advantage of the review procedures set forth below in the event the claimant desires to contest the denial of the claim. The claimant may within ninety (90) days thereafter submit in writing to the Company a notice that the claimant contests the denial of his or her claim by the Company and desires a further review. The Company shall within sixty (60) days thereafter review the claim and authorize the claimant to appear personally and review pertinent documents and submit issues and comments relating to the claim to the persons responsible for making the determination on behalf of the Company. The Company will render its final decision with specific reasons therefor in writing and will transmit it to the claimant within sixty (60) days of the written request for review, unless the Company determines additional time, not exceeding sixty (60) days, is needed, and so notifies the employee. If the Company fails to respond to a claim filed in accordance with the foregoing within sixty (60) days or any such extended period, the Company shall be deemed to have denied the claim. If the appeal is denied, the Committee s written notification to the claimant shall set forth: (1) the specific reason for the adverse determination; (2) specific reference to pertinent provisions on which the Committee based its adverse determination; (3) a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies, of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant s claim for benefits; and  (4) a statement that the claimant has a right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. 
  13.    Termination or Amendment 
  The Committee or the Company's Board of Directors may amend or terminate this Plan (a "  Plan Change  ") at any time, except that no such Plan Change may reduce or adversely affect Separation  

90586109.9 

Benefits for any Executive who has a Qualifying Termination within two years of the effective date of such Plan Change provided that Executive was a Covered Employee under this Plan on the date of the Plan Change; provided that (a) a change in   Appendix A   prior to a Change in Control shall not be deemed to be a Plan Change and (b) an Executive by accepting any benefit under this Plan that was introduced prior to a Change in Control and not available prior to the Plan Change, shall be deemed to have waived the two-year limitation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for two years after the occurrence of a Change in Control event, this Plan may not be terminated or amended until after all Executives who become entitled to any payments hereunder shall have received such payments in full. Any extension, amendment, or termination of this Plan in accordance with the foregoing shall be made in accordance with the Company's charter and bylaws and applicable law, and shall be evidenced by a written instrument signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company, certifying that such action has been taken. 
  14.    Plan Supersedes Prior Plans 
  This Plan supersedes and replaces all prior severance policies, plans, or practices maintained by the Company with respect to all Covered Employees other than individualized written agreements executed by the Company and Executive. 
  15.    Unfunded Plan Status 
  This Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees, within the meaning of Section 401 of ERISA. All payments pursuant to the Plan shall be made from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established or other segregation of assets made to assure payment. No Executive or other person shall have under any circumstances any interest in any particular property or assets of the Company as a result of participating in the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may but shall not be obligated to create one or more grantor trusts, such as the Legal Resources Trust and the Severance Trust, the assets of which are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors, to assist it in accumulating funds to pay its obligations under the Plan. 
  16.    Miscellaneous 
  Except as provided in this Plan, Executive shall not be entitled to any notice of termination or pay in lieu thereof. 
  In cases where Severance Pay is provided under this Plan, pay in lieu of any unused current year vacation entitlement will be paid to Executive in a lump sum.   
  This Plan is not a contract of employment, does not guarantee any Executive employment for any specified period and does not limit the right of the Company to terminate the employment of any Executive at any time. 
  The section headings contained in this Plan are included solely for convenience of reference and shall not in any way affect the meaning of any provision of this Plan. 

90586109.9 

If, for any reason, any one or more of the provisions or part of a provision contained in this Plan shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or part of a provision of this Plan not held so invalid, illegal or unenforceable, and each other provision or part of a provision shall to the full extent consistent with law remain in full force and effect. 
  17.    Adoption Date and Amendment 
  This Plan was first adopted effective March 1, 1994.  On May 16, 1997, changes to the Plan were approved effective as of June 1, 1997. Subsequently on July 18, 1997, additional changes to the Plan were approved effective retroactive to June 1, 1997. 
  On September 2, 2005, this amended and restated Plan was approved and adopted and renamed the Rayonier Inc. Executive Severance Pay Plan, effective as of that date, and on December 6, 2007, the Plan was amended to make certain changes to reflect the Code Section 409A Rules. In February 2015, additional changes were made and the Plan was amended and restated. Effective as of December 31, 2016, the Plan was again amended and restated.
