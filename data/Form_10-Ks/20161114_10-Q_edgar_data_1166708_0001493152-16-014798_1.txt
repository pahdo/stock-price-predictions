  NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1.  
       Description
    of business and summary of significant accounting policies    

Description
of business   Brownie s Marine Group, Inc., (hereinafter referred to as the  Company ,  we 
or  BWMG ) designs, tests, manufactures and distributes recreational hookah diving, yacht based scuba air compressor
and nitrox generation systems, and scuba and water safety products through its wholly owned subsidiary Trebor Industries, Inc.
The Company sells its products both on a wholesale and retail basis, and does so from its headquarters and manufacturing facility
in Pompano Beach, Florida. The Company does business as (dba) Brownie s Third Lung, the dba name of Trebor Industries, Inc.
The Company s common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets (Pink) under the symbol  BWMG .  

Basis
of Presentation    The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). In the opinion of management all normal recurring adjustments
considered necessary to give a fair presentation of operating results for the periods presented have been included.  

The
condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016, and the results of operations for the
three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the statement of stockholders  equity for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and the statements of cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The condensed
consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the entire year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived
from the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. While management of the Company believes
that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of the Company s Form 10-K which was filed on March
29, 2016.  

Definition
of fiscal year    The Company s fiscal year end is December 31.  

Use
of estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Reclassifications    Certain reclassifications may have been made to the 2015 financial statement amounts and disclosures to conform to
the 2016 financial statement presentation.  

Going
Concern    The accompanying condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the
Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business for the twelve-month period following the date of these financial statements. Although profitable
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we have frequently incurred losses since 2009.  

The
Company is behind on payments due for matured convertible debentures, related parties notes payable, accrued liabilities and interest
  related parties, and certain vendor payables. The Company is handling delinquencies on a case by case basis. However,
there can be no assurance that cooperation the Company has received thus far will continue.  

Because
the Company does not expect that existing operational cash flow will be sufficient to fund presently anticipated operations, this
raises substantial doubt about BWMG s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from date the financial statements
are issued. Therefore, the Company may need to raise additional funds and is currently exploring alternative sources of financing.
BWMG has issued a number of convertible debentures in the past as an interim measure to finance working capital needs and may
continue to raise additional capital through sale of restricted common stock or other securities, and obtaining some short term
loans. The Company has previously paid for some legal and consulting services with restricted stock to maximize working capital
and intends to continue this practice when possible. In addition, the Company implemented some cost saving measures and will continue
to explore more to reduce operating expenses.  

BROWNIE S
MARINE GROUP, INC.  

  NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

If
BWMG fails to raise additional funds when needed, or does not have sufficient cash flows from sales, it may be required to scale
back or cease operations, liquidate assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Cash
and equivalents    Only highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are classified as cash
and equivalents. These investments are stated at cost, which approximates market value.  

Accounts
receivable    Accounts receivable consist of amounts due from the sale of all of our products to wholesale and retail
customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical customer experience and industry knowledge.  

Inventory    Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined by using the average
cost method that approximates the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method of accounting for inventory. Inventory consists of raw materials
as well as finished goods held for sale. The Company s management monitors the inventory for excess and obsolete items and
makes necessary valuation adjustments when indicated.  

Property
and, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements    Property and, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements are stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation and/or amortization. Depreciation and amortization is provided principally on the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease, which are primarily 3 to 5 years. The cost of repairs and
maintenance is charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for property betterments and renewals are capitalized. Upon sale
or other disposition of a depreciable asset, cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or
loss is reflected in other income (expense).  

The
Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful
lives of fixed assets or whether the remaining balance of fixed assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. The Company
uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the fixed assets in measuring their recoverability.  

Revenue
recognition    Revenues from product sales are recognized when the Company s products are shipped or when service
is rendered. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage
of cost incurred to date to estimated total cost of each contract. This method is used because management considers the percentage
of cost incurred to date to estimated total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts.  

Contract
costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor,
supplies, tools, repairs, and depreciation costs. General and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions
for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Change in job performance,
job conditions, and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which
the revisions are determined. Revenue and costs incurred for time and material projects are recognized as the work is performed.  

Product
development costs    Product development expenditures are charged to expenses as incurred.  

Advertising
and marketing costs    The Company expenses the costs of producing advertisements and marketing material at the time
production occurs, and expenses the costs of communicating advertisements and participating in trade shows in the period in which
occur. Advertising and trade show expense incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $313 and $138 respectively.
Advertising and trade show expense incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $3,550 and $2,842, respectively.  

Customer
deposits and returns policy    The Company takes a minimum 50% deposit against custom and large tankfill systems prior
to ordering and/or building the systems. The remaining balance due is payable upon delivery, shipment, or installation of the
system. There is no provision for cancellation of custom orders once the deposit is accepted, nor return of the custom ordered
product. Additionally, returns of all other merchandise are subject to a 15% restocking fee as stated on each sales invoice.  

BROWNIE S
MARINE GROUP, INC.  

  NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Income
taxes    The Company accounts for its income taxes under the assets and liabilities method, which requires recognition
of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements
and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.  

The
Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized.
In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of
existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.
A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets that do not meet the criteria for recognition. In the event the
Company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded
amount, they would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.  

The
Company follows the accounting guidance which provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when
it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals
or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold
at the effective date to be recognized initially and in subsequent periods. Also included is guidance on measurement, derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  

Comprehensive
income    The Company has no components of other comprehensive income. Accordingly, net income equals comprehensive income
for all periods presented.  

Stock-based
compensation    The Company accounts for all compensation related to stock, options or warrants using a fair value based
method whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service
period, which is usually the vesting period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of
options and warrants issued to both employees and non-employees. Stock issued for compensation is valued on the effective date
of the agreement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which includes determination of the fair value of
the share-based transaction. The fair value is determined through use of the quoted stock price.  

Beneficial
conversion features on convertible debentures    The fair value of the stock upon which beneficial conversion feature
(BCF) computations, as applicable, was determined through use of the quoted stock price.  

Fair
value of financial instruments    Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement date. An entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure
fair value:  

Level
1 - Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2 - Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities
in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are
observable in active markets.  

Level
3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted
cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant
management judgment or estimation.  

BROWNIE S
MARINE GROUP, INC.  

  NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Inputs
are used in applying the various valuation techniques and broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make
valuation decisions, including assumptions about risk. An investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on
the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes
 observable  requires significant judgment by the Company. Management considers observable data to be market data
which is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, provided by multiple,
independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market. The categorization of an investment within the hierarchy
is based upon the pricing transparency of the investment and does not necessarily correspond to the Company s perceived
risk of that investment.  

At
September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable, accounts receivable   related
parties, customer deposits and unearned revenue, royalties payable   related parties, other liabilities, other liabilities
and accrued interest   related parties, notes payable, notes payable   related parties, and accounts payable and accrued
liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.  

Earnings
per common share    Basic earnings per share exclude any dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities.
Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares during the applicable period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive and common stock equivalent shares,
if any, outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive.
Potentially dilutive shares included in dilutive earnings per share totaled 4,845,004 shares for the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 2016. Potentially dilutive shares included in dilutive earnings per share totaled 48,965,429 shares and 47,325,387
shares for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

New

that either has not already been disclosed in prior reporting periods or is relevant to the readers of BWMG s financial
statements.

Balances
due certain vendors are in arrears to varying degrees. The Company is handling all delinquent accounts on a case-by-case basis.  

9.  
       OTHER
    LIABILITIES    

Other
liabilities consist of the following as of:    

The
short-term loans are comprised of two (2) loans due on demand from unrelated parties. The loans have no other stated terms except
one for $200,000 indicated it was for settlement of debenture debt. Therefore, the Company used the proceeds from that loan toward
settlement of convertible debentures.  

On-line
training certificates are provided with all hookah units sold. The training certificates entitle the holder to an on-line interactive
course at no additional charge to the holder. The number of on-line training certificates issued per unit is the same as the number
of divers the unit as sold is designed to accommodate (i.e., a three diver unit configuration comes with three on-line training
certificates). The certificates have eighteen-month redemption from the time customer purchases the unit before expiration. The
Company owes the on-line training vendor an agreed upon negotiated rate for on-line certificates redeemed prior to expiration,
and payment is due upon redemption. The Company estimates the on-line training liability based on a historical redemption rate
of approximately 10%. The Company continues to monitor and maintain a reserve for certificate redemption that approximates the
historical redemption rate.

Reference
numbers in right hand column of table entitled Ref. refer to paragraphs with corresponding numbers that immediately follow this
paragraph.  

(1) The
Company purchased in exchange for convertible debenture exclusive rights for license of certain intellectual property from an
unrelated party. The parties agreed to a royalty of 2.5% of net revenues generated from the sale, sub-license or use of the technology
or a reasonable negotiated rate based on similar invention. The debenture was convertible to common shares of the Company at May
27, 2011, along with accrued interest at the option of the lender. Conversion price per share is 30% discount as determined from
the weighted average of the preceding 12 trading days  closing market price. The Company valued the BCF of the convertible
debenture at $53,517, its intrinsic value. The Company accreted the discount to the convertible debenture and will recognize interest
expense through repayment in full or conversion. Because there was no assurance of success and the invention was still in design
and pre-prototype phase, the Company recorded the initial net value of the debenture, $71,483, as research and development expense
during the year ended 2010. Both parties agreed to confidentiality regarding the invention during the pre-prototype stage. In
addition, the Company agreed to provide the licensor with design services, as well as assist in completing the prototype and initial
production at the Company s prevailing wholesale rate for comparable services.  

On
February 10, 2012, the holder of this debenture entered into an agreement with a third party to sell/assign the $125,000 principal
balance, plus accrued interest. The purchase was to be in installments with transfer/assignment of the debenture upon payment,
referred to as  Closings . The first Closing was on or about February 15, 2012 for $7,500, with that amount assigned/transferred.
The second Closing, occurred 90 days after the first closing for $11,750 paid/assigned. All subsequent Closings were to be for
$11,750 and occur in 30 day increments after the second closing. This was to continue until the full principal balance of $125,000,
plus accrued interest is purchased or assigned. The holder of the convertible note has voluntarily dissolved and ceased operation.
In February 2016 both parties agreed to cancel the agreement and all remaining principal and interest balances.  

(2) On
May 3, 2011, the Company borrowed $300,000 in exchange for a convertible debenture. The Debenture bears 10% interest per annum.
The lender may at any time convert any portion of the debenture to common shares at a 30% discount of the  Market Price 
of the stock based on the average of the previous ten (10) days weighted average closing prices on the date prior to the notice
of conversion. The Company may prepay the debenture plus accrued interest at any time before maturity. In addition, as further
inducement for loaning the Company the funds, the Company granted the lender 300,000 and 600,000 warrants at $337.50 and $472.50
per share (after restatement for 1 for -1,350- reverse stock split), respectively. As a result, the Company allocated fair market
value ( FMV ) to both the BCF and to the warrants, or $206,832, which was recorded as a discount against the debenture.
The Company accreted the discount to the convertible debenture through maturity and will accrue interest expense until paid in
full or converted. Before discount, the Company determined the FMV of the warrants as $45,000 using the Black-Scholes valuation
model.

(3) The
Company borrowed $10,000 in exchange for a convertible debenture. The lender at their option may convert all or part of the note
plus accrued interest into common stock at a price of thirty percent (30%) discount as determined from the average four (4) highest
closing bid prices over the preceding five (5) trading days. The Company valued the BCF of the convertible debenture at $4,286,
which was accreted to interest expense.  

(4) The
Company entered into three new debenture agreements upon sale or assignment by the original lender. Because the stated terms of
the new debenture agreement and principal amounts were significantly different from the original debenture, including analysis
of the value of the beneficial conversion feature at the assignment or purchase date, the transactions are treated as extinguishment
of the old debentures and recorded as new for accounting purposes.  

12.  
       AUTHORIZATION
    OF PREFERRED STOCK    

During
the second quarter of 2010, the holder of the majority of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock approved an amendment
to the Company s Articles of Incorporation authorizing the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred
stock as authorized has such voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions and relative rights as may be
determined by our Board of Directors of the Company from time to time in accordance with the provisions of the Florida Business
Corporation Act. Before modification, the existing Articles of Incorporation did not authorize the issuance of shares of preferred
stock. The Company authorized the preferred stock for the purpose of added flexibility in seeking capital and potential acquisition
targets. The amendment authorizing the issuance of shares of preferred stock grants the Board authority, without further action
by our stockholders, to designate and issue preferred stock in one or more series and to designate certain rights, preferences
and restrictions of each series, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of the common stock. As of September 30, 2016,
and December 31, 2015, the 425,000 shares of preferred stock are owned by the Company s Chief Executive Officer. The preferred
shares have 250 to 1 voting rights over the common stock, and are convertible into 31,481 shares of common stock. The preferred
stock votes with the Company s common stock, except as otherwise required under Florida law. Accordingly, Mr. Carmichael
will have approximately 55% of the combined voting power of the Common Stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, voting
as a single class and will control the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the shareholders for
approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent
or cause a change in control.  

13.  
       COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES    

From
time to time the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including
matters relating to product liability claims. Such product liability claims sometimes involving wrongful death or injury have
historically been covered by product liability insurance, which provided coverage for each claim up to $1,000,000. During the
third quarter of 2014, the Company did not renew its product liability insurance since the renewal policy amount was cost prohibitive.
The Company is currently seeking a new insurance carrier or alternative means to satisfy this potential liability exposure, as
well as to fulfil the sales terms of some of our customers, which require the insurance coverage. The Company was a co-defendant
under an action filed by an individual in June 2013 in the Circuit Court of Broward County claiming personal injury resulting
from use of a Brownie s Third Lung. Plaintiff claimed damages in excess of $1,000,000. This matter was settled during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 by the Company s insurance carrier.  

As
previously disclosed, we are co-defendants under an action filed March 2015, in the Circuit Court of Broward County claiming personal
injury resulting from the use of a Brownie s Third Lung product. This claim falls outside the Company s period of
insurance coverage. As a result of a miscommunication with legal counsel a default has been entered against the Company in this
action for failing to file a timely response. The Company has obtained different legal representation in this matter and is now
attempting to have the default set aside. The Company still believes the claim to be a Workers Compensation claim relating exclusively
against another defendant and without merit, and plans to aggressively defend this action.  See  Foot Note 17.
Subsequent Events.  

On
August 14, 2014, the Company entered into a new lease commitment. Terms of the new lease include thirty-seven month term commencing
on September 1, 2014; payment of $5,367 security deposit; base rent of approximately $4,000 per month over the term of the lease
plus sales tax; and payment of 10.76% of annual operating expenses (i.e. common areas maintenance), which is approximately $2,000
per month subject to periodic adjustment.

       EQUITY
    INCENTIVE PLAN    

On
August 22, 2007, the Company adopted an Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ). Under the Plan, Stock Options may be granted
to employees, directors, and consultants in the form of Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options. Stock Purchase
Rights, time vested and/performance invested Restricted Stock, and Stock Appreciation Rights and Unrestricted Shares may also
be granted under the Plan. The initial maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan shall be 297 shares, and no
more than 75 Shares of Common Stock may be granted to any one Participant with respect to Options, Stock Purchase Rights and Stock
Appreciation Rights during any one calendar year period. Common Stock to be issued under the Plan may be either authorized and
unissued or shares held in treasury by the Company. The term of the Plan shall be ten years. The Board of Directors may amend,
alter, suspend, or terminate the Plan at any time. All 297 options were issued under the plan prior to January 1, 2010, and to-date
all remain outstanding.  

15.  
       EQUITY
    BASED INCENTIVE/RETENTION BONUSES    

On
November 2, 2012, the Board of Directors consented to grant equity based bonuses to certain key employees and consultants as an
incentive to retain their services. Stock incentive bonuses were to vest, and be paid out on May 2, 2013, contingent upon continued
employment or service. The stock bonus price per share was calculated based on last closing price as reported on per the OTCBB
prior to the grant date for a total of $75,100. Shares were set aside and reserved for this transaction. The Company accrued operating
expense ratably from the time of the awards through May 2, 2013, when vested. Of the 61,852 vested shares, only 5,185 have been
issued to-date. On April 29, 2016 the Board of Directors determined that is was not in the best interest of either the Company
or the recipients to pay bonuses based on the current and foreseeable share price and cancelled the bonuses payable. The results
of this action are included in a reduction of shares payable as reflected on the statement of stockholders  deficit and
the balance sheet.

As
                                         discussed under Footnote 13  Commitments and Contingencies , we are co-defendants
                                         under an action filed March 2015, in the Circuit Court of Broward County claiming personal
                                         injury resulting from the use of a Brownie s Third Lung product. As a result of
                                         a miscommunication with legal counsel a default has been entered against the Company
                                         in this action for failing to file a timely response. The Company has obtained different
                                         legal representation in this matter and attempted to have the default set aside. On November
                                         2, 2016, the court granted plaintiff s motion for sanctions against our company
                                         for frivolous litigation relating to our attempt to have the matter dismissed and granted

                                         default. The Company still believes the claim to be a Workers Compensation claim relating
                                         exclusively against another defendant and without merit, and plans to aggressively defend
                                         this action.

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016, as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Net
revenues . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had net revenues of $837,984 as compared to net revenues of $1,105,915
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $267,931 or 24% The decrease is primarily attributable to a decline
in high pressure sales. Overall sales of hookah systems and related products were up approximately $21,000
for the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015. Sales in tankfill systems and related products were down
by approximately $298,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to same period in 2015. The decline
in tankfill sales is primarily attributable to a single large tankfill sale in 2015 not repeated in 2016.  

Cost
of net revenues . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had cost of net revenues of $537,837 as compared with cost
of net revenues of $660,614 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $122,777 or 19%. The decrease during
the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to third quarter ended September 30, 2015, is primarily attributable to a
decrease in net revenues as discussed above coupled with the decrease in royalties expense.  

Gross
profit . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had a gross profit of $300,147 as compared to gross profit of $445,301
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $145,154 or 33%. The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable
to the decline in total net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to same period in 2015.  

Operating
expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had operating expenses of $161,929 as compared to operating
expenses of $194,539 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $32,600 or 17%. The decrease is
predominantly a result of a reduction of the workforce and associated taxes, insurances and benefits between the third quarter
of 2016 and the third quarter 2015.  

Other
(income) expense, net . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had other expense, net of $5,060 as compared to other
expense, net of $3,264 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1,796. This account is comprised of other
(income) expense, net; and interest expense. Other (income) expense, net, is comprised of transactions that are generally of a
non-recurring nature. The $1,796 overall difference between periods is primarily comprised of no individually significant items
in the third quarter of 2016. Other income of $3,264 in the third quarter of 2015 was comprised of no individually significant
items. Interest expense decreased by $1,535 reflecting a decline in notes payable between the periods.  

Net
Income . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had net income of $133,148 as compared to net income of $247,498
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease in net income of $114,350 or 46%. The decrease in net
income is primarily attributable to the decrease in net revenues as discussed above.  

Results
of Operations for the Nine months ended September 30, 2016, as Compared to the Nine months ended September 30, 2015   

Net
revenues . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had net revenues of $1,875,276 as compared to net revenues of $2,281,636
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $406,360 or 18%. While sales of hookah systems were relatively
flat for the period, the decrease is primarily attributable to a single large tankfill sale in 2015. There was no similar
tankfill transaction in 2016. Overall sales of hookah systems and related products were up approximately $8,700
for the first three quarters of 2016, compared to the first three quarters of 2015. Sales in tankfill systems and related products
were down by approximately $403,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to same period in 2015 primarily
due to a single large tankfill sale in 2015 not repeated in 2016.  

Cost
of net revenues . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had cost of net revenues of $1,325,138 as compared with
cost of net revenues of $1,494,807 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $169,669 or 11%. The decrease during
the first three quarters ended September 30, 2016 compared to first three quarters ended September 30, 2015, is primarily attributable
to a decrease in material costs of approximately $159,863 due to the decrease in net revenues and a sales related reduction in
royalty expense.  

Gross
profit . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a gross profit of $550,138 as compared to gross profit of $786,829
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $236,691 or 30%. The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable
to the decline in total net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to same period in 2015.  

Operating
expenses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had operating expenses of $476,369 as compared to operating
expenses of $533,879 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $57,510 or 11%. The decrease is
predominantly a result of a reduction of the workforce and associated taxes, insurances and benefits between the first three quarters
of 2016 and the first three quarters of 2015.  

Other
(income) expense, net . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had other income, net of $250,294 as compared to other
expense, net of $24,229 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $274,523. This account is comprised of other
(income) expense, net; and interest expense. Other (income) expense, net, is comprised of transactions that are generally of a
non-recurring nature. The $274,523 overall difference between periods is primarily comprised of the $93,459 debt settlement of
a convertible debenture and its associated interest and the $140,366 from the cancelation of incentive bonuses payable in the
second quarter of 2016. Other (income) expense of $24,229 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was comprised of no individually
significant items. Interest expense decreased by $4,670 reflecting a decline in notes payable between the periods.  

Net
Income . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had net income of $324,063 as compared to net income of $228,678
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase in net income of $95,385. The increase in net income is primarily
attributable to the $93,459 in other income recognized in the write-off of a convertible debenture and $140,366 cancelation of
incentive bonuses as described above.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Changes
in the Company s working capital at September 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015 are predominately due to the cancelation of
debt from convertible debentures and incentive retention bonuses. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and current assets
(primarily consisting of inventory) of $1,079,244 and current liabilities of $978,828 or a current ratio of 1.1 to 1. This
represents a working capital surplus of $100,416. This compares to a working capital deficit of $274,942 at December 31,
2015.  

The
condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as
a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business
for the twelve-month period following the date of these financial statements. Although we had net income for the years ended December
31, 2014 and 2015 and for the three and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2016, we have otherwise incurred annual losses
since 2009, and expect we may have more losses in future periods.  

The
Company is behind on payments due for matured convertible debentures; related party notes payable; accrued liabilities and interest
  related parties; and certain vendor payables. The Company is handling delinquencies on a case by case basis. However,
there can be no assurance that cooperation the Company has received thus far will continue.  

The
Company does not expect that existing cash flow will be sufficient to fund presently anticipated operations. This raises substantial
doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern during the twelve- month period following the date of the financial statements
included herein. The Company will need to raise additional funds and is currently exploring alternative sources of financing.
We have issued a number of convertible debentures as an interim measure to finance our working capital needs. We have historically
paid for some legal and consulting services with restricted stock to maximize working capital and intend to continue this practice
in the future when possible. We have implemented some cost saving measures and will continue to explore more to reduce operating
expenses.  

If
we fail to raise additional funds when needed, or do not have sufficient cash flows from sales, we may be required to scale back
or cease operations, liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Certain
Business Risks   

The
Company is subject to various risks, which may materially harm its business, financial condition and results of operations. You
should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this report before deciding
to purchase the Company s common stock. These are not the only risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. If any of
these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the Company s business, financial condition or operating results could be
materially harmed. In that case, the trading price of the Company s common stock could decline and you could lose all or
part of your investment.   

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt absent obtaining adequate new debt or equity financing and achieving
sufficient sales levels.  

Although
we had net income of $324,063 (inclusive of $250,294 in non-recurring other income) and $229,610 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, we anticipate that losses may occur in the foreseeable future.
Additionally, the Company has negative cash flows from operations, is behind on payments due for matured convertible debentures,
related party notes payable, accrued liabilities and interest  related parties, and certain vendor payables. The Company
is working out all matters of delinquency on a case by case basis. However, there can be no assurance that cooperation the Company
has received thus far will continue. This raises a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continued
existence is dependent upon generating working capital and obtaining adequate new debt or equity financing. Because of our historical
operational losses, we may not have working capital to permit us to remain in business during the twelve- month period following
the date of the financial statements included herein, without improvements in our cash flow from operations or new financing.
Working capital limitations continue to impinge on our day-to-day operations, thus contributing to continued operating losses.  

The
optional conversion features of a series of convertible debentures issued by the Company could require the Company to issue a
substantial number of shares of common stock, which will cause dilution to the Company s stockholders and a potentially
negative effect on our stock price.  

Since
October 4, 2010 the Company has issued convertible debentures to several lenders and other third parties. At September 30, 2016,
the outstanding principal balance of these debentures was $312,743. The debentures convert under various conversion formulas,
many of which may be at a significant discount to market price of our common stock. The conversion of any of the debentures will
result in the issuance of a significant number of shares of our common stock, which will cause dilution to our existing shareholders.
Furthermore, the conversion at a significant discount to the market price of our common stock may have a negative effect on our
stock price.  

Our
common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and may fluctuate significantly.  

Our
common stock is traded on the Over-the-Counter Markets. There is a limited public market for our common stock and there can be
no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will develop. As a result, this could adversely affect our shareholders 
ability to sell our common stock in short time periods, or possibly at all. Thinly traded common stock can be more volatile than
common stock traded in an active public market. Our common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant
price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating
performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall
economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.  

Our
company is a voluntary filer with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in the event that we cease reporting under the Exchange
Act, investors would have limited information available to them about the company.  

While
we are subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, we do not have a class of securities registered under Section 12(g) of the
Exchange Act. To the extent that our duty to file Exchange Act reports has automatically suspended under Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, as a voluntary filer, we may elect to cease reporting under the Exchange Act at such time, which would limit the
information available to investors and shareholders about the company.  

Our
common stock is deemed to be  penny stock,  which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares due
to suitability requirements  

Our
common stock is deemed to be  penny stock  as that term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Penny
stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities
exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such
securities is provided by the exchange or system). Our common stock is covered by an SEC rule that imposes additional sales practice
requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors,
which are generally institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000, or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or
annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.  

Broker/dealers
dealing in penny stocks are required to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks. Moreover,
broker/dealers are required to determine whether an investment in a penny stock is a suitable investment for a prospective investor.
These requirements may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of potential investors. This may
make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. This
could cause our stock price to decline.  

We
depend on the services of our Chief Executive Officer  

Our
success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of Robert M. Carmichael, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Carmichael
has been instrumental in securing our existing financing arrangements. Mr. Carmichael is primarily responsible for the development
of our technology and the design of our products. The loss of the services of Mr. Carmichael could materially harm our business
because of the cost and time necessary to recruit and train a replacement. Such a loss would also divert management attention
away from operational issues. We do not presently maintain a key-man life insurance policy on Mr. Carmichael.  

We
require additional personnel and could fail to attract or retain key personnel  

We
are currently utilizing the services of professional consultants in the absence of a Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations
Officer. The loss of the services of these consultants prior to our ability to attract and retain a Chief Financial Officer or
Chief Operations Officer may have a material adverse effect upon us. Also, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain
our existing personnel or attract additional qualified associates in the future.  

Our
failure to obtain intellectual property and enforce protection would have a material adverse effect on our business  

Our
success depends in part on our ability, and the ability of our patent and trademark licensors, entities owned and controlled by
Robert M. Carmichael, our President and Chief Executive Officer, to obtain and defend our intellectual property, including patent
protection for our products and processes, preserve our trade secrets, defend and enforce our rights against infringement and
operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Despite
our efforts to protect our intellectual proprietary rights, existing copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited
protection.  

Our
industry is characterized by frequent intellectual property litigation based on allegations of infringement of intellectual property
rights. Although we are not aware of any intellectual property claims against us, we may be a party to litigation in the future.  

We
may be unable to manage growth  

Successful
implementation of our business strategy requires us to manage our growth. Growth could place an increasing strain on our management
and financial resources. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition or operating results could
be materially harmed, and our stock price may decline.  

Reliance
on vendors and manufacturers  

We
deal with suppliers on an order-by order basis and have no long-term purchase contracts or other contractual assurances of continued
supply or pricing. In addition, we have no long-term contracts with our manufacturing sources and compete with other companies
for production facility capacity. Historically, we have purchased enough inventories of products or their substitutes to satisfy
demand. However, unanticipated failure of any manufacturer or supplier to meet our requirements or our inability to build or obtain
substitutes could force us to curtail or cease operations.  

Dependence
on consumer spending  

The
success of the our business depends largely upon a number of factors related to consumer spending, including current and future
economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment, business conditions, tax rates, and interest rates.
In times of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which affect demand for our products.
Any significant deterioration in overall economic conditions that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income can reduce
our sales and adversely affect our financial results. The impact of weakening consumer credit markets; layoffs; corporate restructurings;
higher fuel prices; declines in the value of investments and residential real estate; and increases in federal and state taxation
can all negatively affect our results. There can be no assurance that in this type of environment consumer spending will not decline
beyond current levels, thereby adversely affecting our growth, net sales and profitability or that our business will not be adversely
affected by continuing or future downturns in the economy, boating industry, or dive industry. If declines in consumer spending
on recreational marine accessories and dive gear are other than temporary, we could be forced to curtail operations.  

Government
regulations may impact us  

The
SCUBA industry is self-regulating; therefore, Brownie s is not subject to government industry specific regulation. Nevertheless,
Brownie s strives to be a leader in promoting safe diving practices within the industry and is at the forefront of self-regulation
through responsible diving practices. Brownie s is subject to all regulations applicable to  for profit  companies
as well as all trade and general commerce governmental regulation. All required federal and state permits, licenses, and bonds
to operate its facility have been obtained. There can be no assurance that our operations will not be subject to more restrictive
regulations in the future, which could force us to curtail or cease operations.  

Bad
weather conditions could have an adverse effect on operating results  

Our
business is significantly impacted by weather patterns. Unseasonably cool weather, extraordinary amounts of rainfall, or unseasonably
rough surf, may decrease boat use and diving, thereby decreasing sales. Accordingly, our results of operations for any prior period
may not be indicative of results of any future period.  

Investors
should not rely on an investment in our stock for the payment of cash dividends  

We
have not paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future. Investors
should not make an investment in our common stock if they require dividend income. Any return on an investment in our common stock
will be as a result of any appreciation, if any, in our stock price.  

The
manufacture and distribution of recreational diving equipment could result in product liability claims and we currently lack product
liability insurance  

We,
like any other retailer, distributor and manufacturer of products that are designed for recreational sporting purposes, face an
inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in injury. Such claims
may include, among other things, that our products are designed and/or manufactured improperly or fail to include adequate instructions
as to proper use and/or side effects, if any. We do not anticipate obtaining contractual indemnification from parties-supplying
raw materials, manufacturing our products or marketing our products. In any event, any such indemnification if obtained will be
limited by our terms and, as a practical matter, to the credit worthiness of the indemnifying party. We currently do not have
any product liability insurance. In the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification, product liabilities
relating to defective products could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial conditions, which could force
us to curtail or cease our business operations. As previously disclosed, we are co-defendants under an action filed March 2015,
in the Circuit Court of Broward County claiming personal injury resulting from the use of a Brownie s Third Lung product.
This claim falls outside the Company s period of insurance coverage.

Not
Applicable to Smaller Reporting Company.  

Item
4.      Controls
and Procedures    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the  Exchange Act ) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation
of Robert Carmichael, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial (and principal accounting) Officer, carried
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016. Based upon that evaluation and the identification
of the material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as described below under  Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,  the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of the Company. Management,
with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, based on the criteria established in 2013 Internal Control
- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our internal control over financial
reporting is not effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles because of the
Company s limited resources and limited number of employees. To mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees,
we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of legal and accounting professionals. As we
grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the
internal control framework.  

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures  

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations
include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act that occurred
during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

See
Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies to the financial statements included in this report for a discussion of outstanding litigation
proceedings.  

As
disclosed under Note 13, we are co-defendants under an action filed March 2015, in the Circuit Court of Broward County claiming
personal injury resulting from the use of a Brownie s Third Lung product. As a result of a miscommunication with legal counsel
a default has been entered against the Company in this action for failing to file a timely response. We have attempted to have
the default set aside. On November 2, 2016, the court granted plaintiff s motion for sanctions against our company for frivolous
litigation relating to our attempt to have the matter dismissed and granted the plaintiff s motion to strike our motion
for summary judgment due to our initial default. The Company still believes the claim to be a Workers Compensation claim relating
exclusively against another defendant and without merit, and plans to aggressively defend this action.

disclosed on Form 8-K. The securities issued with a legend restricting their transferability absent registration of applicable
exemption.  

During
the period covered by this report, $572 related party interest payable to Robert Carmichael, our Chief Executive Officer, was
converted to 124,326 shares of restricted stock.  

Effective
