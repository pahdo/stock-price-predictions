  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (unaudited) 

Note 1         Significant Accounting Policies    
    
  Interim Financial Statements.   The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Brunswick Corporation (Brunswick or the Company) have been prepared pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations. Therefore, certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements and related notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted. As stated in   Note 2       Discontinued Operations  , Brunswick's results as discussed in the financial statements reflect continuing operations only, unless otherwise noted.  
    
  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with, and have been prepared in conformity with, the accounting principles reflected in the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Brunswick s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the 2015 Form 10-K). These results include, in management's opinion, all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly Brunswick's financial position as of   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   October 3, 2015  , the results of operations for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , and the cash flows for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  . Due to the seasonality of Brunswick s businesses, the interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the remainder of the year. 
    
  The Company maintains its financial records on the basis of a fiscal year ending on December 31, with the fiscal quarters spanning approximately   thirteen   weeks. The first quarter ends on the Saturday closest to the end of the first   thirteen  -week period. The second and third quarters are   thirteen   weeks in duration and the fourth quarter is the remainder of the year. The first three quarters of fiscal year   2016   ended on   April 2, 2016  ,   July 2, 2016   and   October 1, 2016  , and the first three quarters of fiscal year   2015   ended on   April 4, 2015  ,   July 4, 2015   and   October 3, 2015  .  
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements.   The following are recent accounting pronouncements that have been adopted during   2016  , or will be adopted in future periods. 
    
  Statement of Cash Flows Classifications  : In August 2016, the   Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)   amended the   Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)   to add and/or clarify guidance on the classification of certain transactions in the statement of cash flows. The amendment is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and the interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the approach it will use to apply the new standard and the impact it will have on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
    
  Share-Based Compensation  : In March 2016, the FASB amended the ASC to simplify the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. Amendments related to the timing of excess tax benefit recognition, minimum statutory withholding requirements and forfeitures will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Amendments to certain classifications on the statement of cash flows may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively, and amendments     requiring the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement are to be applied prospectively.   These amendments are to be applied for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the approach it will use to apply the new standard and the impact that the adoption of the new standard will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.    
    
  Recognition of Leases  : In February 2016, the FASB amended the ASC to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Lessees will recognize expenses similar to current lease accounting. The amendment is to be applied using a modified retrospective method with certain practical expedients, and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the approach it will use to apply the new standard and the impact that the adoption of the new standard will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.  
       
  Classification of Deferred Income Taxes  : In November 2015, the FASB amended the ASC to require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. The amendment may be applied either retrospectively or prospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and the interim periods thereafter, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (unaudited) 

The Company early adopted this ASC amendment during the first quarter of 2016 which caused the Company to change its method of presentation for current deferred income taxes in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. Current deferred income tax assets of   $180.5 million   and   $207.8 million   as of   December 31, 2015   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively, were reclassified to long-term. 
    
  Measurement of Inventory  : In July 2015, the FASB issued final guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. The guidance applies to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than LIFO and the retail inventory method. The amendment is to be applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and the interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASC amendment, but does not expect it will have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Fair Value Disclosure  : In May 2015, the FASB amended the ASC to update the presentation of certain investments measured at net asset value within the fair value hierarchy. The amendment requires these investments to be removed from the fair value hierarchy categorization and presented as a single reconciling line item between the fair value of investments reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the amounts reported in the fair value hierarchy table. The amendment is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and the interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this amendment in 2016 and it did not have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Revenue Recognition  : In May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued a final standard on revenue recognition which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. This standard will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. Under the new standard, entities are required to identify the contract with a customer; identify the separate performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and recognize the appropriate amount of revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies each performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB amended the ASC to delay the effective date to fiscal years, and the interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2018, from the original effective date of January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted no earlier than January 1, 2017. Entities have the option of using either retrospective transition or a modified approach in applying the new standard. The Company is currently evaluating the approach it will use to apply the new standard and the impact that the adoption of the new standard will have on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 3       Restructuring and Integration Activities    
    
  The Company acquired Cybex International, Inc. (Cybex) and Indoor Cycling Group GmbH (ICG) in the first and third quarters of   2016  , respectively, as discussed in   Note 4    Acquisitions  , and executed certain restructuring and integration activities within the Fitness segment related to these acquisitions, resulting in the recognition of restructuring and integration charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during   2016  . 
    
  The following table is a summary of the expense associated with the Fitness segment restructuring and integration activities for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , as discussed above:

During   2016  , the Company made cash payments of   $7.5 million   relating to all restructuring and integration activities, including payments related to prior period restructuring activities. As of   October 1, 2016  , accruals remaining for all restructuring and integration activities totaled   $2.8 million   and are expected to be paid substantially during   2016   and   2017  . 

Note 4       Acquisitions    
       
  On August 31, 2016, the Company acquired   100   percent of ICG, a market leader specializing in the design of indoor cycling equipment, which is based in Nuremburg, Germany. The addition of ICG strengthens the Company's position in indoor cycling and provides a strong foundation to expand in the growing group exercise market. ICG is managed as part of the Company's Fitness segment. 
    
  The Company acquired ICG for total consideration of   $54.1 million  , including   $51.7 million   of cash paid during the third quarter of 2016. The preliminary recording of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in   $20.4 million   of identifiable intangible assets, including customer relationships, trade names and patents and proprietary technology for   $11.2 million  ,   $6.0 million   and   $3.2 million  , respectively, along with   $26.0 million   for goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. The amounts assigned to ICG's customer relationships and patents and proprietary technology will be amortized over the estimated useful life of approximately   11 years   and   5 years  , respectively. These amounts recorded are preliminary and are subject to change within the measurement period as the Company finalizes its fair value estimates. 
    
  On July 1, 2016, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of privately held Thunder Jet Boats, Inc. (Thunder Jet), a designer and builder of heavy-gauge aluminum boats, which is based in Clarkston, Washington. Thunder Jet offers a lineup of 18 models ranging in length from 18-26 feet and adds breadth and depth to the Company's overall product portfolio. Thunder Jet is managed within the Company's Boat segment.  
    
  The cash consideration the Company paid to acquire Thunder Jet was   $20.9 million  . The preliminary recording of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in   $10.8 million   of identifiable intangible assets, including customer relationships and trade names for   $5.4 million   each, along with   $2.5 million   of goodwill which is deductible for tax purposes. The amount assigned to Thunder Jet's customer relationships will be amortized over the estimated useful life of   15 years  . These amounts are preliminary and are subject to change within the measurement period as the Company finalizes its fair value estimates. 
    
  On January 20, 2016, the Company acquired   100   percent of privately held Cybex, a leading manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment, which is currently based in Medway, Massachusetts. Cybex offers a full line of cardiovascular and strength products and had unaudited sales in 2015 of approximately   $169 million  . The addition of Cybex expands the Fitness segment's participation in key markets, including commercial fitness, and adds to the Company's manufacturing footprint to meet current and future demand more effectively. Cybex also increases the breadth and depth of the segment's product portfolio. Cybex is managed within the Company's Fitness segment.

The following table is a summary of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and net cash consideration paid for the Cybex  acquisition during     2016  : 

(A) The goodwill recorded for the acquisition of Cybex is not deductible for tax purposes. 
  (B) These amounts are subject to change within the measurement period as the Company finalizes its fair value estimates. 
  (C) Net cash consideration paid includes a purchase price adjustment of   $1.9 million   in the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  These acquisitions are not material to the Company's net sales, results of operations or total assets during any period presented. Accordingly, the Company's consolidated results from operations do not differ materially from historical performance as a result of these acquisitions and, therefore, pro forma results are not presented.  

Note 5       Financial Instruments    
    
  The Company operates globally with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around the world. Due to the Company s global operations, the Company engages in activities involving both financial and market risks. The Company utilizes normal operating and financing activities, along with derivative financial instruments, to minimize these risks. 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments.   The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its risks associated with movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Derivative instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking each hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific forecasted transactions. The Company also assesses, both at the hedge s inception and monthly thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the anticipated cash flows of the hedged item. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective, or it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively and immediately recognizes the gains and losses associated with those hedges. There were no material adjustments to the results of operations for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   as a result of ineffectiveness. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined through market-based valuations and may not be representative of the actual gains or losses that will be recorded when these instruments mature due to future fluctuations in the markets in which they are traded. The effects of derivative financial instruments are not expected to be material to the Company s financial position or results of operations when considered together with the underlying exposure being hedged. Use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to credit risk with its counterparties when the fair value of a derivative contract is an asset. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into derivative contracts with highly rated counterparties. The maximum amount of loss due to counterparty credit risk is limited to the asset value of derivative financial instruments. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges.   The Company enters into certain derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The Company executes both forward and option contracts, based on forecasted transactions, to manage foreign currency exchange exposure mainly related to inventory purchase and sales transactions. The Company also enters into commodity swap agreements based on anticipated purchases of copper and natural gas to manage risk related to price changes. From time-to-time, the Company enters into forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of debt.

  BRUNSWICK CORPORATION 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (unaudited) 

A cash flow hedge requires that as changes in the fair value of derivatives occur, the portion of the change deemed to be effective is recorded temporarily in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, an equity account, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of   October 1, 2016  , the term of derivative instruments hedging forecasted transactions ranged from one to 15 months.  
    
  Fair Value Hedges.   From time-to-time, the Company enters into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to convert a portion of the Company's long-term debt from fixed to floating rate debt. An interest rate swap is entered into with the expectation that the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap will offset the change in the fair value of the debt instrument attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. Each period, the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap asset or liability is recorded in debt and the difference between the fixed interest payment and floating interest receipts is recorded as a net adjustment to interest expense. 
    
  Other Hedging Activity.   The Company has entered into certain foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. These contracts are used to manage foreign currency exposure related to changes in the value of assets or liabilities caused by changes in foreign exchange rates. The change in the fair value of the foreign currency derivative contract and the corresponding change in the fair value of the asset or liability of the Company are both recorded through earnings, each period as incurred. In addition, other hedging activity includes commodity swap agreements that are used to hedge purchases of aluminum. These hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting. The commodity swap agreements are based on anticipated purchases of aluminum and are used to manage risk related to price changes. The change in the fair value of the aluminum derivative contract is recorded through earnings, each period as incurred. 
    
  Foreign Currency.   The Company enters into forward and option contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure related to forecasted transactions and assets and liabilities that are subject to risk from foreign currency rate changes. These exposures include: product costs; revenues and expenses; associated receivables and payables; intercompany obligations and receivables; and other related cash flows. 
    
  Forward exchange contracts outstanding at   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   October 3, 2015   had notional contract values of   $248.9 million  ,   $273.5 million   and   $276.6 million  , respectively. Option contracts outstanding at   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   October 3, 2015   had notional contract values of   $39.3 million  ,   $51.0 million   and   $42.7 million  , respectively. The forward and options contracts outstanding at   October 1, 2016   mature during   2016   and   2017   and mainly relate to the Euro, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona, Brazilian real, British pound, Norwegian krone, Mexican peso, Hungarian forint and New Zealand dollar. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company estimates that during the next 12 months, it will reclassify approximately   $0.1 million   of net losses (based on current rates) from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Cost of sales. 
    
  Interest Rate.   The Company enters into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to convert a portion of the Company's long-term debt from fixed to floating rate debt. As of   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   October 3, 2015  , the outstanding swaps had notional contract values of   $200.0 million  , of which   $150.0 million   corresponds to the Company's   4.625   percent Senior notes due 2021 and   $50.0 million   corresponds to the Company's   7.375   percent Debentures due 2023. These instruments have been designated as fair value hedges, with the fair value recorded in long-term debt. 
    
  The Company also enters into forward-starting interest rate swaps from time-to-time to hedge the interest rate risk associated with anticipated debt issuances. There were no forward-starting interest rate swaps outstanding at   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   or   October 3, 2015  .  
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   October 3, 2015  , the Company had   $4.8 million  ,   $5.1 million   and   $5.1 million  , respectively, of net deferred losses associated with all settled forward-starting interest rate swaps, which were included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company estimates that during the next 12 months, it will reclassify approximately   $1.1 million   of net losses resulting from settled forward-starting interest rate swaps from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Interest expense. 
    
  Commodity Price.   The Company uses commodity swaps to hedge anticipated purchases of aluminum, copper and natural gas. Commodity swap contracts outstanding at   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   October 3, 2015   had notional contract values of   $2.3 million  ,   $10.8 million   and   $14.3 million  , respectively. The contracts outstanding mature through 2016. The amount of gain or loss associated with the change in fair value of these instruments is either recorded through earnings each period as incurred or, if designated as cash flow hedges, deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in Cost of sales in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company estimates that

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments.   The carrying values of the Company s short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable and short-term debt approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. At   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   October 3, 2015  , the fair value of the Company s long-term debt was approximately   $485.4 million  ,   $454.7 million   and   $462.8 million  , respectively, and was determined using Level 1 and Level 2 inputs described in   Note 6       Fair Value Measurements  , including quoted market prices or discounted cash flows based on quoted market rates for similar types of debt. The carrying value of long-term debt, including current maturities, was   $447.9 million  ,   $448.5 million   and   $453.1 million   as of   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively. 

Note 6       Fair Value Measurements    
    
  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  There is a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable. 

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 - Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  These are typically obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments.    

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs, where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability.  These inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions of the data that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available in the circumstances.

Note 7       Share-Based Compensation    
    
  Under the Brunswick Corporation 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), non-vested stock awards and performance awards to executives, other employees and non-employee directors from treasury shares and from authorized, but unissued, shares of common stock, in addition to any shares reacquired by the Company through the forfeiture of past awards, or settlement of such awards in cash. As of   October 1, 2016  ,   5.5 million   shares remained available for grant. 
    
  Non-vested stock awards 
    
  The Company grants both stock-settled and cash-settled non-vested stock units and awards to key employees as determined by management and the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company did not grant stock awards during the   three   months ended   October 1, 2016   or   October 3, 2015  . The Company granted   0.3 million   and   0.2 million   of stock awards during the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively. The Company recognizes the cost of non-vested stock units and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  Additionally, cash-settled non-vested stock units and awards are recorded as a liability in the balance sheet and adjusted to fair value each reporting period through stock compensation expense. During the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , the Company charged   $2.9 million   and   $7.4 million  , respectively, and charged   $3.1 million   and   $10.1 million   during the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015  , respectively, to compensation expense for non-vested stock awards.  
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , there was   $9.3 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements.  The Company expects this cost to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.2 year  s. 
    
  Performance awards 
    
  In the first nine months of both   2016   and   2015  , the Company granted   0.1 million   performance shares to certain senior executives. The   2016   and   2015   share awards are based on three performance measures: a cash flow return on investment (CFROI) measure, an operating margin (OM) measure and a total shareholder return (TSR) modifier. Performance shares are earned based on a three-year performance period commencing at the beginning of the calendar year of each grant. The performance shares are then subject to a TSR modifier based on stock returns measured against stock returns of a predefined comparator group over a three-year  
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  
  BRUNSWICK CORPORATION 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (unaudited) 

performance period which starts at the beginning of the calendar year of each grant.  Additionally, in February   2016   and   2015  , the Company granted   37,430   and   22,990   performance shares, respectively, to certain officers and certain senior managers based on the respective measures and performance periods described above but excluding a TSR modifier. Based on projections of probable attainment of the performance measures and the projected TSR modifier used to determine the performance awards,   $1.4 million   and   $4.4 million   was charged to compensation expense for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively. In the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015  ,   $2.0 million   and   $5.2 million  , respectively, was charged to compensation expense based on projections of profitable attainment of the performance measures and the projected TSR modifier used to determine the performance awards. 
    
  The fair values of the senior executives' performance share award grants with a TSR modifier at the grant date in   2016   and   2015   were   $38.54   and   $56.17  , respectively, which were estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation model, and incorporated the following assumptions: 

The fair value of the certain officers' and certain senior managers' performance awards granted based solely on the CFROI and OM performance factors was   $37.76   and   $52.39  , respectively, which was equal to the stock price on the date of grant in   2016   and   2015  , respectively, less the present value of dividend payments over the vesting period. 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had   $3.8 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to performance awards. The Company expects this cost to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.0   years. 
    
  Director Awards 
    
  The Company issues stock awards to non-employee directors in accordance with the terms and conditions determined by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors.  A portion of each director s annual fee is paid in Brunswick common stock, the receipt of which may be deferred until a director retires from the Board of Directors.  Each director may elect to have the remaining portion paid in cash, in Brunswick common stock distributed at the time of the award or in deferred Brunswick common stock with a   20 percent   premium.

Note 8       Earnings per Common Share     
    
  Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding as well as certain vested, unissued equity awards during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated similarly, except that the calculation includes the dilutive effect of stock-settled SARs, non-vested stock awards and performance awards. 
    
  Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   were calculated as follows: 

As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had   1.2 million   SARs outstanding and exercisable. This compares with   2.3 million   SARs outstanding, of which   2.2 million   were exercisable, as of   October 3, 2015  . During both the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , there were no SARs outstanding for which the exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company s shares for the period then ended. Therefore, there were no non-dilutive SARs to exclude from the computation of diluted earnings per common share. Changes in average outstanding basic shares from   October 3, 2015   to   October 1, 2016   reflect the impact of common stock repurchases throughout 2015 and the first nine months of 2016, net of the impact of SARs exercised and the vesting of stock and performance awards since the beginning of 2015. 

Note 9       Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  Financial Commitments 
    
  The Company has entered into guarantees of indebtedness of third parties, primarily in connection with customer financing programs.  Under these arrangements, the Company has guaranteed customer obligations to the financial institutions in the event of customer default, generally subject to a maximum amount that is less than total outstanding obligations.  The Company has also extended guarantees to third parties that have purchased customer receivables from the Company and, in certain instances, has guaranteed secured term financing of its customers. Potential payments in connection with these customer financing arrangements generally extend over several years. In most instances, upon repurchase of the receivable or note, the Company receives rights to the collateral securing the financing.   
    
  The Company has also entered into arrangements with third-party lenders in which it has agreed, in the event of a customer default, to repurchase from the third-party lender those Brunswick products repossessed from the customer. These arrangements  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  
  BRUNSWICK CORPORATION 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (unaudited) 

are typically subject to a maximum repurchase amount.  The Company s risk under these repurchase arrangements is partially mitigated by the value of the products repurchased as part of the transaction.   
    
  The Company has recorded its estimated net liability associated with losses from these guarantee and repurchase obligations on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances.  Historical cash requirements and losses associated with these obligations have not been significant, but could increase if dealer defaults exceed current expectations. 
    
  There were no material changes during the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   to the financial commitments that were discussed in Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Form 10-K.    
    
  Product Warranties 
    
  The Company records a liability for product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. The liability is estimated using historical warranty experience, projected claim rates and expected costs per claim. The Company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and the exposure can be estimated. Product failure rates as well as material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure affect the Company's warranty liabilities. If actual costs differ from estimated costs, the Company must make a revision to the warranty liability. Changes in the Company's warranty liabilities due to improvements in the Company's experience and adjustments related to changes in estimates are included as Aggregate changes for preexisting warranties presented in the table below. 
    
  The following activity related to product warranty liabilities was recorded in Accrued expenses during the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  :  

Additionally, end users of the Company's products may purchase a contract from the Company that extends product warranty beyond the standard period. For certain extended warranty contracts in which the  Company retains the warranty or administration obligation, a deferred liability is recorded based on the aggregate sales price for contracts sold.  The deferred liability is reduced and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period during which costs are expected to be incurred. Deferred revenue associated with contracts sold by the Company that extend product protection beyond the standard product warranty period, not included in the table above, was   $87.0 million  ,   $78.3 million   and   $77.3 million   at   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively, and is recorded in Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities. 
    
  Legal and Environmental 
    
  The Company accrues for litigation exposure when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period they are identified. Management does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for the Company s litigation claims and matters, if any, has been incurred. However, the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable. In light of existing reserves, the Company's litigation claims, when finally resolved, are not expected, in management's opinion, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  There were no material changes during the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   to the legal and environmental commitments that were discussed in Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Form 10-K.

Note 13     Income Taxes     
    
  The Company recognized an income tax provision from continuing operations for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   of   $32.8 million   and   $109.1 million  , respectively, which included net tax benefits of    $3.2 million   and   $3.3 million  , respectively, mainly associated with the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments. The Company recognized an income tax provision from continuing operations for the   three   months ended   October 3, 2015   of   $39.7 million  , which included a net charge of   $0.8 million  , mainly associated with the change in estimates for prior period tax returns. The Company recognized an income tax provision from continuing operations for the   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015   of   $110.6 million  , which included a net benefit of    $8.4 million   mainly associated with the internal restructuring of foreign entities and the completion of the 2011 and 2012 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits. The effective tax rate from continuing operations, which is calculated as the income tax provision as a percentage of pre-tax income, for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   was   27.8   percent and   29.8   percent, respectively. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015   was   35.5   percent and   31.9   percent, respectively. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2015, the Company initiated an internal restructuring of its foreign entities, including the establishment of a European holding company. This restructuring is being undertaken to more effectively and efficiently manage the Company's foreign cash. The Company continued to implement this internal restructuring during the first nine months of 2016. 
    
  No deferred income taxes have been provided as of   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   or   October 3, 2015   on the applicable undistributed earnings of the non-U.S. subsidiaries where the indefinite reinvestment assertion has been applied. If at some future date these earnings cease to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding and other taxes on such amounts. The Company continues to provide deferred taxes, as required, on the undistributed net earnings of foreign subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates that are not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States. 
    
  As of   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   October 3, 2015  , the Company had   $3.8 million  ,   $4.8 million   and   $5.0 million   of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, respectively.  The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of   October 1, 2016   could decrease by approximately   $1.2 million   in the next   12

months due to settlements with taxing authorities or lapses in the statute of limitations.  Due to the various jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns and the uncertainty regarding the timing of the settlement of tax audits, it is possible that there could be other changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in   2016  , but the amount cannot be estimated. 
    
  The Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The Company has been audited by the IRS through the 2012 tax year and all open issues have been resolved. The Company is currently open to tax examinations by the IRS for the 2014 and 2015 tax years. The IRS has notified the Company that it intends to audit the 2014 tax year. Primarily as a result of filing amended returns, which were generated by the closing of federal income tax audits, the Company is still open to state and local tax audits in major tax jurisdictions dating back to the 2008 taxable year. Following the completion in the fourth quarter of 2015 of the 2008 through 2012 Germany tax audit, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by any major foreign tax jurisdiction for years prior to 2013, except for potential 2012 affirmative claims in Germany. 

Note 14       Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits     
    
  The Company has defined contribution plans, qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all of its employees. The Company's contributions to its defined contribution plans include a match and an annual discretionary contribution and are based on various percentages of compensation, and in some instances are based on the amount of the employees' contributions to the plans. See Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the   2015   Form 10-K for further details regarding these plans.  
    
  Pension and other postretirement benefit costs included the following components for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  : 

Portions of Net pension and other benefit costs are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses as well as capitalized into inventory. Costs capitalized into inventory are eventually realized through Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.  
    
  Pension expense in 2016 includes the impact of a change in methodology used to calculate the interest cost component of pension expense. In 2015 and prior years, the Company used a single-weighted average discount rate to calculate pension and postretirement interest costs. Beginning in 2016, the Company is utilizing a "spot rate approach" in the calculation of pension and postretirement interest costs to provide a more accurate measurement of interest costs. The spot rate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension and postretirement interest costs. This calculation change is considered to be a change in accounting estimate and is being applied prospectively in 2016. The discount rates used to measure the   2016   interest costs are   3.58%   and   3.30%   for pensions and other postretirement benefits, respectively. The previous method would have used a discount rate for interest costs of   4.40%   for pensions and   4.23%   for other postretirement benefits, respectively. The decreased interest costs for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , for pension is approximately   $2.0 million   and   $6.0 million  , respectively, compared with the previous method. The decreased interest costs for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , for other postretirement benefits, is approximately   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, compared with the previous method. Additionally, pension expense in 2016 includes the impact of a decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets, to   5.25%   in 2016 compared with   6.00%   in 2015, primarily due to shifts in asset allocations toward fixed income investments. For the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , pension expense increased by   $1.4 million   and   $4.2 million  , respectively, compared with the previous period as a result of the lower assumed rate of return on plan assets.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  Certain statements in Management s Discussion and Analysis are based on non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, the discussion of Brunswick Corporation's (Brunswick or the Company) cash flows includes an analysis of free cash flows and total liquidity, the discussion of the Company's net sales includes comparisons of net sales on a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions, and the discussion of the Company's earnings includes comparisons of diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted. A  non-GAAP financial measure  is a numerical measure of a registrant s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of comprehensive income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and statistical measures. 
    
  The Company includes non-GAAP financial measures in Management s Discussion and Analysis, as Brunswick s management believes that these measures and the information they provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view Brunswick s performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate the Company s ongoing business performance. 
    
  Certain statements in Management s Discussion and Analysis are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from expectations as of the date of this filing because of factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A   Risk Factors in Brunswick s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the 2015 Form 10-K).  
    
  Brunswick does not provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial measures on a GAAP basis because it is unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. These items may include pension settlement charges, restructuring and integration costs, special tax items and certain other unusual adjustments. 
    
  Overview and Outlook 
    
  General 
    
  Net sales increased 10 percent during the   third   quarter of   2016   when compared with the   third   quarter of   2015   on both a GAAP basis and on a constant currency basis. On a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 6 percent over the comparative period.     Marine Engine segment net sales increased due to strong growth in the marine service, parts and accessories businesses as well as solid growth in outboard engines, partially offset by declines in sterndrive engines.     Boat segment net sales increased due to strong growth across all three primary boat categories (aluminum, sterndrive and inboard and fiberglass outboard). Fitness segment net sales increased, reflecting the benefit of recent acquisitions and strong overall growth in international markets. Revenues in the U.S. were flat as growth in health clubs and hospitality was offset by declines in sales to other channels, including retail and local and federal governments. International net sales for the Company increased 9 percent in the   third   quarter of   2016   on both a GAAP and constant currency basis when compared with the   third   quarter of   2015  , driven by increases in Europe, Canada and Asia-Pacific, partially offset by declines in other international markets. 
    
  Net sales during the first   nine   months of   2016   increased 9 percent when compared with the first   nine   months of   2015   on a GAAP basis, 10 percent on a constant currency basis and 6 percent on a constant currency basis excluding the impact of acquisitions.     The increases in net sales reflect the same factors for the quarterly period described above, except sales of sterndrive and inboard boats were up slightly and Fitness segment net sales increased in the U.S. International net sales increased 5 percent in the first   nine   months of   2016   on a GAAP basis when compared with the first   nine   months of 2015. On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 7 percent in the first   nine   months of   2016   due to the same factors described in the quarterly period above, except that Canadian sales were only up slightly. 
    
  Operating earnings in the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $122.5 million  , with an operating margin of   11.2   percent, which included restructuring and integration charges of   $2.4 million  . In the   third   quarter of   2015  , the Company reported operating earnings of   $115.8 million  , with an operating margin of   11.7   percent.     The increase in operating earnings during the   third   quarter of   2016   when compared with the   third   quarter of   2015   reflected the impact of higher net sales and savings related to cost reductions including benefits from sourcing initiatives and lower commodity costs. Partially offsetting these factors were planned investments in growth initiatives, restructuring and integration costs related to recent fitness acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 
    
  Operating earnings in the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $380.4 million  , with an operating margin of   11.2   percent, which included restructuring and integration charges of   $8.8 million  . In the first   nine   months of   2015  , the Company reported operating  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

earnings of   $358.7 million  , with an operating margin of   11.5   percent. The improvement in operating earnings during the first   nine    months of   2016   when compared with the first   nine   months of   2015   is due to the same factors as discussed in the quarterly period above. 
    
  The Company continues to expect that   2016   will be another year of outstanding earnings growth with excellent free cash flow generation. The Company is targeting approximately 10 percent net sales growth when compared with   2015   absent any significant changes in its global macroeconomic assumptions. Our plan reflects the continuation of solid market growth in the U.S. and Europe, the success of new products, which will result in market share gains, and increases from completed acquisitions. Acquisitions are estimated to account for 5 percentage points of the growth rate in   2016  , reflecting the impact of completed transactions in   2015   and   2016  . Despite lower than expected Cybex revenue contribution in 2016, the business remains on track to deliver an incremental $0.08 to diluted earnings per share, excluding planned restructuring and integration costs. These factors are expected to be partially offset by weakness in certain international marine markets and a slight unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
    
  The Company expects to have higher earnings before income taxes in   2016   resulting from increased revenue and slight improvements in both gross margin and operating margin levels, due to benefits from volume leverage, cost reductions and savings related to sourcing initiatives and net positive product mix factors, partially offset by incremental investments to support strategic objectives and foreign currency headwinds. The Company anticipates that operating earnings comparisons versus   2015   will be negatively affected by approximately $14 million, or 3.5 percent, due to foreign exchange rates, with a higher proportion of the impact recognized in the first half of   2016  . The Company projects operating expenses, including research and development expenses, to be higher in   2016   when compared with   2015   as the Company continues to increase investment spending to support growth. Operating expenses are projected to be slightly lower on a percentage of sales basis in   2016   versus   2015  . 
    
  The Company is also planning for its effective tax rate in   2016   to be 30 percent based on existing tax law which includes the benefit from optimizing its international legal entity and cash management structure as well as the permanent extension of the U.S. R D tax credit.

Matters Affecting Comparability 
    
  Certain events have occurred during the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   which the Company believes affect the comparability of the results of operations. The tables below summarize the impact of changes in currency exchange rates as well as the impact of recent acquisitions on the Company's net sales: 

Changes in Foreign Currency Rates.   Percentage changes in net sales expressed in constant currency are presented to reflect the impact that changes in currency exchange rates had on comparisons of net sales. To determine this information,   2016   net sales transacted in currencies other than U.S. dollars have been translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates from   2015   that were in effect during the comparative period. The percentage change in net sales expressed on a constant currency basis better reflects the changes in the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately 20 percent of the Company's annual net sales are transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's most material exposures include sales in Euros, Canadian dollars, Brazilian reais and Australian dollars.  
    
  Additionally, operating earnings comparisons were negatively affected by foreign exchange rates by approximately $2 million, or 2 percent, in the   third   quarter of   2016   when compared with the third quarter of   2015  . During the first nine months of   2016  , operating earnings comparisons were negatively affected by foreign exchange rates by approximately     $12 million, or 3 percent,     when compared with the same prior year period. These estimates include the impact of translation on all sales and costs transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, the impact of hedging activities and pricing actions in certain international markets in response to the stronger U.S. dollar. 
    
  Acquisitions.   The Company completed acquisitions throughout   2015   and during the first nine months of   2016   that affect the comparability of net sales. BLA, SCIFIT Systems, Inc. (SCIFIT) and Garelick Mfg. Co. (Garelick) were acquired in the second, third and fourth quarters of   2015  , respectively. Cybex, Thunder Jet and ICG were acquired in the first, second and third quarters of   2016  , respectively. Refer to   Note 4       Acquisitions   in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on acquisitions completed in   2016  ; refer to Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the   2015   Form 10-K for further details on   2015   acquisitions.

Restructuring and integration charges.   The Company recorded restructuring and integration charges of   $2.4 million   and   $8.8 million   in the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively, in the Fitness segment as a result of the Cybex and ICG acquisitions as discussed above. There were no comparable charges during 2015.     Refer to   Note 3       Restructuring and Integration Activities     for further information. The Company anticipates it will incur Restructuring and integration charges of approximately $12 million for the full year.

           (A) 
    Gross margin is defined as Net sales less Cost of sales as presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
       
  Net sales increased during the third quarter of 2016 when compared with the third quarter of 2015.     Marine Engine segment net sales increased due to strong growth in the marine service, parts and accessories businesses as well as solid growth in outboard engines. Both of these categories benefited from favorable market trends and market share gains. Net sales of sterndrive engines declined, reflecting unfavorable demand trends. Boat segment net sales increased due to strong growth across all three primary boat categories and benefited from strong increases in wholesale unit shipments.     Fitness segment net sales increased, reflecting the benefit of recent acquisitions and strong overall growth in international markets. Revenues in the U.S. were flat as growth in health clubs and hospitality was offset by declines in sales to other channels, including retail and local and federal governments.     International net sales for the Company increased 9 percent in the   third   quarter of   2016   on both a GAAP and constant currency basis when compared with the   third   quarter of   2015  , driven by increases in Europe, Canada and Asia-Pacific, partially offset by declines in other international markets. 
    
  Net sales during the first nine months of 2016 increased when compared with the first nine months of 2015. The increases in net sales reflect the same factors for the quarterly period described above, except sales of sterndrive and inboard boats and wholesale unit shipments were up slightly. Additionally, Fitness segment net sales increased in the U.S. International net sales increased 5

percent in the first   nine   months of   2016   on a GAAP basis when compared with the first   nine   months of 2015. On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 7 percent in the first   nine   months of   2016   due to the same factors described in the quarterly period above, except that Canadian sales were up slightly. 
    
  Gross margin percentage was down slightly in the third quarter of 2016 when compared with the same prior year period due     to a net unfavorable change in sales mix and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, which were mostly offset by volume increases and cost reductions including benefits from sourcing initiatives and lower commodity costs. In the first nine months of 2016, gross margin percentage increased as volume increases and cost reductions more than offset the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of net sales during the third quarter of 2016 when compared with the third quarter of 2015. Operating expenses increased due mostly to acquisitions and investments to support growth. In the first nine months of 2016, Selling, general and administrative expense increased when compared with the same prior year period due to the same factors described in the quarterly period above, but were flat on a percentage of net sales. 
    
  Research and development expense increased as a percentage of sales in the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2016 as the Company continued to increase its funding of investments in new products. 
    
  The Company recorded restructuring and integration charges of   $2.4 million   and   $8.8 million   for the three months and nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively. There were no restructuring and integration charges recorded in the first nine months of 2015.  
    
  The Company recorded   Equity earnings    of   $1.4 million   and   $3.2 million   in the three months and nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively, which were mainly related to the Company's marine joint ventures. This compares with   Equity earnings    of   $1.2 million   and   $3.2 million   recorded in the three months and nine months ended   October 3, 2015  , respectively. The Company recognized   $0.8 million   and   $1.7 million   in   Other income, net   in the three months and nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively. This compares with   $1.2 million   and   $4.4 million   recognized in   Other income, net   in the three months and nine months ended   October 3, 2015  , respectively. Other income, net includes the amortization of deferred income related to a trademark licensing agreement with AMF Bowling Centers, Inc as discussed in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the   2015   Form 10-K.  
    
  Net interest expense was up slightly for the three months and nine months ended   October 1, 2016   when compared with the same prior year period. 
    
  The Company recognized an income tax provision from continuing operations for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   of   $32.8 million   and   $109.1 million  , respectively, which included net tax benefits of   $3.2 million   and   $3.3 million  , respectively, mainly associated with the reassessment of tax reserves and favorable valuation allowance adjustments. The Company recognized an income tax provision from continuing operations for the   three   months ended   October 3, 2015   of   $39.7 million  , which included a net charge of   $0.8 million   mainly associated with the change in estimates for prior period tax returns. The Company recognized an income tax provision from continuing operations for the   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015   of   $110.6 million  , which included a net benefit of   $8.4 million   mainly associated with the internal restructuring of foreign entities and the completion of the 2011 and 2012 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits. The effective tax rate from continuing operations, which is calculated as the income tax provision as a percentage of pre-tax income, for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   was   27.8   percent and   29.8   percent, respectively, which includes the benefit from optimizing the Company's international legal entity and cash management structure as well as the permanent extension of the U.S. R D tax credit. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the   three   months and   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015   was   35.5   percent and   31.9   percent, respectively. 
    
  Operating earnings, Net earnings from continuing operations and Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased during the third quarter of 2016 as well as the first nine months of 2016 when compared with the same prior year periods due to the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The increases in Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations also included the impact of common stock repurchases. 
    
  Diluted earnings from continuing operations per common share, as adjusted - defined as Diluted earnings from continuing operations per common share, excluding the earnings per share impact for Restructuring and integration charges and special tax items from continuing operations - increased by $0.14 per share, or 18 percent, to $0.91 per share in the third quarter of 2016 when compared with $0.77 per share for the same period in 2015. The increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, is due to the factors discussed in the preceding paragraphs. In the third quarter of 2016, Restructuring and integration charges from continuing operations were $0.02 per share and special tax items were a net benefit of $0.04 per share.

Marine Engine Segment 
    
  The following table sets forth Marine Engine segment results for the three months and nine months ended: 

__________ 
    
  bpts = basis points 
    
  Net sales for the Marine Engine segment increased in the third quarter of 2016 when compared with the third quarter of 2015. The increase was mainly due to strong growth in the marine service, parts and accessories businesses, which included benefits from favorable market trends, market share gains, the Garelick acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and new product launches. The segment also experienced a solid increase in outboard engine net sales, driven by continued favorable retail demand trends in overall U.S. and European markets and market share gains, reflecting benefits from recently launched new products. Partially offsetting these factors was a decrease in sterndrive engine net sales due to the continuing shift to outboards and unfavorable global retail demand trends.     The acquisition of Garelick accounted for 1 percentage point of the Marine Engine segment's overall revenue growth rate in the third quarter of 2016. International net sales were 31 percent of the segment's net sales in the third quarter of 2016, and increased 1 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales were flat in the third quarter of 2016, which included gains in Canada, Europe and Asia-Pacific, offset by declines in Africa and the Middle East and Latin America. 
    
  Net sales for the Marine Engine segment increased in the first nine months of 2016 when compared with the same prior year period due to the same factors described in the quarterly period above. The acquisitions of BLA and Garelick accounted for 1 percentage point of the Marine Engine segment's overall revenue growth rate in the first nine months of 2016. International net sales were 31 percent of the segment's net sales in the first nine months of 2016, and increased 3 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis.     On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 6 percent in the first nine months of 2016, due to the same factors described in the quarterly period above, except gains in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada were partially offset by Africa and the Middle East and Latin America. 
    
  Marine Engine segment operating earnings increased in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of higher net sales and cost reductions, including benefits from lower commodity costs and sourcing initiatives. Partially offsetting these factors were an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and growth related investments including new product development activities. 
    
  Marine Engine segment operating earnings increased in the first nine months of 2016 due to the same factors described in the quarterly period above.

Boat Segment 
    
  The following table sets forth Boat segment results for the three months and nine months ended: 

__________ 
    
  bpts = basis points 
    
  Boat segment net sales increased in the third quarter of 2016 when compared with the third quarter of 2015 due to strong growth rates across all three primary boat categories, reflecting strong increases in wholesale unit shipments as dealers restocked inventory to more appropriate levels. Additionally, net sales benefited from recently introduced new products and market share gains. The acquisition of Thunder Jet accounted for 1 percentage point of the Boat segment's overall revenue growth rate in the third quarter of 2016. International net sales were 21 percent of the segment's net sales in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 11 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis.     On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 10 percent when compared with the same prior year period mainly due to net sales increases in Canada, Asia-Pacific and Europe, partially offset by declines in Latin America. 
    
  Boat segment net sales increased in the first nine months of 2016 when compared with the same prior year period due to the same factors described in the quarterly period above, except sales of sterndrive and inboard boats and wholesale unit shipments were up slightly and increases in average boat selling prices had a greater impact on sales increases. In addition, wholesale unit growth has lagged retail unit growth through the first nine months of 2016.     Wholesale unit shipments are anticipated to continue to become more balanced with retail unit growth rates in the fourth quarter.     The acquisition of Thunder Jet had a nominal impact on the Boat segment's overall revenue growth rate in the first nine months of 2016. International net sales were 25 percent of the segment's net sales in the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of 4 percent from the prior year on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis, international net sales decreased 3 percent in the first nine months of 2016 due to net sales decreases in Latin America, Canada and Africa and the Middle East, partially offset by increases in Europe and Asia-Pacific. 
    
  Boat segment operating earnings increased in the third quarter of 2016 when compared with the third quarter of 2015 due to higher net sales, which were almost entirely offset by the impact of lower sales volumes of large sterndrive and inboard boats as well as increases in revenue and profit-enhancing investments. 
    
  Boat segment operating earnings increased in the first nine months of 2016 when compared with the same prior year period due to the same factors described in the quarterly period above as well as benefits from lower commodity costs and savings related to sourcing initiatives.

  Fitness segment net sales increased in the third quarter of 2016 when compared with the third quarter of 2015. The acquisitions of Cybex and ICG contributed 17 percentage points to the Fitness segment's overall revenue growth rate in the third quarter of 2016. Net sales also reflected strong overall growth in international markets while revenues in the U.S. were flat, reflecting growth in health clubs and hospitality     which was offset by declines in sales to other channels, including retail and local and federal governments.     International net sales were 48 percent of the segment's net sales in the third quarter of 2016 and increased 23 percent compared with the same prior year period on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions, the segment's international net sales increased 8 percent when compared with the same prior year period due to increases in all international regions except for Latin America. 
    
  Fitness segment net sales increased in the first nine months of 2016 when compared with the same prior year period due to the same factors described in the quarterly period above, except net sales increased in the U.S. The acquisitions of Cybex, ICG and SCIFIT accounted for 18 percentage points of the segment's overall revenue growth rate.     International net sales were 46 percent of the segment's net sales in the first nine months of 2016 and increased 18 percent compared with the same prior year period on a GAAP basis. On a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions, the segment's international net sales increased 7 percent in the first nine months of 2016 as a result of the same factors described in the quarterly period above, except net sales declined in Africa and the Middle East. 
    
  Fitness segment operating earnings increased in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the third quarter of 2015, reflecting higher net sales and modest contributions from Cybex exclusive of restructuring and integration charges, partially offset by restructuring and integration charges, an unfavorable impact of sales mix and increases in growth related investments.

Cash Flow, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The following table sets forth an analysis of free cash flow for the   nine   months ended: 
   
 __________ 
    
  (A) The Company defines  Free cash flow from continuing operations  as cash flow from operating and investing activities of continuing operations (excluding cash provided by or used for acquisitions and investments, transfers to/reductions in restricted cash, purchases or sales/maturities of marketable securities) and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents.  Free cash flow from continuing operations is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. The Company uses this financial measure, both in presenting its results to shareholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses.  Management believes that this financial measure and the information it provides are useful to investors because it permits investors to view Brunswick s performance using the same tool that management uses to gauge progress in achieving its goals.  Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure  Free cash flow from continuing operations  is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund investments in future growth initiatives. 
    
  Brunswick s major sources of funds for investments, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchase programs are cash generated from operating activities, available cash and marketable securities balances and selected borrowings. The Company evaluates potential acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures in the ordinary course of business. 
    
  2016 Cash Flow 
    
  In the first   nine   months of 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled $282.1 million. The primary driver of the cash provided by operating activities was net earnings from continuing operations net of non-cash expense items.     An increase in working capital had a negative effect on net cash provided by operating activities. Working capital is defined as Accounts and notes receivable, Inventories and Prepaid expenses and other, net of Accounts payable and Accrued expenses as presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets excluding the impact of acquisitions and non-cash adjustments.     Net inventories increased by $45.7 million during the first nine months of 2016 due to increases in production to support higher sales volumes. Accrued expenses decreased $26.0 million during the first nine months of 2016, which included the impact of the payments of the prior year's variable compensation and deferred compensation, which had been accrued as of December 31, 2015, as well as the timing of certain accruals. Accounts and notes receivable increased $24.0 million during the first nine months of 2016, due primarily to normal seasonal changes in net sales in the Marine Engine segment and timing of collections. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in Accounts payable of $22.0 million, which was the result of increased domestic production in the Company's Marine Engine segment and timing of payments.  
    
  Net cash used for investing activities of continuing operations during the first nine months of 2016 totaled $377.9 million, which included capital expenditures of $131.9 million.     The Company's capital spending is focused on new product introductions, capacity expansion projects in all segments and other high priority, profit-enhancing projects. Cash paid for the acquisitions of Cybex, Thunder Jet and ICG in the first, second and third quarters of 2016, respectively, net of cash acquired, totaled $269.5 million in the first nine months of 2016. See   Note 4       Acquisitions   in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's acquisitions. Partially offsetting these items were net proceeds from sales or maturities of marketable securities of $10.7 million and $9.8 million from investments. 
    
  Net cash used for financing activities of continuing operations was $126.6 million during the first nine months of 2016. The cash outflow included common stock repurchase activity and cash dividends paid to common shareholders.

2015 Cash Flow 
    
  In the first nine months of 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled $240.7 million. The primary driver of the cash provided by operating activities was net earnings from continuing operations net of non-cash expense items. Increases in net working capital balances had a negative effect on net cash provided by operating activities. Net inventories increased by $45.0 million during the first nine months of 2015 due to increases in production to support higher sales volumes and new product introductions. Accrued expenses decreased $42.1 million during the first nine months of 2015, which was driven primarily by the payment of the prior year's variable compensation, which had been accrued as of December 31, 2014. Accounts and notes receivable increased $10.6 million during the first nine months of 2015, due primarily to normal seasonal changes in net sales in the Marine Engine segment. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in Accounts payable of $15.7 million, which was the result of increased domestic production in the Company's Marine Engine segment.  
    
  Net cash used for investing activities of continuing operations during the first nine months of 2015 totaled $62.1 million, which included capital expenditures of $98.5 million. The Company's capital spending focused on new product introductions, growth initiatives, capacity expansion projects in all segments and other high priority, profit-enhancing projects. Cash paid for the acquisitions of BLA and SCIFIT, net of cash acquired, totaled $18.7 million in the first nine months of 2015. Partially offsetting these items were net proceeds from sales or maturities of marketable securities of $50.7 million that were used to satisfy working capital requirements during the first nine months of 2015. 
    
  Cash flows used for financing activities of continuing operations were $132.5 million during the first nine months of 2015. The cash outflow was primarily the result of common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid to common shareholders. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The Company views its highly liquid assets as of   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , and   October 3, 2015   as: 

The following table sets forth an analysis of total liquidity as of   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015  , and   October 3, 2015  : 

(A) In June 2016, the Company amended and restated its existing credit agreement, dated as of March 2011, as amended and restated as of June 2014. See   Note 15       Debt   in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Company's lending facility. 
    
  (B) The Company defines Total liquidity as Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments in marketable securities as presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, plus amounts available for borrowing under its lending facilities. Total liquidity is not intended as an alternative measure to Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments in marketable securities as determined in accordance with GAAP in the United States. The Company uses this financial measure, both in presenting its results to shareholders and the investment community and in its internal evaluation and management of its businesses. Management believes that this financial measure and the information it provides are useful to investors because it permits investors to view the Company s performance using the same metric that management uses to gauge progress in achieving its goals. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure  Total liquidity  is also useful to investors because it is an indication of the Company s available highly liquid assets and immediate sources of financing. 
    
  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled   $438.0 million   as of   October 1, 2016  , a decrease of $230.8 million from   $668.8 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , and a decrease of $216.4 million from   $654.4 million   as of   October 3, 2015  . Total debt as of   October 1, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   October 3, 2015   was $452.2 million, $448.5 million and $453.1 million, respectively. The Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 24.0 percent as of   October 1, 2016  , down from 25.9 percent as of   December 31, 2015   and from 26.0 percent as of   October 3, 2015  . 
    
  Management believes that the Company has adequate sources of liquidity to meet the Company's short-term and long-term needs. The next significant long-term debt maturity is not until 2021.

On October 22, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $200 million of the Company s outstanding common stock. On February 11, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized $300 million of additional share repurchases. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had repurchased approximately $230 million of common stock under these programs, with approximately $90 million repurchased during the first nine months of 2016. The remaining authorization totals $270 million. Share repurchases will be completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares, and the Company may discontinue purchases at any time that management determines additional purchases are not warranted.  
    
  The Company's plan assumes an increase in net earnings in 2016 when compared with 2015. Net activity in working capital is projected to reflect a usage of cash in 2016 in the range of $40 million to $60 million, including payments under deferred compensation arrangements. These payments mostly occurred in the third quarter and were made in connection with the recent management transitions. Additionally, the Company plans to make cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of approximately $75 million in 2016, most of which have been funded. The Company is planning for capital expenditures of approximately 4 percent to 4.5 percent of 2016 net sales, reflecting substantial new product investments in the outboard engine business and continued capacity investments to support new products and growth. Including these factors, the Company plans to generate free cash flow in 2016 in excess of $215 million.  
    
  The Company contributed   $70.0 million   to its qualified pension plans in the first nine months of both 2016 and 2015 and does not presently expect to make additional contributions to these plans in 2016. The 2016 contributions include an estimated amount which will be used to fund the purchase of group annuity contracts in the fourth quarter of 2016 on behalf of certain plan participants in lieu of future benefit payments. The Company expects to incur an estimated settlement loss of approximately $60 million to $65 million in conjunction with the planned annuity purchases in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, since the final result of the annuity purchases are presently unknown, these amounts are subject to change. The Company also contributed   $2.7 million   to fund benefit payments in its nonqualified pension plan during the first nine months of both 2016 and 2015     and expects to contribute approximately $1 million of additional funding to the plan through the remainder of 2016. Company contributions are subject to change based on market conditions, pension funding regulations and Company discretion. 
    
  Pension Expense 
    
  Pension expense in 2016 is projected to be approximately $15 million, an increase from $11.7 million in 2015. Comparisons between 2016 and 2015 include the impacts of a change in methodology used to calculate the interest cost component of pension expense and a decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets, primarily due to shifts in asset allocation toward fixed income investments. In 2015 and prior years, the Company used a single-weighted average discount rate to calculate pension and postretirement interest costs. Beginning in 2016, the Company is utilizing a "spot rate approach" in the calculation of pension and postretirement interest costs to provide a more accurate measurement of interest costs. The spot rate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension and postretirement interest costs. This calculation change is considered to be a change in accounting estimate and was applied prospectively beginning in 2016.  

Financial Services 
    
  The Company's financial services joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC), is detailed in the 2015 Form 10-K. On March 1, 2016, CDF Ventures, LLC (CDFV), a subsidiary of GE Capital Corporation, completed the sale of its Commercial Distribution Finance business, including CDFV and its interest in the BAC joint venture, to Wells Fargo   Company. The transaction did not have a material effect on BAC. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
    
  The Company s off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations, as of December 31, 2015, are detailed in the 2015 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these arrangements and obligations outside the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2015.

Environmental Regulation 
    
  In its Marine Engine segment, Brunswick continues to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with current and future emissions requirements. The Boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities. The costs associated with these activities may have an adverse effect on segment operating margins and may affect short-term operating results. Environmental regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries may impose higher emissions standards and/or other environmental regulatory requirements than are currently in effect. The Company complies with current regulations and expects to comply fully with any new regulations; compliance will increase the cost of these products for the Company and the industry, but is not expected to have a material adverse effect on Brunswick's competitive position. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  As discussed in the 2015 Form 10-K, the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
    
  There were no material changes in the Company s critical accounting policies since the filing of its 2015 Form 10-K.

    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and we have: 
       
           a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

              b) 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
