1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Organization   

Medifirst
Solutions, Inc. ( MSI  or the  Company ) was incorporated in Nevada in November 2010. The Company has not
generated significant sales to date. The Company intends to have a diverse product line of consumer products. Since inception,
the Company has been engaged in business planning activities, including researching the industry, identifying target markets for
the Company's products, developing the Company's models and financial forecasts, performing due diligence regarding potential
geographic locations most suitable for establishing the Company's offices and identifying future sources of capital. At the present
time, the Company is building products and affiliations in and related to the cosmetic healthcare industry.  

In
July 2016, Medifirst, in response to its Premarket Notification 510(k) submission for  The Time Machine  Series Laser,
received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to market its infrared Time Machine TTML-8102000
Laser Thermal Therapeutic Device.The Company is actively putting together a sales and distribution team to offer our lasers in
the US market.  

Pursuant
to a sale and purchase agreement dated August 19, 2015 between the Company and the Company's president, the Company acquired 100%
of the equity interests in Medical Lasers Manufacturer, Inc. ( MLM ) with the total purchase price of 20,000 shares
of the Company's common stock at $0.001 per share (or $20). The fair value of the acquired entity was $20.  

The
transaction was considered as a business acquisition and accordingly the acquisition method of accounting has been applied. MLM
had no assets at the date of the business combination.  

The
Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MSI and its only wholly owned subsidiary, MLM. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

The
Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding
to operationalize the Company s current technology.

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
for interim financial information. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such principles
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for Form 10-Q. All adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
have been made which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of interim periods. The
results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year
because of, among other things, seasonality factors in the retail business. The unaudited financial statements contained herein
should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  

Some
items in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Reclassifications had no
effect on prior year net income or shareholders  equity.  

Revenue
Recognition   

In
general, the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product
delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The
following policies reflect specific criteria for the various revenues streams of the Company:  

Revenue
is recognized at the time the product is delivered or services are performed. Provision for sales returns are estimated based
on the Company's historical return experience. Revenue is presented net of returns.  

Accounts
Receivable   

The
Company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers,
maintaining an allowance for potential credit losses. Accounts receivable is reported net of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
The allowance is based on management's estimate of the amount of receivables that will actually be collected. The Company has
not recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  

Inventory   

Inventory
consists of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market value.  

Equipment   

Equipment,
consisting of computer equipment, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, of five years.

Long-Lived
Assets   

The
Company reviews long-lived assets, such as equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying
amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of
an asset exceeds the estimated future cash flows, an impairment loss will be recorded by the amount the carrying value exceeds
the fair value of the asset.  

In
August 2015, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary MLM, acquired a trademark for $20,000. Due to the uncertainty of future cash
flows from the trademark, management has deemed it to be impaired and recorded an impairment expense of $20,000 in the quarter
ended September 2015.  

Intangible
Asset- Licensing Agreement   

On
March 8th 2016, the company, through it's sole wholly-owned subsidiary ( Licensee ), entered into a Product and Know-How
License Agreement ( Agreement ) with a Florida Corporation ( Licensor ). The license provides with respect
to the Technology, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee an irrevocable, nontransferable, royalty-bearing license, with a right of
sublicense (the  License ), throughout the Territory in the Field of Use, whether or not under the Licensed Patent,
to:  

-
use or submit or deliver the Technology and/or any Product to any regulatory body throughout the Territory for purposes of
obtaining approval to make, Sell, offer for Sale, import, export and distribute the Technology or Products; and  

-
use or copy the Technology and/or any Product; and  

-
market, make, have made, Sell, offer for Sale, import and distribute Products; and  

-
sublicense the Technology; and  

-
prepare, or have prepared on its behalf, modifications, enhancements and/or derivative works of the Technology.  

In
connection with the license granted, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a license to the Licensed Patents, whether now existing
or hereafter acquired.  

The
consideration for the licensing agreement consisted of the issuance of 25,000 Series B Preferred stock shares to the Licensor
(at par) plus a $150,000 promissory note issued by the Company to the licensor. The last part of the consideration in this license
agreement is the royalty payments which have not taken effect yet as they are based on sales for which the company has none.

  (Unaudited)  

The
licensing agreement is for a ten year period effective from March 8th 2016. The cost of the licensing agreement is being amortized
over it's ten-year period and charged to income on a straight-line basis.  

Debt
Issues Costs and Debt Discount   

The
Company may pay debt issue costs, and record debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of convertible
debt. These costs are amortized over the life of the debt to interest expense. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs,
a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts are immediately expensed. Beginning in 2015, the Company early-adopted ASU 2015-03:
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs and has reflected the deferred financing costs as a direct reduction of the
related debt (See table included in Note 5 to Consolidated Financial Statements).  

Original
Issue Discount   

For
certain convertible debt issued, the Company provides the debt holder with an original issue discount. The original issue discount
is recorded to debt discount, reducing the face amount of the note and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt.  

Derivative
Liabilities   

Fair
value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity
instruments, and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. The Company assessed its securities for purposes of
determining the proper accounting treatment and valuation as set forth in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ASC 820 10 35 37
 Fair Value in Financial Instruments ; Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ASC 815  Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities ; and Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) Issue No. 00 19 and EITF 07 05.  

In
assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible
debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional
convertible debt, the Company will continue its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments.  

Once
the derivative liabilities are determined, they are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase
or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Financial
Instruments   

The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities
approximate their fair values.  

Segment
Information   

The
Company follows Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 280,  Segment Reporting . The Company currently
operates in a single segment and will evaluate additional segment disclosure requirements as it expands its operations.  

Net
Income (Loss) Per Common Share   

The
Company calculates net income (loss) per share based on the authoritative guidance. Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated
by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss)
per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock
equivalents outstanding. During periods in which the Company incurs losses, common stock equivalents, if any, are not considered,
as their effect would be anti-dilutive.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company utilizes the accrual method of accounting for income taxes. Under the accrual method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities,
and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance
against deferred tax assets is recognized, when it is more likely than not, that such tax benefits will not be realized.  

The
Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a
tax authority would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a  more-likely-than-not  threshold,
the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority.
For tax positions not meeting the threshold, no financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognizes interest and
penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits
as of September 30, 2016, and does not expect this to change significantly over the next 12 months.

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC
718 requires all share-based compensation payments to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value on the
issuance date.  

Equity
instruments granted to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 505, Equity. The final measurement date for the
fair value of equity instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument
is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for non-performance.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At September
30, 2016, the Company had $134,079 in cash equivalents and $156,958 in cash equivalents a December 31, 2015.  

Recent
Pronouncements   

In
May 2014, FASB and IASB issued a new joint revenue recognition standard that supersedes nearly all GAAP guidance on revenue recognition.
The core principle of the standard is that revenue recognition should depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
The new standard is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.   

On
January 05, 2016, the FASB completed its Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments project by issuing ASU No. 2016-01, Financial
Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The new
guidance improves certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. For
public business entities, the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe the impact of its pending adoption of this ASU on the Company s
consolidated financial statements will be material.  

In
November 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17 - Income Taxes (Topic 740) Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes which simplifies
the presentation of deferred income taxes. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial
statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company
does not believe the impact of its pending adoption of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements will
be material.

In
February 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-02 Consolidation (Topic 810) Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The amendments in this
Update affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal
entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. The amendments in this Update are effective for public
business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The
Company does not believe the impact of its pending adoption of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements
will be material.

In
December 2012, the Company issued a promissory note to a stockholder in the amount of $5,000 with interest at 10% per annum. Principal
and interest were due and payable on June 2, 2013. In April 2014, the note was amended to provide the note holder with the option
to convert the note to the Company's common stock at $0.0001 per share. Subsequently, in 2014, in a private transactions, the
note holder transferred $2,500 of note principal to third parties and the new holders converted their holdings into 2,500,000
shares of the Company's common stock. During 2015, the original note holder transferred an additional $2,400 of note principal
to third parties who converted their holdings into 2,400,000 shares of the Company's common stock. At September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the loan had balance was $100 and $100, respectively.  

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was indebted to a stockholder in the amount of $1,500 and $1,500, respectively.
The loan has an interest rate of 26.7%. Principal and accrued interest were due and payable on January 1, 2014.  

In
February 2016, the Company issued a promissory note to a stockholder in the amount of $7,000 with interest at the rate of 6% per
annum. On September 6, 2016 the note holder converted the entire principal balance and accrued interest into common stock and
therefore at September 30, 2016 there is no principal balance remaining on the note.  

Note
5. CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  

Note
Payable-BS    

In
March 2011, the Company issued $800 aggregate principal amount of 6% convertible notes due in January 2012. Interest on the notes
accrue at the rate of 6% per annum and are payable when the notes mature. The notes matured prior to conversion but have not been
repaid. Interest continues to accrue at the rate of 6% per annum.  

The
holder of one of the notes converted $110 of note principal into 1,100,000 shares of common stock as follows:  

In
August 2013, in a private transaction, the same note holder transferred $330 of the remaining note principal plus $55 in accrued

6. DERIVATIVES AND FAIR VALUE INSTRUMENTS  

The
Company applied paragraph 815-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to the 5% Convertible Notes Payable issued
June 12th 2015 and the 8% Convertible Note payable issued June 25th 2015 and for the 8% Convertible Notes Payable issued January
7, 2016 and March 7, 2016. Based on the guidance in paragraph 815-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the Company
concluded these instruments were required to be accounted for as derivatives on issuance date. The Company records the fair value
of the Convertible Notes Payable and certain warrants that are classified as derivatives on issuance date and the fair value changes
on each reporting date reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as  Gain (loss) on derivative liabilities. 
These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments under paragraph 815-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification and are disclosed on the balance sheet under Derivative Liabilities.  

The
Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for
disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
(3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:  

Level
1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.  

Level
2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
as of the reporting date.  

Level
3 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.  

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  

Medifirst
Solutions, Inc.  

  Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  

  September

  (Unaudited)  

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.  

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepayments and other current assets,
accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.  

The
Company s Level 3 financial liabilities consist of the 5% Convertible Notes Payable issued June 12th 2015 and the 8% Convertible
Note payable issued June 25th 2015 and for the 8% Convertible Notes Payable issued January 7, 2016 and March 7, 2016, for which
there is no current market for these securities such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.
We have valued the automatic conditional conversion, re-pricing/down-round, change of control; default and follow-on offering
provisions using a lattice model, with the assistance of a valuation consultant, for which management understands the methodologies.
These models incorporate transaction details such as Company stock price, contractual terms, maturity, risk free rates, as well
as assumptions about future financings, volatility, and holder behavior as of issuance and September 30, 2016. The primary assumptions
include: projected annual volatility of 98%-220%; the follow-on securities purchase option; the conversion feature as a percentage
of Market; automatic/conditional conversions; market price trigger events.  

As
of September 30, 2016 the Company s derivative financial instruments included:  

1)
Embedded derivatives associated with certain of the Company s unsecured convertible notes payable. The Company s 5
% convertible notes payable and 8% convertible notes payable issued to four unrelated investors is a hybrid instrument, which
warrants separate accounting as a derivative instrument. The embedded derivative feature has been bifurcated from the debt host
contract, referred to as the Derivative Liability, which resulted in a reduction of the initial carrying amount (as unamortized
discount) of the Convertible Notes Payable. The unamortized discount is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest
method over the life of the Notes. The embedded derivative feature includes the conversion feature within the notes and an early
redemption option. The compound embedded derivatives within the convertible notes have been recorded at fair value at the date
of issuance; and are marked-to-market each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded to the Company s statement
of operations as Change in fair value of derivative liabilities.

The
5% Convertible Note Payable and the 8% Convertible Notes Payable are valued at September 30, 2016. The following assumptions were
used for the valuation of the embedded derivative:  

-
The stock price of $0.0071 up to $0.0152 and back down to $.0073 in this period (variable conversion price) would fluctuate with
the Company projected volatility;  

-
An event of default for the Convertible Note would occur 0% of the time, increasing 1.00% per month to a maximum of 5.0%;  

-
Alternative financing for the Convertible Note would be initially available to redeem the note 0% of the time and increase monthly
by 1% to a maximum of 10%;  

-
Capital raising events (a single financing at 1 month from the valuation date) are a factor for the VV to LG Convertible Note.
The full reset events projected to occur based on future stock issuance (single event) resulting in a reset exercise price.  

-
The monthly trading volume would average $126,178 and would increase at 5% per month;ownership limits conversion across LG s
6 notes based on 4.99% with shares outstanding increasing monthly by 1%.  

-
The variable conversion price of 50% to 58% over 3 to 20 trading days would have effective rates of 43.09% to 51.81%;  

-
The Note Holders would automatically convert the notes early (and not hold to maturity) with variable conversion prices and full
ratchet resets if the registration was effective and not in default;  

-
The projected annual volatility for each valuation period was based on the historical volatility of the company:

Note
9. INCOME TAXES  

The
Company's deferred tax asset consists primarily of carryforward net operating losses (NOLs). The Company believes that, at this
time, it is more likely than not that the benefit of the NOLs will not be realized and has therefore recorded a full valuation
allowance.  

The
income tax benefit differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal and state income tax rates to the loss before
income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the differences are as follows:  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $1,553,512 to reduce future federal
taxable income which begins to expire in the year 2030. The Company is also subject to corporate taxes in the State of New Jersey
which has similiar net operating loss carryover provisions which start to expire in the year 2030.  

The
Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations in progress, nor has it had any federal or state examinations since
its inception. All of the Company's open tax years beginning in tax year 2013 are subject to federal and state tax examinations.  

Note
10. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

In
August 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Medical Lasers Manufacturer, Inc. ( MLM )
from a stockholder and officer of the Company for 20,000 common shares which were valued at $0.015 per share. All intercompany
transactions were eliminated during consolidation.  

As
more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company owed the following amounts to related parties

manner. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016 the CEO was paid $15,000 via payroll and $10,000 was accrued. For the nine months

to shares of common stock during 2015.  

In
August 2015, MLM acquired a trademark from the son of the Company s President for $20,000 due 90 days from the date of acquisition.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued 3,400 shares of Preferred Series B stock as settlement on this liability.
Due to the uncertainty of future cash flows from the trademark management has deemed it to be impaired and recorded an impairment
expense of $20,000 at September 30, 2015.  

In
August 2015, subsequent to the date the Company acquired MLM, MLM purchased $50,000 in inventory from the son of the Company's
President. The inventory consisted of 20 hand-held laser devices. During the quarter-ended March 31, 2016, 10,000 shares of Series
B Preferred stock were issued in settlement of this liability.  

As
more fully described in Note 1-Intangible Asset-Licensing Agreement, on March 8th 2016 the Company entered into a Licensing Agreement
with a Florida Corporation (Licensor) that is owned by a related party. The Company issued 25,000 shares of Series B Preferred
stock to the Licensor as partial consideration for the Licensing agreement plus a $150,000 promissory note to the Licensor for
the balance of the consideration. During the quarter-ended March 31, 2016, 3,400 shares of Series B Preferred stock were converted
into 1,700,000 shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the Series B Preferred stock.  

Note
11. BASIS OF REPORTING - GOING CONCERN  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  

Medifirst

  September

  (Unaudited)  

The
Company has incurred losses from inception of approximately $1,779,549, which, among other factors, raises substantial doubt about
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
management's plans to raise additional capital from the sale of stock and receive additional loans from related parties. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.  

Note
12. STOCK COMPENSATION - EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN  

In
July 2016, the Company adopted the Medifirst Solutions, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) pursuant to which
the Company may grant stock options, restricted stock purchase offers and other equity-based awards up to an aggregate of 20,000,000
shares of common stock. The Plan is designed to retain directors, executives and selected employees and consultants and reward
them for making contributions to the success of the Company. These objectives are accomplished by making long-term incentive awards
under the Plan thereby providing Participants with a proprietary interest in the growth and performance of the Company.  

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued from the Plan a total of 8,000,000 shares of common stock to non-employees
for services rendered. As of September 30, 2016 there is a balance of 12,000,000 shares available for future issuance under the
Medifirst Solutions, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan.

Plan
of Operation   

Medifirst
Solutions, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada in November 2010. The Company began as a development stage company focused on developing
products within the healthcare market for both consumer and professional applications. In 2013, Medifirst began to developing
its own line of disposable electronic cigarettes ( e-cigs ) but the e-cig industry subsequently encountered significant
government push-back to try to heavily regulate their use and production, including a ban on e-cigs. In order to avoid the uncertainties
and costs of the regulated e-cig industry, Medifirst entered into an agreement with Panacea Photonics Corporation that allowed
Medifirst to exclusively market and distribute a series of Botanical LED Light Therapy Systems, including skin care and pain relief
products. Under the terms of the marketing and distribution agreement, Medifirst became the exclusive distributor of the light
therapy products in both New York and New Jersey. In 2014, in addition to the LED light therapy division, the Company became a
dealer for Atmospheric Water Solutions, a Florida based company that sells water generators that makes drinking water from air.
In 2015, the Company made a strategic decision to add laser technology to its health and wellness division and discontinue its
efforts with its light therapy and water generator products. The Company entered into an exclusive manufacturing agreement to
produce what is now its hand-held mobile laser system known as  The Time Machine Program  for which the Company purchased
the registered trademark. Furthermore, the Company made an initial purchase of 20 TTM Series laser units from the developer of
the lasers.  

Medifirst,
through its wholly-owned subsidiary Medical Laser Manufacturer, Inc., entered into a Product and Know-How License Agreement with
Laser Lab Corp to license the use of various intellectual property in connection with seeking regulatory approval for and marketing,
distributing and selling The Time Machine Series Lasers ( TTM Series ). The License Agreement grants a license to
the Company to use various intellectual property for the development, manufacture and sale of lasers in the TTM Series for which
the Company previously filed a Premarket Notification 510(k) submission with the FDA. In addition to the license granted to the
Company, the License Agreement provides for an option to license other fields of use of the infrared laser in the TTM Series,
as well as other wavelengths and colors, allowing the Company to develop a broader range of product offerings in the future.  

FDA
510(k) Clearance   

On
July 8, 2016, Medifirst, in response to its Premarket Notification 510(k) submission for  The Time Machine  Series
Laser, received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to market its infrared Time Machine TTML-8102000
Laser Thermal Therapeutic Device.  

Market
Rollout Strategy   

As
part of the pre-sales and marketing rollout of the TTM Series, Medifirst has implemented internal controls and procedures as mandated
by the FDA. These controls and procedures include checks and balances to be implemented prior to sale in the Company s office,
which procedures will also be put in place at the Company s manufacturer.  

The
Company has contracted a Sales Director for international sales and has started its sales initiatives from its new office space
for FDA controls and procedures and for training. The Company continues to actively engage additional sales and distribution affiliates
to offer our lasers in the US market. Furthermore, we expect to engage various product marketing teams to introduce our brand
and products to direct and indirect customers of the TTM Series. We expect our team to be made up of seasoned professionals with
experience in the sales and marketing of medical devices to target and analyze the specific markets and sectors in which the Company
will focus its revenue generating efforts. Additionally, as part of a plan to enhance corporate governance, the Company will continue
to appoint and utilize members on its Advisory Board with the goal to establish a Board of Directors with well-established credentials
in the medical device industry, as well as established and renowned industry professionals from the business and financial community.  

Additionally,
we are actively interviewing sales and marketing professionals to introduce the Time Machine technology to international markets.
As part of our sales strategy, we will highlight to the medical community our belief that the Time Machine hand-held mobile laser
unit offers a very unique, effective and affordable alternative to the extremely costly and bulky laser machines current being
offered in the marketplace.  

Financial
Reporting    

Our
auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue
as an on-going business for the next twelve (12) months. Our auditors  opinion is based on the uncertainty of our ability
to establish profitable operations. The opinion results from the fact that we have not generated significant revenues.  Accordingly,
we must raise cash from operations or from investments by others in the Company to continue our operations.  

Our
sole officer and director is responsible for our managerial and organizational structure, which will include preparation of disclosure
and accounting controls under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. When these controls are implemented, he will be responsible for
the administration of the controls. Should he not have sufficient experience, he may be incapable of creating and implementing
the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the SEC which could materially and adversely affect our
business.

OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Revenues   

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $-0- and $-0-, respectively. The company is still in developmental stage and does

Expenses   

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, expenses were $192,123 and $103,967, respectively. The reason for the increase in expenses was primarily
due to substantial increases in: advertising and promotions costs, consulting fees, professional fees, and subscriptions. These
increases are in-line with the Company s mission as they start to plan to enter the market with product. 

Legal, Accounting, Consulting and Other Professional Fees   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 professional fees were $139,153 and $51,389, respectively. The substantial increases
were due to additional    accounting, consulting
and professional fees incurred in the connection with accounting for derivatives, SEC compliance, legal services for an increased
number of conversions and contracts, and general bookkeeping and financial statement preparation.  

Other Income/(Expense)   

For the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, other expenses were ($251,385) and ($4,196), respectively. These changes were all due to the changes in fair
value of derivatives for the quarter and interest expense on debt, amortization of original issue discount, amortization of deferred
financing costs, loss on the extinguishment of debt and derivative discount amortization. Such derivatives and convertible debt
were non-existent the prior year comparative quarter. 

Net Income/(Loss)   

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 the company had a net loss of ($443,508) and ($108,163). 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS
ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

Revenues   

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated $-0- and $1,858, respectively. The company is still in developmental stage and

Expenses   

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, expenses were $426,986 and $186,849, respectively. Expenses increased significantly during the nine months due primarily
to substantial spending on advertising and promotions costs, consulting fees, professional fees, lab testing and dues and subscriptions.
These increases are part of the Company s plan as they procced to enter the marketplace with product. 

Legal, Accounting, Consulting and Other Professional Fees   

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 professional fees were $234,891 and $61,659, respectively. As noted above during the quarter ended September 30,
2016, the were substantial increases in accounting, consulting and professional fees incurred in the connection with accounting
for derivatives, SEC compliance, legal services for an increased number of conversions and contracts, and general bookkeeping and
financial statement preparation

For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, other income was $33,779 and $-0- respectively, and other expenses were ($416,734) and ($5,018), respectively.
These changes were due to the changes in fair value of derivatives for the nine months and interest expense on debt, amortization
of original issue discount, amortization of deferred financing costs, loss on the extinguishment of debt, and derivative discount.
Such derivatives and convertible debt were non-existent and substantially less in the prior year comparative nine months.  

Net Income/(Loss)   

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 the company had a net loss of ($809,941) and ($195,159). 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Since incorporation, we
have financed our operations through the private placement of our common stock to selected investors and periodic borrowings from
our stockholders. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our principal sources of liquidity included cash of $134,079 and
$156,958, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016,
we did not have any significant commitments for capital expenditures. 

If we do not generate
sufficient cash flow to support our operations over the next twelve (12) months, in order to continue as a going concern we may
need to raise additional capital by issuing capital stock in exchange for cash. There are no formal or informal agreements to attain
such financing. The Company s ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties,
including: investors  perception of, and demand for, securities of companies in our industry; conditions of the U.S. and
other capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds; future results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Therefore,
the Company s management cannot assure that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company,
or if at all. Any failure by the Company s management to raise additional funds on terms favorable to the Company could have
a material adverse effect on the Company s liquidity and financial condition. 

Critical
Accounting Policies    

Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements. While all these significant
accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies
determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management
to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that
given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would
cause an effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements    

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial
officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, our principal
executive and financial officers concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, due to the inadequate recordation
of certain transactions and communication of those transactions to those integral to our disclosure procedures, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is
(1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
