NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)              Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation         Bergio International, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 24, 2007 under the name Alba Mineral Exploration, Inc.  On October 21, 2009, as a result of a Share Exchange Agreement, the corporate name was changed to Bergio International, Inc. Effective July 15, 2013, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to increase the Company s authorized capital from 1,500,000,000 common shares to 3,000,000,000 common shares of stock. On April 3, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to reduce the par value of all shares of common stock and preferred stock from $0.001 to $0.00001 per share.  On February 26, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock of the Company to 6,000,000,000 shares. Effective on October 14, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate a 1-for-1,000 reverse stock split of the Company s common stock. All share and per share data has been adjusted to reflect such stock splits and change in par value. The Company is engaged in the product design, manufacturing, distribution of fine jewelry primarily in the United States and is headquartered in Fairfield, New Jersey. The Company experiences significant seasonal volatility. The first two quarters of the year typically represent 15% - 35% of annual sales, and the remaining two quarters represent the remaining portion of annual sales.        Crown Luxe, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 5, 2014, to operate the Company s first retail store which was opened in Bergen County, New Jersey in the fourth quarter of 2014. It is our intent to provide another area for growth by establishing a retail outlet for the Company s products.        On June 1, 2015, the Company acquired a 51% interest in R.S. Fisher, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( R.S. Fisher ), in exchange for funding the company s operations.  The minority shareholder contributed jewelry molds and inventory valued at $349,292.       In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  These results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and consequently do not include disclosures normally made in an Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The December 31, 2015 balance sheet included herein was derived from the audited financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of that date.  Accordingly, the financial statements included herein should be reviewed in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 30, 2016 (the  Annual Report ).         Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies          Principles of Consolidation        The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.       During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there have been no other material changes in the Company s significant accounting policies to those previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report.                    7          BERGIO INTERNATIONAL, INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)              Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)           Non-controlling Interest         Non-controlling interest represents third party ownership in the net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries. For financial reporting purposes, the assets and liabilities of our majority owned subsidiaries are consolidated with those of our own, with any third party investor s interest shown as non-controlling interest.       On June 1, 2015, the Company acquired a 51% interest in R.S. Fisher, in exchange for funding the company s operations.  The minority holder contributed jewelry molds and inventory valued at $349,292.         Note 3 - Income (Loss) per Share         Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Dilutive earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could occur through the effect of common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, warrants and convertible securities.  Basic net loss per share equaled the diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, since the effect of shares potentially issuable upon the exercise or conversion was anti-dilutive. Equity instruments that may dilute earnings per share in the future are listed in Note 6 below. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 common shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible debt were not included in the computation of diluted net loss because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive       The following table sets forth the computation of earnings per share:               4 - New Authoritative Accounting Guidance         In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new standard requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020, with early application permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.            8          BERGIO INTERNATIONAL, INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)              4 - New Authoritative Accounting Guidance (continued)         In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 ("Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting") which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.       In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 ("Leases"), which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.       In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 (ASC Subtopic 825-10), Financial Instruments- Overall Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this ASU require entities to measure all investments in equity securities at fair value with changes recognized through net income. This requirement does not apply to investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting, to those that result in consolidation of the investee, or for which the entity meets a practicability exception to fair value measurement. Additionally, the amendments eliminate certain disclosure requirements related to financial instruments measured at amortized cost and add disclosures related to the measurement categories of financial assets and financial liabilities. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for only certain portions of the ASU. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.       In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 (ASC Topic 740), Income Taxes Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted by all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.       In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 (ASC Topic 805), Business Combinations Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize measurement period adjustments in the period in which the adjustments are determined. The income effects of such measurement period adjustments are to be recorded in the same period s financial statements but calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date. The impact of measurement period adjustments to earnings that relate to prior period financial statements are to be presented separately on the income statement or disclosed by line item. The amendments in this update are for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.       In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (ASU 2015-15). The previous guidance in ASU 2015-03, as defined below, did not address the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-15 is effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted and entities shall apply the guidance retrospectively to all prior year periods presented. The Company is in the process of assessing the effects of the application of the new guidance.        9          BERGIO INTERNATIONAL, INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)          4 - New Authoritative Accounting Guidance (continued)         In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ). To simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted and entities shall apply the guidance retrospectively to all prior year periods presented. The Company is in the process of assessing the effects of the application of the new guidance.       In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 that introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact, if any, it will have on its consolidated financial statements.       In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern , which requires management to evaluate whether conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and, if so, to provide related footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for annual or interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated Financial Statements.       In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . This ASU applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost. Under the updated guidance, an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predicable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory that is measured using last-in, last-out ( LILO ). This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim and annual reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2015-11 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       No other recently issued accounting pronouncements had or are expected to have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.         Note 5 - Bank Lines of Credit         A summary of the Company s credit facilities is as follows:             The Company s CEO also serves as a guarantor of the Company s debt.        10          BERGIO INTERNATIONAL, INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)              Note 6 - Convertible Debt          Fife, Typenex and Iliad        In December 2012, the Company entered into a $325,000 convertible note with Fife consisting of three tranches to be drawn down with the first tranche totaling $125,000, including $25,000 in loan costs and an additional two tranches totaling $200,000. The note bears a 5% annual interest rate and matures eighteen months from the date of issuance. The note is convertible into common shares of the Company based on 70% of the average of the three lowest closing prices of the common stock for the proceeding 15 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the conversion. During 2013, the conversion price was fixed at $0.005 per share. As of December 31, 2012, the Company only drew down the first tranche totaling $125,000. On February 11, 2013, April 5, 2013, April 23, 2013, and July 1, 2013, the Company drew down an additional $250,000.         On June 5, 2014, the Company, Fife, Typenex and Iliad Research and Trading, LLP ( Iliad ) entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement and Note Purchase Agreement (the  Note Purchase Agreement ) whereby Iliad acquired all of Fife s and Typenex s right, title, obligations and interest in, to and arising under the Company Notes (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) and the Note Purchase Documents (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement).        On October 17, 2014, the Company entered into a financing arrangement with Iliad to provide additional financing in the amount of up to $450,000 through the issuance of a Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the  Note ). The Company agreed to cover Iliad s legal, accounting and other related fees in the amount of $5,000, which is included in the principal balance of the Note. The Note will accrue interest at the rate of 8% per annum until the Note is paid in full. Monies are to be drawn in eight tranches with the initial tranche in the amount of $105,000, and the remaining balance of $350,000 in 7 tranches of $50,000 each. The Company drew down the initial tranche on October 17, 2014. The Note has a maturity date of July 17, 2016. The Company is currently negotiating with the lender (see below).       Beginning six months after October 17, 2014 and on the same day each month thereafter, the Company shall make an installment payment, based upon the unpaid balance. At the option of the Company, payments may be made in cash or by converting the installment amount into shares of the Company s common stock. The conversion price is equal to the lesser of (i) $0.0005 per share and (ii) 67.5% of the average of the three lowest closing bid prices in the 15 trading days immediately preceding the conversion. The Company has the right to prepay the Note at 135% of the outstanding balance at the time of prepayment. There were no conversions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The outstanding balance at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $100,000, respectively, with accrued interest of $14,436 and $10,630 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.       During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company drew down an additional $314,703. There were no conversions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The outstanding balances at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $328,470 and $328,470, respectively, with accrued interest of $23,478 and $11,005 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.       During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made a retail sale to a customer in the amount of $497,600. This customer holds convertible debt which the Company is obligated to pay them in the amount of approximately $428,000. The Company is currently negotiating an agreement with this customer to offset the convertible debt against the accounts receivable.                     11          BERGIO INTERNATIONAL, INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)              Note 6 - Convertible Debt (continued)          Third Party Note        In November 2014, the Company converted a portion of its outstanding accounts payable for legal services to a third party into two convertible promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $63,275. These are demand notes and accrue interest at the rate of 10% on the outstanding balance. The notes are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock based on 65% of the average ten trading days closing bid price during the preceding ten consecutive trading days immediately prior to the conversion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, principal of $16,843 was converted into 244,880,876 shares of common stock.

Note 7 - Derivative Liability         The Company accounts for the fair value of the conversion features of its convertible debt in accordance with ASC Topic No. 815-15  Derivatives and Hedging; Embedded Derivatives  ( Topic No. 815-15 ). Topic No. 815-15 requires the Company to bifurcate and separately account for the conversion features as an embedded derivative contained in the Company s convertible debt. The Company is required to carry the embedded derivative on its balance sheet at fair value and account for any unrealized change in fair value as a component of results of operations. The Company values the embedded derivatives using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Amortization of debt discount amounted to $1,965 and $9,489 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $68,958 and $109,496 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

Variable Conversion Prices   - The conversion price was based on: (i) 50% of the average closing bid price during the preceding ten consecutive trading days immediately prior to the conversion at September 30, 2016 for Carebourn Capital; (ii) 60% of the lowest trading prices during the 20 days prior to the date of conversion at September 30,2016 for LG Capital; (iii)  the lower of $0.018 per share or 60% of the lowest trading price during the 25 days prior to the date of conversion at September 30, 2016 for JMJ Financial.                13          BERGIO INTERNATIONAL, INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)              Note 7 - Derivative Liability (continued)           Time to Maturity   - The time to maturity was determined based on the length of time between the valuation date and the maturity of the debt. Time to maturity ranged from 92 to 197 days at September 30, 2016.         Risk Free Rate   - The risk free rate was based on the Treasury Note rate as of the valuation dates with a term commensurate with the remaining term of the debt. The risk free rate at September 30, 2016 ranged from 0.29% to 0.59%, based on the term of the note.         Volatility   - The volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company. The average volatility was 480.04% at September 30, 2016.         Note 8 - Related Party Transactions         The Company receives periodic advances from its principal executive officer based upon the Company s cash flow needs. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $255,125 and $253,073, respectively, was due to the principal executive officer, including accrued interest.  Interest expense is accrued at an average annual market rate of interest which was 3.50% at September 30, 2016 and 3.15% at December 31, 2015.  Interest expense associated with this loan was $4,367 and $12,473 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $4,455 and $7,493 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. No terms for repayment have been established. As a result, the amount is classified as a Current Liability.       Effective September 1, 2011, the Company and CEO entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the  Amended Agreement ) which primarily retains the term and compensation of the original agreement. The Amended Agreement, however, removes the section which previously provided for the issuance of Company common stock to the CEO, from time to time, when the Company is unable to pay the CEO the full amount of his Base Salary (as defined in the Amended Agreement) which would allow the CEO to maintain a fifty-one percent (51%) share of the Company s outstanding common stock.  However, the CEO does have the right to request all or a portion of his unpaid Base Salary be paid with the Company s restricted common stock. In addition, the Amended Agreement provides for the issuance of 51 shares of newly authorized Series A Preferred Stock to be issued to the CEO. As defined in the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of the Series A Preferred Stock, each share of Series A Preferred Stock has voting rights such that the holder of 51 shares of Series A Preferred Stock will effectively maintain majority voting control of the Company. Effective November 3, 2011, the CEO notified the Company that for the one year period, retroactive from April 1, 2011, through December 31, 2012, he would reduce his Base Salary to $100,000. The reduction in base compensation was subsequently extended to December 31, 2013. The CEO is currently deferring a portion of his salary to conserve cash. Deferred wages due to the CEO amounted to $409,599 and $280,659 for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.       The Company is in process of extending this agreement.         Note 9 - Litigation         We are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect.         Note 10 - Subsequent Events         The Company evaluated subsequent events, which are events or transactions that occurred after September 30, 2016 through the issuance of the accompanying financial statements, and determined that there were no reportable events.        14                Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations         Forward Looking Statements        This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other reports (collectively, the  Filings ) filed by Bergio International, Inc. ( Bergio  or the  Company ) from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company s management.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof.  When used in the Filings, the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   future,   intend,   plan,  or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company s management identify forward-looking statements.  Such statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including the risks contained in the  Risk Factors  section of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016, relating to the Company s industry, the Company s operations and results of operations, and any businesses that the Company may acquire.  Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.       Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.  Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.       Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).  These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions.  We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made.  These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.  Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results.  In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its application.  There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.        Plan of Operation        We concentrate our business on boutique, upscale jewelry stores. We currently sell our jewelry to approximately 50 independent jewelry retailers across the United States. We have spent over $3 million in branding the Bergio name through tradeshows, trade advertising, national advertising and billboard advertising since launching the line in 1995. As of October 1, 2014, the Company ceased operations in Russia due to the economic, currency and political condition in Russia. The Company intends to concentrate on its domestic operations. Our products consist of a wide range of unique styles and designs made from precious metals such as, gold, platinum, and Karat gold, as well as diamonds and other precious stones. We currently design and produce approximately 100 to 150 product styles. Current retail prices for our products range from $400 to $200,000. We have manufacturing control over our line as a result of having a manufacturing facility in New Jersey as well as subcontracts with facilities located in Italy.       It is our intention to establish Bergio as a holding company for the purpose of acquiring established jewelry design and manufacturing firms who possess branded product lines. Branded product lines are products and/or collections whereby the jewelry manufacturers have established their products within the industry through advertising in consumer and trade magazines as well as possibly obtaining federally registered trademarks of their products and collections. This is in line with our strategy and belief that a brand name can create an association with innovation, design and quality which helps add value to the individual products as well as facilitate the introduction of new products.            15         We intend to acquire design and manufacturing firms throughout the United States and Europe. We intend to locate potential candidates through our relationships in the industry.  However, as of the date of this report, we do not have any binding agreements with any potential acquisition candidates.       Crown Luxe, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 5, 2014 in order to operate the Company s first retail store located in Bergen County, New Jersey, which opened in the fourth quarter of 2014. We intend to provide another area for growth by establishing a retail outlet for the Company s products.       On June 1, 2015, the Company acquired a 51% interest in R.S. Fisher, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( R.S. Fisher ), in exchange for funding the company s operations. The minority shareholder contributed jewelry molds and inventory valued at $349,292.       Our future operations are contingent upon increasing revenues and raising capital for on-going operations and expansion of our product lines. Because we have a limited operating history, you may have difficulty evaluating our business and future prospects.        Results of Operations               Sales        Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $42,894 (32.5%) to $88,986, as compared to $131,880 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease is attributed to a decline in wholesale and retail sales. The Company intends to concentrate on its domestic operations and explore additional opportunities to expand its business. However, there has been a general slowdown in the market for the Company s products.       Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $142,803 (19.0%) to $892,795, as compared to $749,992 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily attributed to a large sale to a retail customer in the amount of $497,600, which accounted for approximately 55% of the sales for nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The receivable from this sale is intended to be offset with convertible debt which the Company owes to this customer (Liquidity and Capital Resources below). The Company intends to concentrate on its domestic operations and explore additional opportunities to expand its business. However, there has been a general slowdown in the market for the Company s products.        Gross Profit        Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $55,807 (98.9%) to $628, as compared to $56,435 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease in gross profit is primarily attributed to the selling of inventory at a substantial discount to provide cash for operations. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our gross profit as a percentage of sales was 0.7% as compared to a gross profit as a percentage of sales of 42.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.         16         Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $145,446 (55.3%) to $ $408,482, as compared to $263,036 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase in gross profit is primarily attributed to the large retail sale noted above which had a high gross profit.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our gross profit as a percentage of sales was 45.8% as compared to a gross profit as a percentage of sales of 35.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.         Selling, General and Administrative Expenses        Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $74,719 (38%) and $169,300 (25.6%) to $121,685 and $491,090 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $196,404 and $660,390 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. This decrease is primarily the result of lower marketing expenses and professional fees.        Income (Loss) from Operations        As a result of the above, we had losses from operations of $121,057 and $82,608 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a losses from operations of $139,969 and $397,354 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.         Other Income (Expense)        For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had Other Expense of $32,576 as compared to Other Income of $358,426 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in Other Income is primarily attributed to the change in the fair value of the derivatives wherein for the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company had a loss of $34,026 as compared to a gain of $415,530 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had Other Expense of $12,829 as compared to Other Expense of $132,453 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in Other Expense is primarily attributed to lower amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The gain on the change in the fair value of the derivatives was mostly offset by the derivative expense.        Net Income (Loss)        As a result of the above, we had a net loss of $153,633 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net income of $218,457 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $95,437 as compared to a net loss of $529,807 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015        Liquidity and Capital Resources        The following table summarizes working capital at September 30, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015:             Over the next twelve months we believe that our existing capital combined with cash from operations as well loans from the Company s Chief Executive Officer will be sufficient to sustain our current operations. Our Chief Executive Officer has agreed to continue, from time to time as needed, to advance funds under similar terms as his current advances. It is anticipated that we will need to sell additional equity and/or debt securities in the event we locate potential mergers and/or acquisitions or require additional capital for our plan to establish retail stores.        17         Our working capital increased $55,160 primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable (see Convertible Debt below).       During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net decrease in cash of $2,893. The Company s principal sources and uses of funds were as follows:        Cash used in operating activities.        For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used $9,135 in cash for operations as compared to $248,629 in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in cash used in operations is primarily attributed change in accounts receivable offset partially by the decrease in inventory and the increase in operating income.       Cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $1,150 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $3,466 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due to a decrease in purchases of equipment.       Cash provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $7,392 as compared to $248,836 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily the result of the lower proceeds from convertible debt and bank lines of credit.       Our indebtedness is comprised of various bank credit lines, convertible debt, advances from a stockholder/officer and credit cards intended to provide capital for the ongoing manufacturing of our jewelry line, in advance of receipt of the payment from our retail distributors.        Bank Lines of Credit and Notes Payable        We have a number of various unsecured credit card obligations.  These obligations require minimal monthly payments of interest and principal and as of September 30, 2016, have interest rates ranging from 3.99% to 52.9%.  As of September 30, 2016, we have outstanding balances related to these obligations of $345,962.        Convertible Debt        From time to time the Company enters into certain financing agreements for convertible debt. For the most part, the Company settles these obligations with the Company s common stock.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding convertible debt in the amount of $622,028. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made a retail sale to a customer in the amount of $497,600. This customer holds convertible debt which the Company is obligated to pay them in the amount of approximately $428,000. The Company is currently negotiating an agreement with this customer to offset the convertible debt against the accounts receivable.         Satisfaction of Our Cash Obligations for the Next 12 Months        A critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is to efficiently manage the production of our jewelry lines and successfully develop new lines through our Company or through possible acquisitions and/or mergers. Our ability to obtain capital through additional equity and/or debt financing, and joint venture partnerships will also be important to our expansion plans. In the event we experience any significant problems assimilating acquired assets into our operations or cannot obtain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan, we may have to reduce the growth of our operations. This may materially impact our ability to increase revenue and continue our growth.       Over the next twelve months we believe that our existing capital combined with cash flow from operations and advances from our major stockholder will be sufficient to sustain our current operations.  However, in the event we locate potential acquisitions and/or mergers we will most likely need to obtain additional funding through the sale of equity and/or debt securities. There can be no assurance that if additional funding is required we will be able to secure it on terms that are favorable to us or at all.                18              Research and Development        We are not anticipating significant research and development expenditures in the near future.        Expected Purchase or Sale of Plant and Significant Equipment        We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment; as such items are not required by us at this time.        Significant Changes in the Number of Employees        We currently have three full-time employees and three part-time employees.  Of our current employees, one is in sales and marketing, two are manufacturing and three hold administrative and executive positions.  None of our employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements.  We do not anticipate a significant change in the number of full time employees over the next 12 months.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements        We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results or operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is deemed material.        Critical Accounting Policies        The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.       Our critical accounting policies are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016 (the  Annual Report ). There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in our notes to the 2015 consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report.        Recently Issued Accounting Standards        In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new standard requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020, with early application permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.       In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 ("Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting") which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.       In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 ("Leases"), which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.        19         In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 (ASC Subtopic 825-10), Financial Instruments- Overall Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this ASU require entities to measure all investments in equity securities at fair value with changes recognized through net income. This requirement does not apply to investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting, to those that result in consolidation of the investee, or for which the entity meets a practicability exception to fair value measurement. Additionally, the amendments eliminate certain disclosure requirements related to financial instruments measured at amortized cost and add disclosures related to the measurement categories of financial assets and financial liabilities. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for only certain portions of the ASU. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.       In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 (ASC Topic 740), Income Taxes Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted by all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.       In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 (ASC Topic 805), Business Combinations Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize measurement period adjustments in the period in which the adjustments are determined. The income effects of such measurement period adjustments are to be recorded in the same period s financial statements but calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date. The impact of measurement period adjustments to earnings that relate to prior period financial statements are to be presented separately on the income statement or disclosed by line item. The amendments in this update are for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.       In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (ASU 2015-15). The previous guidance in ASU 2015-03, as defined below, did not address the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-15 is effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted and entities shall apply the guidance retrospectively to all prior year periods presented. The Company is in the process of assessing the effects of the application of the new guidance.       In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ). To simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted and entities shall apply the guidance retrospectively to all prior year periods presented. The Company is in the process of assessing the effects of the application of the new guidance.       In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 that introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact, if any, it will have on its consolidated financial statements.            20         In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern , which requires management to evaluate whether conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and, if so, to provide related footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for annual or interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated Financial Statements.       In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . This ASU applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost. Under the updated guidance, an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predicable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory that is measured using last-in, last-out ( LILO ). This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim and annual reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2015-11 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.       No other recently issued accounting pronouncements had or are expected to have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.          Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk        We do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities.          Item 4. Controls and Procedures         (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures        We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Principal Executive Officer ( PEO ) and Principal Financial Officer ( PFO ), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Management designed the disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.       We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our PEO and PFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon that evaluation, the PEO and PFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective.        (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting        There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.                                 21                PART II - OTHER INFORMATION           Item 1. Legal Proceedings.        We are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect.          Item 1A. Risk Factors.        We believe there are no changes that constitute material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 20, 2016.          Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
