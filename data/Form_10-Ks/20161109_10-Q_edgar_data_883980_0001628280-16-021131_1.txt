Forward-Looking Statements  
    
  Certain matters we discuss in this Form 10-Q and in other public statements may constitute forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as  believes,   expects,   may,   will,   should,   seeks,   intends,   plans,   estimates,  or  anticipates  or similar expressions which concern our strategy, plans, projections or intentions. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, all statements we make relating to revenue, earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), earnings, margins, growth rates, and other financial results for future periods. By their nature, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made; are not statements of historical fact or guarantees of future performance; and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions or changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results could differ materially and adversely from our forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including the following: (1) adverse impacts from global economic, political, and other conditions affecting trends in consumer, business, and government spending; (2) our ability to anticipate and respond to changing industry trends, including technological changes and increasing competition; (3) our ability to successfully renew existing client contracts on favorable terms and obtain new clients; (4) our ability to prevent a material breach of security of any of our systems; (5) our ability to implement and improve processing systems to provide new products, improve functionality, and increase efficiencies; (6) our merchant alliance program which involves several alliances not under our sole control and each of which acts independently of the others; (7) credit and fraud risks in our business units and merchant alliances, particularly in the context of eCommerce and mobile markets; (8) consolidation among financial institution clients or other client groups that impacts our client relationships; (9) our ability to improve our profitability and maintain flexibility in our capital resources through the implementation of cost savings initiatives; (10) our ability to successfully value and integrate acquired businesses, including those outside of the United States; (11) our high degree of leverage; (12) adverse impacts from currency exchange rates or currency controls imposed by any government or otherwise; (13) changes in the interest rate environment that increase interest on our borrowings or the interest rate at which we can refinance our borrowings; (14) the impact of new laws, regulations, credit card association rules, or other industry standards; and (15) new lawsuits, investigations, or proceedings, or changes to our potential exposure in connection with pending lawsuits, investigations or proceedings, and various other factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015, including but not limited to, Item 1 - Business, Item 1A - Risk Factors, and Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 1A- Risk Factors in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016. Except as required by law, we do not intend to revise or update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

FIRST DATA CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited)    
   
  Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Business Description 
    
  First Data Corporation (FDC or the Company) is a global leader in commerce-enabling technology and solutions for merchants, financial institutions, and card issuers. The Company provides merchant transaction processing and acquiring; credit, retail, and debit card issuing and processing; prepaid services; and check verification, settlement and guarantee services; as well as solutions to help clients grow their businesses including the Company's Clover line of payment solutions and related applications.  
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Significant accounting policies disclosed therein have not changed. 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, they include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position of the Company, the consolidated results of the Company's operations, comprehensive income (loss), consolidated cash flows and changes in equity as of and for the periods presented. Results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year due in part to the seasonality of certain business units. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Presentation 
    
  Depreciation and amortization, presented as a separate line item on the Company s unaudited consolidated statements of operations, does not include amortization of initial payments for new contracts which is recorded as contra-revenue within  Transaction and processing service fees.  Also not included is amortization related to equity method investments which is netted within  Equity earnings in affiliates.  The following table presents the amounts associated with such amortization for the periods presented: 

Revenue Recognition 
    
  The majority of the Company s revenues are comprised of: 1) transaction-based fees, which typically constitute a percentage of dollar volume processed; 2) fees per transaction processed; 3) fees per account on file during the period; or 4) some combination thereof.  
    
  The Company s arrangements with clients often consist of multiple services and products (multiple-element arrangements).  In accounting for multiple-element arrangements, the Company assesses the elements of the contract and whether each element has standalone value and allocates revenue to the various elements based on their estimated selling price as a component of total consideration for the arrangement. The selling price is based on current selling prices offered by the Company or another party for current products or management's best estimate of a selling price.

  FIRST DATA CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

In the case of contracts that the Company owns and manages, revenue is comprised of fees charged to the client, net of interchange fees and assessments charged by the credit card associations, and is recognized at the time the client accepts a point of sale transaction. The fees charged to the client are a percentage of the credit card and signature-based debit card transaction s dollar value, a fixed amount, or a combination of the two. Personal identification number based debit (PIN-debit) and PINless-debit network fees are recognized in  Reimbursable PIN debit fees, postage, and other  revenues and expenses in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations.   STAR Network   access fees charged to clients are assessed on a per transaction basis. Interchange fees and assessments charged by credit card associations to the Company s consolidated subsidiaries and network fees related to PIN-debit and PINless-debit transactions charged by debit networks were as follows for the periods presented: 

Deferred Revenue  
    
  The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. The deferred revenue is recognized into earnings when underlying performance obligations are achieved. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , current deferred revenue included within "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities" in the Company's unaudited consolidated balance sheets was   $148 million   and   $140 million  , respectively, and noncurrent deferred revenue included within "Other long-term liabilities" in the Company's unaudited consolidated balance sheets was   $170 million   and   $146 million  , respectively.  
    
  A major component of the Company's deferred revenue represents certain Clover terminal devices which do not have standalone value as of September 30, 2016. The Company will continue to assess in the future whether an adequate secondary market is capable of developing or has developed for these devices to establish standalone value. If a secondary market is deemed capable of developing or develops whereby clients are able to substantially recover their original purchase price, the Company will recognize revenue for Clover terminal devices upon delivery.    
    
  Common Stock  
    
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   160.7 million   shares of Class B common stock were converted to   160.7 million   shares of Class A common stock. The majority of the shares converted shortly after the expiration of the Company's initial public offering lockup period which ended on April 11, 2016. 
    
  Reclassifications  
    
  Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current-year financial statement presentation. Specifically, the unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 reflects a   $123 million   reclassification related to settlement activities to conform certain international joint ventures to our global policies, which increased "Cash and cash equivalents" and decreased "Accounts receivable". The unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects the reclassification of   $123 million   within  Net Cash provided by operating activities .  
    
  New Accounting Guidance 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in an exchange for those goods or services. It also requires enhanced disclosures about revenue, provides guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively, and improves guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The guidance applies to any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. As amended in August 2015, the guidance is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 as well as interim periods within those annual periods using either the full retrospective approach or modified retrospective approach. The FASB also permitted early adoption of the standard, but not before December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets. The guidance also modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases for lessors and provides new presentation and disclosure requirements for both lessees and lessors. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period subsequent to adoption of the proceeding revenue recognition guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance that will change some aspects of the accounting for stock-based payments to employees. Under the new guidance, companies will be required to record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows. The guidance may also change how companies account for forfeitures and an employee s use of shares to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation. The new guidance will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 as well as interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company has evaluated the guidance and determined adoption will not have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that will change the accounting for credit impairment. Under the new guidance, companies are required to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposures. This new guidance will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies the treatment of several cash flow categories. In addition, the guidance clarifies that when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated, classification will depend on the predominant source or use. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company's early adoption of the guidance in the third quarter of 2016 did not have an impact on the Company's financial statements or disclosures.

Note 4: Net Income (Loss) Per Share 
  Upon First Data Holdings, Inc. (FDH), the Company's direct parent company, merging with and into FDC on October 13, 2015, all outstanding shares of FDH's Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, and Series A Voting Participating Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock) automatically converted to identical shares of the Company's stock. Following the filing of the Company's prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 15, 2015, holders of existing Class B Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock received Class B Common Stock in the Company. Other than voting rights, this common stock has the same rights as the Class A Common Stock and therefore both are treated as the same class of stock for purposes of the net income (loss) per share calculation.  
  Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to FDC by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for any potential dilutive shares. Diluted net income (loss) per share has been computed to give effect to the impact, if any, of shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of the Company s common stock equivalents, which consist of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock.  
  The following table sets forth the computation of the Company's basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods presented: 

(a) 
    2015 net loss per share, basic and diluted, is calculated using   1,000   shares outstanding prior to the merger with FDH and the filing of the Company's prospectus in October 2015.

The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were different from the statutory rate as a result of the Company recording tax expense on its foreign earnings, but not on its domestic earnings, as a result of the valuation allowance recorded in the U.S. The Company s tax expense in all periods was also impacted by the Company not recording tax expense on noncontrolling interests from pass through entities. The effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   benefited by   11%   and   5%  , respectively, from discrete adjustments.  
    
  The Company's   liability for unrecognized tax benefits was approximately   $245 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company   anticipates it is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by   up to   $122 million     over the next twelve months beginning September 30, 2016 as a result of the possible closure of federal tax audits, potential settlements with certain states and foreign countries and the lapse of the statute of limitations in various state and foreign jurisdictions.

Fair Value Measurement 
    
  The carrying amounts for the Company's derivative financial instruments are the estimated fair value of the financial instruments. The Company s derivatives are not exchange listed and therefore the fair value is estimated under an income approach using Bloomberg analytics models that are based on readily observable market inputs. These models reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, such as notional value and expiration date, as well as market-based observables including interest and foreign currency exchange rates, yield curves, and the credit quality of the counterparties. The models also incorporate the Company s creditworthiness in order to appropriately reflect non-performance risk. Inputs to the derivative pricing models are generally observable and do not contain a high level of subjectivity and, accordingly, the Company s derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. While the Company believes its estimates result in a reasonable reflection of the fair value of these instruments, the estimated values may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future.

Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Company is involved in various legal proceedings. Accruals have been made with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company. The matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in liability material to the Company s financial condition and/or results of operations. 
    
  Legal 
    
  There are asserted claims against the Company where an unfavorable outcome is considered to be reasonably possible. These claims can generally be categorized in the following areas: (1) patent infringement which results from claims that the Company is using technology that has been patented by another party, (2) merchant customer matters often associated with alleged processing errors or disclosure issues and claims that one of the subsidiaries of the Company has violated a federal or state requirement regarding credit reporting or collection in connection with its check verification guarantee and collection activities, and (3) other matters which may include issues such as employment. The Company s estimates of the reasonably possible ranges of losses in excess of any amounts accrued are   $0   to   $10 million   for patent infringement,   $0   to   $40 million   for merchant customer matters, and   $0   to   $30 million   for other matters, resulting in a total estimated range of reasonably possible losses of   $0   to   $80 million   for all of the matters described above.

The estimated range of reasonably possible losses is based on information currently available and involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties. As additional information becomes available and the resolution of the uncertainties becomes more apparent, it is possible that actual losses may exceed even the high end of the estimated range. 
    
  Other 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations to purchasers of former subsidiaries. Management of the Company believes that such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition.

  As described in note 2 "Borrowings" in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , FDC's   7.0%   senior notes are guaranteed by most of the existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly owned, domestic subsidiaries of FDC (Guarantors). The Guarantors guarantee the senior secured revolving credit facility, senior secured term loan facility, the   5.0%   senior secured notes, the   5.375%   senior secured notes, and the   6.75%   senior secured notes, which rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future unsecured and second lien indebtedness of FDC s guarantor subsidiaries to the extent of the value of the collateral. The Guarantors guarantee the   5.75%   senior second lien notes which rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of FDC s guarantor subsidiaries to the extent of the value of the collateral. The   7.0%   senior note guarantee is unsecured and ranks equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the guarantor subsidiaries but senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of FDC s guarantor subsidiaries. 
    
  All of the above guarantees are full, unconditional, and joint and several and each of the Guarantors is   100%   owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. None of the other subsidiaries of the Company, either direct or indirect, guarantee the notes (Non-Guarantors). The Guarantors are subject to release under certain circumstances as described below. 
    
  The credit agreement governing the guarantees of the senior secured revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facility provide for a Guarantor to be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from its guarantee obligations in certain circumstances, including under the following circumstances: 

the Guarantor ceases to be a  restricted subsidiary  for purpose of the agreement because the Company no longer directly or indirectly owns   50%   of the equity or, if a corporation, stock having voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors of the Guarantor; or 
                
    the Guarantor is designated as an  unrestricted subsidiary  for purposes of the agreement covenants; or 
                
    the Guarantor is no longer wholly owned by the Company subject to the value of all Guarantors released under this provision does not exceed (x)   10%   of the Company s Covenant EBITDA plus (y) the amount of investments permitted under the agreement in respect of non-guarantors. 
       
  The indentures governing all of the other guarantees described above provide for a Guarantor to be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from its guarantee obligations in certain circumstances, including upon the earliest to occur of: 

the sale, exchange or transfer of the subsidiary s capital stock or all or substantially all of its assets; 
                
    designation of the Guarantor as an  unrestricted subsidiary  for purposes of the indenture covenants; 
                
    release or discharge of the Guarantor s guarantee of certain other indebtedness; or 
                
    legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the indenture obligations when provision has been made for them to be fully satisfied.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
    
  For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our results, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This management's discussion and analysis should also be read in conjunction with the management's discussion and analysis and consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2016. 
   
  Executive Overview 
    
  We sit at the center of global electronic commerce. We believe we offer our clients the most complete array of integrated solutions in the industry, covering their needs across next generation commerce technologies, merchant acquiring, issuing, and network solutions. We serve our clients in 118 countries, reaching approximately 6 million business locations over the course of a year and over 4,000 financial institutions. We believe we have the industry s largest distribution network, driven by our partnerships with many of the world s leading financial institutions, our direct sales force, and a network of distribution partners. We are the largest merchant acquirer, issuer processor, and independent network services provider in the world, enabling businesses to accept electronic payments, helping financial institutions issue credit, debit and prepaid cards, and routing secure transactions between them. In 2015, we processed 79 billion transactions globally, or over 2,500 per second. In our largest market, the United States, we acquired $1.7 trillion of payment volume, accounting for nearly 10% of U.S. GDP. 
    
  Our business is characterized by transaction related fees, multi-year contracts, and a diverse client base, which allows us to grow alongside our clients. Our multi-year contracts allow us to achieve a high level of recurring revenues with the same clients. While the contracts typically do not specify fixed revenues to be realized thereunder, they do provide a framework for revenues to be generated based on volume of services provided during such contracts term. Our business also generally requires minimal incremental capital expenditures and working capital to support additional revenue within our existing business lines. 
  Our Strategy 
    
  Our ability to grow our business is influenced by global expenditure growth, increasing our share in electronic payments and providing value-added products and services. We grow our business through diversification of product offerings such as credit, debit, prepaid, Clover, and our suite of security products. We believe we offer our clients the most complete array of integrated solutions in our industry, covering their needs across next-generation commerce technology, merchant acquiring, issuing, and network solutions. We believe this differentiates us from our competition and will continue to drive our growth in the future.   
  We work with a variety of partners to deliver our solutions. We help merchants by delivering data-driven insights and other services to help them grow and create better and secure purchase experiences for consumers across all commerce platforms. We assist merchants in day to day operations of their business via our Clover line of products which enables merchants to more efficiently run their businesses, build customer loyalty, and gain valuable insights which help grow their businesses. We provide financial institutions with solutions to help them grow their revenues, enhance customer satisfaction, and deliver their products more timely and efficiently.  
    
  We continue to execute on key initiatives:  
             
    Tangible improvements in North America merchant business 
                
    Strong momentum in international markets  
                
    Enterprise growth continues 
                
    Maintaining expense discipline

Components of Revenue 
    
  We generate revenue by providing commerce-enabling solutions. Our major components of revenue have not changed from those discussed within  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations 
    
  As a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations are not comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods. Key factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations are summarized below. 
    
  Currency Impact 
    
  Although the majority of our revenue is earned in U.S. dollars, a portion of our revenues and expenses are in foreign currencies. As a result, changes in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar can impact our results of operations. Additionally, we have intercompany debts in foreign currencies, which impacts our results of operations. In recent periods, the U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly against most foreign currencies, which has negatively impacted our revenues generated in foreign currencies as presented in U.S. dollars in our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We believe the presentation of constant currency provides relevant information and we use this non-GAAP financial measure to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to foreign currency fluctuations. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). For additional information on our constant currency calculation, see  Segment Results  within this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  As a result of our capital market activities over the past few years, we have lowered the average interest rate of our outstanding borrowings from 7.4% as of December 31, 2014 to 5.3% as of   September 30, 2016  . In addition, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred $18 million in fees to modify existing long-term debt which is recorded within "Interest expense, net" in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations.  
    
  Debt Extinguishment Costs 
    
  We incurred   $3 million   and   $58 million   of losses on debt extinguishment during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. We recorded   $108 million   on debt extinguishments during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
    
  The table below shows the stock-based compensation expense split between Cost of services and Selling, general, and administrative expense. 

Stock based compensation expense increased for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   over the corresponding prior year periods, as we recognized $52 million in expense in the first quarter of 2016 that was directly associated with our initial public offering and began recognizing stock based compensation expense over the respective service period which commenced upon the completion of our initial public offering on October 15, 2015. See note 3  Stock Compensation Plans  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information about our stock compensation plans.

Restructuring and Cost Management Initiatives  
    
  During the second quarter, we successfully achieved over $200 million in annualized gross savings from our previously announced cost management initiative. As a result of these initiatives, and our cost management focus, we have increased segment EBITDA margin by over 300 basis points since December 31, 2013. To achieve these savings, we incurred approximately $105 million in restructuring charges. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $6 million   and   $51 million  , respectively, in restructuring charges. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $20 million   and   $40 million  , respectively, in restructuring charges. See note 9  Restructuring  to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information about our restructuring and cost savings initiatives. 
   
  Results of Operations  
  Consolidated results should be read in conjunction with note 5 "Segment Information" to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the unaudited consolidated statements of operations. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated within the consolidated results. 
  Overview 
    
  Net income attributable to First Data Corporation for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   improved to   $132 million   from a net loss of   $126 million   during the same period in   2015  . The improvement in net income is attributable to improved operating results, lower interest expense of   $125 million  , and lower debt extinguishment cost of $105 million, partially offset by an increase of   $35 million   in stock-based compensation expense and a $31 million loss on divestiture of an international business unit. 
    
  Net income attributable to First Data Corporation for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   improved to   $228 million   from a net loss of   $264 million   during the same period in   2015  . The improvement is attributable to improved operating results, lower interest expense of   $389 million  , lower debt extinguishment charges of $50 million, and a $29 million gain on the Visa Europe share sale, partially offset by an increase of   $183 million   in stock-based compensation expense, a $17 million increase in other operating expenses, and a $31 million loss on divestiture of an international business unit. 
  Segment Results 
    
  We operate three reportable segments: Global Business Solutions, Global Financial Solutions, and Network   Security Solutions. Our segments are designed to establish global lines of businesses that work seamlessly with our teams in our regions of North America (United States and Canada), EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), LATAM (Latin America and Caribbean region), and APAC (Asia Pacific). 
    
  The business segment measurements provided to and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker are computed in accordance with the principles listed below: 

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. 

Intersegment revenues are eliminated in the segment that sells directly to the end market. 

Segment revenue excludes reimbursable PIN debit fees, postage, and other revenue. 

Segment EBITDA includes equity earnings in affiliates and excludes depreciation and amortization expense, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, other operating expenses, and other income (expense). Additionally, segment EBITDA is adjusted for items similar to certain of those used in calculating our compliance with debt covenants. The additional items that are adjusted to determine segment EBITDA are: 

stock-based compensation and related expenses are excluded; 
                
    debt issuance costs are excluded and represent costs associated with issuing debt and modifying our debt structure; and 
     
   34 

Table of Contents  

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts   Co. (KKR) related items including annual sponsor and other fees for management, consulting, financial, contract termination, and other advisory services are excluded. Upon our public offering on October 15, 2015, we are no longer required to pay management fees to KKR. 

For significant affiliates, segment revenue and segment EBITDA are reflected based on our proportionate share of the results of our investments in businesses accounted for under the equity method and consolidated subsidiaries with noncontrolling ownership interests. For other affiliates, we include equity earnings in affiliates, excluding amortization expense, in segment revenue and segment EBITDA. In addition, our Global Business Solutions segment measures reflect revenue-based commission payments to Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs) and sales channels, which are treated as an expense in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations, as contra revenue. 

Corporate operations include corporate-wide governance functions such as our executive management team, tax, treasury, internal audit, corporate strategy, and certain accounting, human resources and legal costs related to supporting the corporate function. Costs incurred by Corporate that are attributable to a segment are allocated to the respective segment. 

Certain measures exclude the estimated impact of foreign currency changes (constant currency). To present this information, monthly results during the periods presented for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding month of the prior fiscal year, rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. Once translated, each month during the periods presented is added together to calculate the constant currency results for the periods presented.

Global Business Solutions segment results 
  The following table displays total segment revenue by region and illustrates, on a percentage basis, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue growth for the periods presented: 

(a) 
    North American merchant transactions include acquired Visa and MasterCard credit and signature debit, American Express and Discover, PIN-debit, electronic benefits transactions, processed-only and gateway customer transactions at the Point of Sale (POS). North American merchant transactions reflect 100% of alliance transactions. 
              (b) 
    International transactions include Visa, MasterCard, and other payment network merchant acquiring transactions for clients outside the U.S. and Canada. Transactions include credit, signature debit, PIN-debit POS, POS gateway, and Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions. 
       
  Global Business Solutions Segment revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   3%   on a constant currency basis as we experienced constant currency revenue growth in North America, EMEA, and LATAM. North America revenue growth was driven by net pricing growth resulting in an increase of approximately $13 million from certain fee increases which only impacted the third quarter of 2016 and $12 million from other non-recurring items. North American hardware revenue declined $26 million as 2015 benefited from the roll-out of Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV). Processing revenue was impacted by   7%   transaction growth mostly offset by lower blended yield. The decline in blended yield reflects the impact of both pricing and shift in mix within our overall portfolio. Declines were partially offset by an increase in software sales of approximately $5 million as a result of growth in our merchant suite of products. Constant currency revenue growth in EMEA was largely driven by growth in transaction volume. Constant currency revenue growth in our LATAM region was driven by revenue growth in our Brazil market of approximately $9 million and growth in Argentina of approximately $7 million. APAC revenue declined due to lower ATM fees in Australia.  
    
  Global Business Solutions Segment revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   2%   on a constant currency basis as we experienced constant currency growth in our EMEA and LATAM regions. North America revenue growth declined as lower hardware sales of $39 million were partially offset by an increase of $23 million in software sales as a result of growth in our merchant suite of products, including the initial roll-out of Transarmor Solutions. In addition, the year to date period benefited by approximately $15 million from other non-recurring items. Processing revenue declined as transaction growth of   7%   was offset by lower blended yield, which reflects the impact of attrition within our SMB portfolio. Constant currency revenue growth in our EMEA region was driven by volume growth and an approximate $10 million benefit from changes in interchange pricing during the first quarter of 2016. Constant currency revenue growth in our LATAM region was driven by revenue growth in our Brazil market of approximately $26 million and growth in Argentina of approximately $20 million. APAC revenue declined due to lower ATM fees in Australia.  
    
  North America transaction growth for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   was driven largely by growth within our third-party distribution channels. International transaction growth for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   outpaced revenue growth due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements as well as strong transaction volume growth in all international regions.

Global Financial Solutions segment results 
  The following table displays total revenue by segment region and illustrates, on a percentage basis, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue growth for the periods indicated: 

(a) 
    North America card accounts on file reflect the total number of bankcard credit and retail credit accounts as of the end of the periods presented. 
              (b)  
    International card accounts on file reflect total bankcard and retail accounts outside the United States and Canada as of the end of the periods presented.  
       
  Global Financial Solutions Segment revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   5%   on a constant currency basis compared to the same period in   2015   led by growth across all regions. North America revenue growth was driven by growth in our print business and our credit and retail card processing businesses. Our print business grew by approximately $9 million principally due to a new enterprise win from an existing customer. Credit and retail processing grew by approximately $5 million from an increase in card accounts on file. The growth in our print and processing businesses was partially offset by a $6 million decline within our plastics business. The plastics decline is largely attributed to strong prior year growth related to EMV implementation volumes. EMEA constant currency revenue growth was driven by a $6 million increase in professional services revenue and a $4 million increase in ATM sales. Included within professional services revenue growth is approximately $3 million of growth attributed to non-recurring revenue items.  LATAM constant currency revenue growth was primarily driven by strong growth in Argentina of $5 million and Colombia of $3 million. APAC constant currency revenue growth was driven by growth in professional services. 
    
  Global Financial Solutions Segment revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   10%   on a constant currency basis compared to the same periods in   2015   led by growth across all regions. North America revenue growth was driven by growth in our plastics and print businesses of $33 million and our credit and retail card processing businesses of $28 million. Growth in print and plastics was driven by higher print volumes primarily from new business and plastics growth resulting from EMV card issuances. Credit and retail processing growth was driven by an increase in card accounts tied to growth from existing clients and new business. EMEA constant currency revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in professional services. LATAM constant currency revenue growth was driven by strong growth in Argentina and $13 million from contract modifications and resolution of license fee disputes.  
    
  North America card accounts on file increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   from growth in existing clients. International accounts on file increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to new portfolios of existing clients throughout all of our international regions.

              (b) 
    Network transactions include the debit issuer processing transactions,   STAR Network   issuer transactions, and closed loop and open loop POS transactions. 
       
  Network   Security Solutions revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   1%   compared to the same period in   2015   driven by growth within our Security and Fraud product category, partially offset by declines within our Stored Value business. EFT Network revenue was relatively flat as STAR growth was offset by the impact of a long-term debit processing contract renewal. Stored value network revenue was down   3%  , partly driven by the timing of card shipments in our open loop business. Security and Fraud revenue increased due to growth from our suite of security and fraud products, partially offset by revenue declines within our TeleCheck business of $7 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Network   Security Solutions revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   3%   compared to the same period in   2015   driven by growth within our Stored Value Network and Security and Fraud product categories. EFT Network revenue was flat as STAR growth was offset by the impact of a long-term debit processing contract renewal. Stored Value Network revenue increased due to growth in our closed loop gift card business. Security and Fraud revenue increased due to growth from our suite of security and fraud products, partially offset by revenue declines within our TeleCheck business of $16 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Network transaction growth for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   was driven by growth in all network transaction categories.  

Reimbursable PIN debit fees, postage, and other    
    
  Reimbursable PIN debit fees, postage, and other   revenue remained flat for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  . 
    
  Reimbursable PIN debit fees, postage, and other   revenue increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   due to transaction and volume growth related to PIN debit fees of $33 million and print and plastics mailing services of $31 million.

Operating expenses overview 

Cost of services    

Cost of services   expense increased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to  a   $19 million   increase in stock-based compensation, $8 million increase in merchant credit losses, and a $10 million increase in outside professional services, partially offset by the benefit of foreign currency exchange movements. Stock based compensation expense increased as we began recognizing expense over the respective service period which commenced upon the completion of our initial public offering. Merchant credit losses have increased due to higher fraud rates and charge-backs resulting from a liability shift post EMV implementation. Outside professional services expense increased as we continue to invest in our operating businesses.  
    
  Cost of services   expense increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to a   $91 million   increase in stock-based compensation of which $22 million relates to expenses associated with our initial public offering. Outside professional services, software, and infrastructure expenses increased as we continue to invest in our core operating businesses. Other expenses declined as the first half of 2015 was negatively impacted by two client-related matters totaling $25 million. In addition, included within other expenses is an increase of approximately $20 million in merchant credit losses. Merchant credits losses increased due to higher fraud rates and charge-backs resulting from a liability shift post EMV. Expense increases were partially offset by the benefit of foreign exchange rate movements.  
    
  Cost of products sold 
    
  Cost of products sold   expense decreased for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   driven by lower hardware sales.

Selling, general, and administrative 

Selling, general, and administrative   expense decreased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to benefits from our strategic expense management initiative during the current period and a decline in retail ISO commissions, partially offset by increased stock-based compensation of   $16 million  . Retail ISO commissions declined approximately $15 million in North America due to consolidation of retail ISOs to wholesale ISOs via acquisition. The decline was partially offset by growth of ISO commissions in EMEA.  
    
  Selling, general, and administrative   expense remained flat for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The growth in stock-based compensation expense was split between expenses associated with our initial public offering of approximately $30 million and recurring expenses of approximately $62 million, which commenced with the completion of our initial public offering last year. The increase in stock based compensation expense was offset by decreases in other salary based compensation and outside professional services expenses, as we experienced benefits from our strategic expense management initiative during 2016.  
    
  Depreciation and amortization 

Depreciation expense   increased for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to higher capital expenditure investments over the past several years.  
    
  Amortization expense   decreased for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to a reduction in amortization expense on acquisition intangibles. 
    
  Other operating expenses, net    
    
  Other operating expenses   decreased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due to a decline in restructuring costs incurred as part of our expense management initiative, partially offset by approximately $5 million in current quarter expense from settlement of a client related matter.

  Reimbursable PIN debit fees, postage, and other   expense increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   due to transaction and volume growth related to PIN debit fees of $33 million and print and plastics mailing services of $31 million. 

Interest expense, net   

Interest expense, net   decreased significantly for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   due to lower outstanding debt balances as a result of debt extinguishments and lower interest rates as a result of debt paydowns and refinancing activity during the second half of 2015 and the first six months of 2016. Interest expense, net for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   includes $18 million of fees incurred to modify long term debt.

Gain on Visa Europe share sale  
    
  On June 21, 2016, Visa Inc. (Visa) acquired Visa Europe (VE), of which we were a member and shareholder through certain subsidiaries. On June 21, 2016, we received cash of  24.2 million ($27 million equivalent at June 21, 2016) and Visa preferred stock which is convertible into Visa common shares. We will also receive a deferred payment three years after the closing date of the acquisition, valued at approximately  2.3 million ($2.6 million equivalent at June 21, 2016).  As of June 21, 2016, the Class A common stock equivalent of the preferred stock was approximately $19 million. However, the preferred shares have been assigned a value of zero based on transfer restrictions and Visa's ability to adjust the conversion ratio dependent on the outcome of existing and potential litigations in the Visa Europe territory over the next 12 years. We could receive additional proceeds as a number of First Data subsidiaries are working with certain members of Visa Europe who sponsor other of our merchant acquiring businesses in Europe in respect of sale proceeds received by those members.

Divestitures, net (loss) gain 
    
  On September 30, 2016, we completed the sale of our Australian ATM business, which was reported as part of the Global Business Solutions segment. Associated with the transaction, we recognized a $31 million loss on the sale. The loss is comprised of investments of $69 million reduced by anticipated cash proceeds of $38 million. 
    
  Non-operating foreign currency gains (losses)  
    
  As of January 1, 2016, all of our euro-denominated debt was designated as a hedge against our net investment in our euro-denominated business units, with the gain (loss) recognized through comprehensive income (loss). The gain recognized within "Other income (expense)" during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was driven by gains on intercompany loans. The gain for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   relates to currency translations on our euro-denominated debt, which is now hedged, and on our intercompany loans. The gain during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was driven by the U.S. dollar strengthening 8% against the euro.  

Income taxes 

The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were different from the statutory rate as a result of recording tax expense on our foreign earnings, but not on our domestic earnings, as a result of the valuation allowance recorded in the U.S. Our tax expense in all periods was also impacted by us not recording tax expense on noncontrolling interests from pass through entities. The effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 benefited by 11% and 5%, respectively, from discrete items. 
    
  Our   liability for unrecognized tax benefits was approximately   $245 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . We anticipate it is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to   $122 million     over the next twelve months beginning September 30, 2016 as a result of the possible closure of federal tax audits, potential settlements with certain states and foreign countries and the lapse of the statute of limitations in various state and foreign jurisdictions.    
    
  Following the recognition of significant deferred tax valuation allowances in 2012, we have regularly experienced substantial volatility in our effective tax rate in interim periods and across years. This is due to deferred income tax benefits not being recognized in several jurisdictions, most notably in the United States, and changes in the amount, mix, and timing of pretax earnings in tax paying jurisdictions that can have a significant impact on the overall effective tax rate. This interim and full year volatility is likely to continue in future periods until it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards and the deferred tax valuation allowances are released. 

Equity earnings in affiliates 

Equity earnings in affiliates   increased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to revenue growth within our Wells Fargo Merchant Services JV and lower amortization expense of $2 million. 
    
  Equity earnings in affiliates   increased for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to revenue growth within our Wells Fargo Merchant Services JV and lower amortization expense of $11 million.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest   increased during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   driven by transaction volume growth and the $4 million benefit from certain fee increases which only impacted the third quarter of 2016 within our Bank of America Merchant Services alliance.

  Adjusted Net Income 
  Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that provides an alternative view of performance used by management which the Company believes enhances investors' understanding of our internal assessment of performance. Adjusted net income excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and other items affecting comparability and therefore, are not reflective of continuing operating performance. The presentation of adjusted net income and other non-GAAP financial measures provide investors greater transparency into ongoing results of operations allowing investors to better compare our results from period to period. The adjusted net income measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP reported net income. 
  The following table reconciles the reported net income (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted net income for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  :

    The tax effect of the adjustments between our GAAP and adjusted results takes into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. effective tax rate for certain adjustments, including the majority of amortization of intangible assets, deferred financing costs, stock compensation, and loss on debt extinguishment; whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable effective tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. Income tax (expense) benefit also includes the impact of significant discrete tax items impacting Net income (loss) attributable to First Data Corporation. 
       
  Adjusted net income   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   improved due to better operating performance and lower interest expense.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our source of liquidity is principally cash generated from operating activities supplemented as necessary on a short-term basis by borrowings against our senior secured revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility. We believe our current level of cash and short-term financing capabilities along with future cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet the ongoing needs of the business. To the extent future cash flows exceed the ongoing needs of the business, we may use all or a portion of the excess cash to reduce our debt balances. 
    
  Over the past few years, we completed various amendments and modifications to several of our debt agreements in an effort to extend our debt maturities and lower interest rates. Our current level of debt may limit our ability to get additional funding beyond our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility if needed at our current funding rate. Details regarding our debt structure are provided in note 2 "Borrowings" in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Debt restructuring and refinancing activities 
    
  In the first quarter of 2016, we redeemed our 8.75% senior secured second lien notes due 2022 and $887 million of our senior secured term loan facility due March 2018. We also issued $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior secured notes due 2024. Associated with these transactions we recorded $46 million in loss on debt extinguishment. 
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, our U.S. dollar-denominated senior secured term loan due March 2018 was refinanced through new and existing lenders to provide approximately $3.7 billion of senior secured term loans due March 2021. The senior secured term loan due March 2021 bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 400 basis points or a base rate plus 300 basis points. In connection with this transaction, we recorded approximately $5 million in loss on debt extinguishment and incurred $11 million in debt issuance costs.  
    
  Also in the second quarter of 2016, our senior secured term loan due September 2018 and euro-denominated senior secured term loan due March 2018 were refinanced through new and existing lenders to provide approximately $1.0 billion and approximately  311 million ($342 million equivalent), respectively, of senior secured term loans due July 2022. The senior secured term loans due July 2022 bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 375 basis points or, solely with respect to the U.S. dollar denominated term loans, a base rate plus 275 basis points. In connection with this transaction, we recorded $4 million in loss on debt extinguishment and incurred $4 million in debt issuance costs.  
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, we paid down $350 million aggregate principal amount of our March 2021 senior secured term loans. In connection with this transaction, we recorded $3 million in loss on debt extinguishment.  
    
  Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2016, we paid down $100 million aggregate principal amount of our March 2021 senior secured term loans. We recorded an immaterial amount of loss on debt extinguishment in connection with this transaction. 
    
  Also subsequent to the end of the third quarter, our senior secured term loan due March 2021 was refinanced through new and existing lenders to provide approximately $4.5 billion (including    0.2 billion   of euro denominated term loans) of new senior secured term loans due March 2021. The new senior secured term loan due March 2021 bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 300

  Total borrowings and net debt  
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used excess cash generated by the business along with existing cash on our unaudited consolidated balance sheet to pay down outstanding borrowings. The chart below shows the net debt balances as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as total long-term borrowings plus short-term and current portion of long-term borrowings, at par value, excluding lines of credit used for settlement purposes, less cash and cash equivalents. We believe that net debt provides additional insight on the level and management of leverage. Net debt is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for total outstanding GAAP borrowings.  

(a)  
    As of September 30, 2016, "Cash and cash equivalents" reflects a reclassification of $123 million related to settlement activities to conform certain international joint ventures to our global policies, which increased "Cash and cash equivalents" and decreased "Accounts receivable" in our consolidated balance sheet.  
       
  Credit ratings 
     
  As of November 9, 2016, our long-term corporate family rating from Moody s was B1 (outlook stable). The long-term local issuer credit rating from Standard and Poor s was B+ (stable). The long-term issuer default rating from Fitch was B (positive). A decrease in our credit ratings could affect our ability to access future financing at current funding rates, which could result in increased interest expense in the future. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents    
    
  Investments (other than those included in settlement assets) with original maturities of three months or less (that are readily convertible to cash) are considered to be cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which approximates market value. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held   $475 million   and   $429 million   in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. 
    
  Included in cash and cash equivalents are amounts held by our domestic subsidiaries, Banc of America Merchant Services and Integrated Payment Systems, that are not available to fund operations outside of those subsidiaries. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the cash and cash equivalents held by these subsidiaries totaled $127 million and $136 million, respectively. All other domestic cash balances, to the extent available, are used to fund our short-term liquidity needs.   
    
  Cash and cash equivalents include amounts held outside of the U.S., totaling $320 million and $161 million as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately $240 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries that was unavailable for general corporate purposes. We plan to fund any international cash needs throughout the remainder of 2016 within our international operations with cash held by our international entities, but if necessary, could fund such needs using cash from the United States, subject to satisfying debt covenant restrictions  .

Cash flows  

Cash flows from operating activities 
  Our operating cash flow is impacted by our level of debt. Approximately   $759 million   and $1.3 billion in cash interest was paid during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease in cash interest payments is driven by lower principal balances due to debt extinguishments and refinancings and a significant decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our debt. 
  The chart below reconciles the change in operating cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .

              (b) 
    The nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes a $123 million reclassification related to settlement activities to conform certain international joint ventures to our global policies, which increased "Cash and cash equivalents" and decreased "Accounts receivable" in our consolidated balance sheet. 
       
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , net income, excluding other operating expenses and other income (expense) increased due to the items noted previously within "Results of Operations." Working capital increased $188 million from the timing of interest payments and accruals and $88 million from the settlement of three cross-currency swaps. In addition, working capital improved due to the timing of our working capital requirements, operational improvements, particularly improvements in accounts receivable and inventory, and a $123 million reclassification related to settlement activities to conform certain international joint ventures to our global policies. The working capital improvements were partially offset by two supplier signing bonuses received in the prior year. 
    
  Free Cash Flow 
    
  Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, distributions to minority interests and other items. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and users of our financial statements about the amount of cash generated by the business which can then be used to, among other things, reduce outstanding debt. Free cash flow is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP reported financial information. 
  Free cash flow was   $946 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of $948 million from the same period in 2015. The increase is primarily driven by improved operating results, reduced cash interest payments, and lower capital expenditures. The decrease in capital expenditures is due to an $86 million increase in new capital leases and $17 million from the impact of foreign exchange rates compared to the prior period. The chart below reconciles cash flow from operations to free cash flow for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Free cash flow excludes the impact of reclassification. 
      
  Cash flows from investing activities 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities decreased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   due to a $106 million reduction in capital expenditures, $89 million of acquisitions in the prior year, $27 million of cash received from our investment in Visa Europe, and $17 million of investments purchased in the prior year. The decreases were partially offset by an $8 million investment in an international joint venture in the current year. 
    
  For a more detailed discussion on the consideration received from our investment in Visa Europe discussed above, refer to note 12 "Supplemental Financial Information" to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
   
  Cash flows from financing activities 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to principal payments on long-term debt. Principal payments on long-term debt, including payments of call premiums and debt-related costs, net of proceeds from new debt issuances increased $1.1 billion for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . Additionally, cash flows used in financing activities increased due to $250 million of borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facility in the prior year and $59 million of taxes paid for the net settlement of equity awards. These increases were partially offset by $208 million of proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization facility. 
    
  Senior secured revolving credit facility 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our senior secured revolving credit facility had commitments from financial institutions to provide $1.25 billion of credit. The revolving credit facility matures on June 2, 2020. Besides the letters of credit discussed below, we had no outstanding balances against this facility as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , $1.2 billion remained available under the facility. Excluding the letters of credit, the maximum amount outstanding against this facility during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately $430 million while the average amount outstanding during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately $160 million. 
    
  The senior secured revolving credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. We utilize our senior secured revolving credit facility to fund investing or financing activities when cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient. We believe cash on hand and cash flow generated through our normal operating activities in conjunction with the capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. 
    
  There are multiple institutions that have commitments under this facility with none representing more than 18% of remaining capacity. 
    
  Accounts receivable securitization agreement 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $208 million of outstanding borrowings and $326 million of pledged receivables under our accounts receivable securitization agreement. The securitization can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The maximum borrowing capacity allowed under the accounts receivable securitization agreement was $240 million as of   September 30, 2016  . For additional information regarding our accounts receivable securitization agreement, refer to note 2 "Borrowings" to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

    Total available without giving effect to amounts outstanding. 
              (b) 
    Outstanding letters of credit are held in connection with lease arrangements, bankcard association agreements and other security agreements. The largest amount of letters of credit outstanding was approximately $43 million during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . All letters of credit expire on or prior to March 31, 2017 with a one-year renewal option. We expect to renew most of the letters of credit prior to expiration. 
              (c) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , represents $325 million of committed lines of credit as well as certain uncommitted lines of credit and other agreements that are available in various currencies to fund settlement and other activity. We cannot use these lines of credit for general corporate purposes. Certain of these arrangements are uncommitted but, as of the dates presented, we had borrowings outstanding against them. 
       
  In the event one or more of the aforementioned lines of credit becomes unavailable, we will utilize our existing cash, cash flows from operating activities, or our senior secured revolving credit facility to meet our liquidity needs. 
   
  Covenant compliance   Under the senior secured revolving credit and term loan facilities, certain limitations, restrictions, and defaults could occur if we are not able to satisfy and remain in compliance with specified financial ratios. We have agreed that we will not permit the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt to Covenant EBITDA (both as defined in the agreement) ratio for any 12 month period (last four fiscal quarters) to be greater than 6.0 to 1.0. 
  The breach of this covenant could result in a default under the senior secured revolving credit facility and the senior secured term loan credit facility and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Any such acceleration could also result in a default under the indentures for the senior secured notes, senior notes, and senior subordinated notes. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all applicable covenants, including our sole financial covenant with Consolidated Senior Secured Debt of   $12.6 billion  , Covenant EBITDA of   $3.4 billion   and a Ratio of   3.8   to 1.0. 
    
  In determining Covenant EBITDA, EBITDA is calculated by reference to net income (loss) from continuing operations plus interest and other financing costs, net, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Covenant EBITDA is calculated by adjusting EBITDA to exclude certain items as permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the credit facilities. Covenant EBITDA is further adjusted to add net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest of certain non wholly owned subsidiaries and exclude other miscellaneous adjustments that are used in calculating covenant compliance under the agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities. We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Covenant EBITDA are appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate our ability to comply with our financing covenants. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of Covenant EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. Our assets include cash equivalents as well as both fixed and floating rate interest-bearing securities. These investments arise primarily from settlement funds held by us pending settlement. 
    
  Our interest rate-sensitive liabilities are our debt instruments. Our senior secured term loan facility is subject to variable interest rates. For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , $5 billion of our variable to fixed interest rate swaps matured and we entered into new variable to fixed interest rate collar swaps on $3 billion of our variable rate debt. The interest rate collar swaps mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations, but are subject to contractual ceilings and floors. The interest rate collar swaps provide for interest rate protection if one month LIBOR rises above 150 basis points. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have $8.5 billion in variable rate debt, $3 billion of which is subject to the interest rate collar swaps.  
        
  Based on the   September 30, 2016   balances, a 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates on an annualized basis compared to the interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  , which for the one month LIBOR was 0.5311%, and a corresponding and parallel shift in the remainder of the yield curve, would result in a decrease to pretax income of approximately $70 million. The $70 million decrease to pretax income (due to a 100 basis point increase in variable rates as of   September 30, 2016  ) is due to an $85 million increase in interest expense related to our balance of variable interest rate debt, net of interest rate collars. The interest rate collars provide a hedge on $3 billion of notional variable rate debt if one month LIBOR rises above 150 basis points. The increase in interest expense would be partially offset by a $15 million increase in interest income. A decrease in interest rates would result in an increase to pretax income. Actual interest rates could change significantly more than 100 basis points. There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rate movements are linear and instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect income. 
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 
    
  We are exposed to changes in currency rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations, revenues generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and foreign currency-denominated loans. Revenue and profit generated by international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Refer to note 8 "Derivative Financial Instruments" to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
    
  A hypothetical uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all the currencies in which our revenues and profits are denominated would result in an increase to pretax income of approximately $22 million. This increase results from a $21 million increase related to foreign exchange on foreign currency earnings, assuming consistent operating results as the twelve months preceding December 31, 2015, and a $5 million increase related to foreign exchange on intercompany loans. The increase is partially offset by $4 million related to euro-denominated term loans held by us. There is inherent limitation in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange movements are linear and instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect income. 
    
  Regulatory 
    
  Through our merchant alliances, we hold an ownership interest in several competing merchant acquiring businesses while serving as the electronic processor for those businesses. In order to satisfy state and federal antitrust requirements, we actively maintain an antitrust compliance program.

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
       
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  We have evaluated, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . This is done in order to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that are filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  During 2015, we commenced the migration of certain activities in connection with our strategic expense management initiative. This migration continues to present transitional risks to maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. To mitigate this risk, management continues to strengthen its entity level controls via enhanced financial reporting analytical reviews. Other than with respect to this migration, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the above evaluation that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  OPTION AGREEMENT 
  FIRST DATA CORPORATION 
  2015 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
  Subject to the terms of the First Data Corporation 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (Plan), First Data Corporation (First Data) and the Participant (you) agree as follows: 
  1.      Definitions  . Whenever the following terms are used in this Option Agreement (Agreement), they have the meanings below. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement have the meanings defined in the Plan. 
  1.1      Exercise Price  . The term Exercise Price means the exercise price on your Grant Notice. 
  1.2      Grant Date  . The term Grant Date means the date on your Grant Notice. 
  1.3      Option Period  . The term  Option Period  means the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the 10   th    anniversary of the Grant Date. 
  1.4      Grant Notice  . The term  Grant Notice  means the document attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement.  
  2.      Grant of Options  . First Data grants to you the right and option to purchase all or any part of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock subject to the options on your Grant Notice (the Options, with each Option representing the right to purchase one share of Common Stock), at an Exercise Price per share on your Grant Notice.  
  3.      Vesting  . The Options will vest as follows: 
  3.1      Continuous Employment  . As long as you have not experienced a Termination before each applicable vesting date, one-third of the Options will vest and become exercisable on the first anniversary of the Grant Date, one-third of the Options will vest and become exercisable on the second anniversary of the Grant Date and the remaining one-third of the Options will vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary of the Grant Date (each anniversary, a Vesting Date). Upon vesting, the Options will be rounded down to the nearest whole Option. 
  3.2      Termination  . In the event of your Termination before the last Vesting Date, you will forfeit any unvested Options for no consideration. However, if your Termination occurs because of your Disability or death, any outstanding Options will become fully vested and exercisable upon your Termination. 
  4.      Exercise of Options after Termination  . The terms of Section 7(c)(2) of the Plan are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference and made a part of this Agreement, except that if your Termination occurs because of your Disability or death, your vested Options will remain exercisable for three years after your Termination (but in no event beyond the expiration of the Option Period).  
  5.      Method of Exercising Options  . You may exercise all or any portion of the vested Options by delivering notice of the number of shares that are being exercised together with full payment of the Exercise Price for the portion of the Options being exercised. The notice must be in writing to either First Data or a third-party administrator engaged by First Data. Payment of the Exercise Price may be made using the methods described in Section 7(d)(1) or Section 7(d)(2)(C) of the Plan. 
  6.      Issuance of Shares  . Following the exercise of all or any portion of the Options, as promptly as practical after receipt of full payment of the Exercise Price and any required taxes, First Data will issue or transfer to you the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option has been exercised, and either (1) deliver to you a certificate or certificates for the shares registered in your name, (2) cause the shares to be registered in book-entry form on First Data s stock register, or (3) cause the shares to be credited to your account at a third-party administrator. 
  7.      Non-Transferability  . You may not transfer the Options except as permitted under Section 14(b) of the Plan. 

8.      Confidential Information; Non-Compete; Non-Solicit; Clawback/Forfeiture  . 
  8.1    In consideration of First Data granting you the Options, you agree that you will not directly or indirectly: 
  8.1.1    at any time during or after your Termination, use, disclose or disseminate any Confidential Information or Trade Secrets about the business of First Data or any Affiliate. These obligations do not apply to any Confidential Information or Trade Secret that has become generally known to competitors of First Data or any Affiliate through no act or omission of yours. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits or impedes you from communicating, cooperating or filing a complaint with any U.S. federal, state or local governmental or law enforcement branch, agency or entity (collectively, a Governmental Entity) concerning possible violations of any U.S. federal, state or local law or regulation, or otherwise making disclosures to any Governmental Entity, in each case, that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of any such law or regulation, as long as in each case the communications and disclosures are consistent with applicable law. You are not authorized to disclose any information covered by First Data s or any Affiliate s attorney-client privilege or attorney work product or Trade Secrets without the written consent of the Board or its designee; 
  8.1.2    at any time during your service with First Data or any Affiliate and for a period of two years following Termination, act as a proprietor, investor, director, officer, employee, stockholder, consultant or partner in any business that directly or indirectly competes, at the relevant determination date, with First Data s business or any Affiliate s business in any geographic area where First Data or any Affiliate manufactures, produces, sells, leases, rents, licenses or otherwise provides products or services. This section does not restrict you from investing in publicly-available mutual funds or exchange-traded funds; and 
  8.1.3    at any time during your service with First Data or any Affiliate and for a period of two years following Termination, (A) solicit customers or clients of First Data or any Affiliate to terminate their relationship with First Data or any Affiliate or solicit those customers or clients to compete with any business of First Data or any Affiliate or (B) solicit or offer employment to any person who is, or has been at any time during the 12 months before the Termination, employed by First Data or any Affiliate. 
  8.2    If you are bound by any other agreement with First Data or any Affiliate regarding the use, dissemination or disclosure of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets, the terms of this Agreement will be read in such a way as to further restrict and not to permit any more extensive use, dissemination or disclosure of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets. 
  8.3    If a court holds that the restrictions stated in Section 8 are unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable, the maximum period, scope or geographic area determined to be reasonable by the court will be substituted for the stated period, scope or area. Because your services are unique and because you have had access to Confidential Information and/or Trade Secrets, money damages will be an inadequate remedy for any breach of this Agreement. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, First Data may, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of this Agreement. 
  8.4    If you have engaged in or engage in any Detrimental Activity, then the Committee may take any action permitted under the Plan, including: (1) canceling the Options; or (2) requiring that you forfeit any gain realized on the exercise of the Options or the sale of any shares received upon exercise of the Options and repay that gain to First Data. In addition, if you receive any amount greater than what you should have received under the terms of this Agreement for any reason, then you must repay any excess amount to First Data. The Options will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law.  
  9.      No Rights as Stockholder  . Neither you nor any Permitted Transferee of the Options will have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any share of Common Stock underlying an Option until you have become the holder of record or the beneficial owner of the share. Further, no adjustment will be made for dividends or distributions or other rights for any share of Common Stock for which the record date is before the date that you become the holder of record or the beneficial owner of the share.  
  10.      Tax Withholding  . This Award will be subject to all applicable taxes as provided in Section 14(d) of the Plan. 

11.      Notice  . Every notice or other communication relating to this Agreement between First Data and you must be in writing. All notices and communications between you and any third-party plan administrator must be mailed, delivered, transmitted or sent according to that third-party plan administrator s procedures.  
  12.      Binding Effect  . This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and successors of the parties to this Agreement.  
  13.      Waiver and Amendments  . The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or alter, suspend, discontinue, cancel or terminate, this Agreement, prospectively or retroactively, except that your consent will be required for any waiver, amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance, cancellation or termination that would materially and adversely affect your rights. No waiver by either of the parties to this Agreement of their rights will constitute a waiver of any subsequent occurrences or transactions unless the waiver specifically states that it is to be construed as a continuing waiver. The Committee s rights under this Section 13 may be subject to stockholder approval as required under Section 13(b) of the Plan. 
  14.      Governing Law; Forum  . This Agreement will be construed and interpreted under the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law. If any controversy among the parties arises out of, or relates to, this Agreement, you and First Data agree and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts of New Castle County in the State of Delaware. 
  15.      Plan  . The terms of the Plan are incorporated into this Agreement and made a part of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of the Plan and this Agreement, the Plan will control. You acknowledge that a copy of the Plan (which is publicly-filed) has been made available to you, as well as a prospectus describing the terms of the Plan.  
  16.      Imposition of Other Requirements  . First Data may impose any other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the Options granted under this Agreement and on any shares acquired under the Plan, if First Data determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. First Data may also require you to sign any additional agreements that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing. 
  17.      Entire Agreement  . The information on your Grant Notice, this Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between you and First Data regarding the Options granted under this Agreement.

  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT  
  FIRST DATA CORPORATION 
  2015 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
  Subject to the terms of the First Data Corporation 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (Plan), First Data Corporation (First Data) and the Participant (you) agree as follows: 
  1.      Definitions  . The term  Grant Date  means the date on specified in the grant notice attached as Exhibit A (Grant Notice). Other capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement have the meanings defined in the Plan. 
  2.      Grant of Restricted Shares  . First Data grants to you the number of shares of Restricted Stock included on your Grant Notice (Restricted Shares). 
  3.      Vesting  . The Restricted Period for the Restricted Shares will lapse and the Restricted Shares will vest as follows: 
  3.1      Continuous Employment  . As long as you have not experienced a Termination before each applicable vesting date, 20% of the Restricted Shares will vest on the first anniversary of the Grant Date, 40% of the Restricted Shares will vest on the second anniversary of the Grant Date, and the remaining 40% of the Restricted Shares will vest on the third anniversary of the Grant Date (each anniversary, a Vesting Date). Upon vesting, the Restricted Shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole share of Common Stock. 
  3.2      Termination  . In the event of your Termination before the last Vesting Date, you will forfeit any unvested Restricted Shares for no consideration. However, if your Termination occurs because of your Disability or death, any outstanding Restricted Shares will become fully vested and the Restricted Period for those Restricted Shares will lapse upon your Termination. 
  4.      Non-Transferability  . You may not transfer the Restricted Shares except as permitted under Section 14(b) of the Plan. 
  5.      Confidential Information; Non-Compete; Non-Solicit; Clawback/Forfeiture  . 
  5.1    In consideration of First Data granting you the Restricted Shares, you agree that you will not directly or indirectly:  
  5.1.1    at any time use, disclose, or disseminate any Confidential Information or Trade Secrets about the business of First Data or any Affiliate. These obligations do not apply to Confidential Information or Trade Secrets that have become generally known to competitors of First Data or any Affiliate through no act or omission of yours. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits or impedes you from communicating, cooperating, or filing a complaint with any U.S. federal, state, or local governmental or law enforcement branch, agency, or entity (collectively, a Governmental Entity) concerning possible violations of any U.S. federal, state, or local law or regulation, or otherwise making disclosures to any Governmental Entity, in each case, that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of any such law or regulation, as long as in each case the communications and disclosures are consistent with applicable law. You are not authorized to disclose any information covered by First Data s or its Affiliates  attorney-client privilege or attorney work product or Trade Secrets without the written consent of the Board or its designee; 
  5.1.2     at any time during your service with First Data or any Affiliate and for a period of two years following Termination, act as a proprietor, investor, director, officer, employee, stockholder, consultant, or partner in any business that directly or indirectly competes, at the relevant determination date, with First Data s business or any Affiliate s business in any geographic area where First Data or any Affiliate manufactures, produces, sells, leases, rents, licenses, or otherwise provides products or services, except that this section does not restrict you from investing in publicly-available mutual funds or exchange-traded funds; or 

5.1.3    at any time during your service with First Data or any Affiliate and for a period of two years following Termination, (1) solicit customers or clients of First Data or any Affiliate to terminate their relationship with First Data or any Affiliate or solicit those customers or clients to compete with any business of First Data or any Affiliate or (2) solicit or offer employment to any person who is, or has been at any time during the 12 months before your Termination, employed by First Data or any Affiliate.  
  5.2    If you are bound by any other agreement with First Data or any Affiliate covering the use, dissemination, or disclosure of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets, the terms of this Agreement will be read in a way to further restrict and not to permit any more extensive use, dissemination, or disclosure of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets.  
  5.3    If a court holds that the restrictions stated in this Section 5 are unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable, the maximum period, scope, or geographic area determined to be reasonable by the court will be substituted for the stated period, scope, or area.

  6.      Stockholder Rights  . Subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 9 of the Plan, you generally will have the rights and privileges of a First Data stockholder as to the Restricted Shares on the Grant Date, including the right to vote the Restricted Shares.

Exhibit 10.3 
    
  Description of Modifications of Award Agreements 
    
  On August 2, 2016, the Board of Directors approved the following modifications of all outstanding equity awards for owner-associates to accelerate vesting of all unvested equity if an owner-associate dies or is permanently disabled. Equity awards outstanding on that date have been amended in the following manner:  
    
  Amendments to Time-Vesting Awards 
    
  For outstanding stock awards that vest based on an owner-associate s continued service only (and do not contain a performance-vesting feature), those awards will now vest 100% if the owner-associates  employment terminates due to disability or death.  
    
  Amendments to Performance-Vesting Awards 
    
  For outstanding stock awards that vest based on an owner-associates  continued service and the achievement of a performance goal or goals, if employment terminates due to disability or death, an owner-associates will not forfeit those awards upon termination, but instead will continue to vest as if the owner-associates remained employed with First Data for three years following disability or death. All of the other terms of the owner-associates  awards will continue to apply following termination. 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  For owner-associates  outstanding stock options, in addition to the amendments to the vesting terms described above, if an owner-associates  employment terminates due to disability or death, an owner-associates  vested options will now remain exercisable for three years following disability or death (but not later than the original option period). 
    
  No Other Changes 
    
  Except as described above, an owner-associates outstanding award under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan remain unchanged.
