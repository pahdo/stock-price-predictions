1. 
 
 Nature and continuance of operations

IGEN Networks Corp, ( IGEN , or the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 14, 2006. IGEN s is in the business of providing vehicle tracking and recovery solutions to the automotive and power sport industries through its operating subsidiary, Nimbo, LLC.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which imply the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, on the ability of the company to grow its revenue base, on its ability to successfully grow the companies in which it is invested, and on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to both support the latter objectives and to invest in and grow new companies. The Company has recurring losses since inception and had accumulated losses of $8,226,719 as at September 30, 2016.  These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Although there are no assurances that management s plans will be realized, management believes that the Company will be able to continue operations into the future.  These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

2. 
 
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a) 
 
 Basic of presentation and consolidation

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes include the records of IGEN Networks Corp., its wholly owned subsidiary, IGEN Business Solutions Inc (incorporated in Canada) and Nimbo LLC (incorporated in USA).

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, expressed in US dollars, and, in management s opinion, have been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized as in the following:

b) 
 
 Use of estimates

The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to deferred expenses, deferred revenue and deferred income tax asset valuations. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.

c) 
 
 Loss per share

Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted earnings per share give effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options, using the treasury stock method, and convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted earnings (loss) per share, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted earnings (loss) per share exclude all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

2. 
 
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

c)    Loss per share (continued)

Because the effect of conversion of the Company s dilutive securities is anti-dilutive, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the periods presented.

d)    Financial instruments

The Company adopted FASB ASC 820-10-50,  Fair Value Measurements . This guidance defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follows:

- Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

- Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

- Level 3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement.

The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. Foreign currency transactions are primarily undertaken in Canadian dollars. The fair value of cash is determined based on  Level 1  inputs and the fair value of derivative liability with convertible debt is determined based on  Level 2  inputs. The financial risk is the risk to the Company s operations that arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility to these rates. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. Financial instrument that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consists of cash. The Company places its cash in what it believes to be credit-worthy financial institutions.

e) 
 
 Equipment

Office equipment and computer are recorded at cost. Amortization is provided annually at rates and methods over their estimated useful lives as follows, except in the year of acquisition when one half of the rate is used. Management reviews the estimates of useful lives of the assets every year and adjust them on prospective basis, if needed.

Office equipment

20% declining balance

Computer

55% declining balance

Software

3 years straight line

Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in the circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the total of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset during the year the impairment occurs. Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of office equipment is capitalized when it is probable that future economic benefits from the use of the assets will be increased.

 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

f)     Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when earned, specifically when all the following conditions are met:

- Services are provided or products are delivered to customers.

- There is clear evidence that an arrangement exists.

- Amounts are fixed or can be determined.

- The ability to collect is reasonably assured.

- There is no significant obligation for future performance.

- The amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated.

g) 
 
 Foreign currency transaction balances

The Company s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The consolidated financial statements of the Company are translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation Matters, using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income.

Assets and liabilities of the Company s Canadian subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Exchange differences arising on translation are disclosed as a separate component of stockholders  equity

h) 
 
 Income taxes

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued FASB ASC 740-10. FASB ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with prior literature FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more likely than not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements. As a result of the implementation of this standard, the Company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with recognition and measurement standards established by FASB ASC 740-10.

Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

i) 
 
 Stock-based compensation

The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. This model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are not limited to the Company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period.

l)     Changes in accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements

The Company has not adopted any new accounting policies since it most recent year ended December 31, 2015.

3. 
 
 Investment in an associate

As at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company held approximately 30% of all the outstanding shares of Gogiro Internet Group ( Gogiro ), a private Canadian Company. The Company accounts for its investments in Gogiro with equity method. Consequently the Company has included Gogiro s income (losses) in the Company s condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance to the percentage ownership during three months ended March 31, 2015. In addition, gains and losses resulting from  upstream  and  downstream  transactions between IGEN and Gogiro are recognized in IGEN s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors  interests in Gogiro.

As at December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the Company reviewed the recoverability of the investment in Gogiro and concluded that the investment was fully impaired. As a result, the Company recorded impairment charges of $227,957 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and fully provided for its investment in Gogiro.

Continuity of the Company s share purchase warrant is as follows:

The number of outstanding warrants as at September 30, 2016 was 2,129,524. As at September 30, 2016, the weighted average exercise price and weight average remaining life of the warrants was $0.25/share (2015/12/31-$0.32/share) and 1.07 years (2015/12/31   1.45 years).

7.       Derivative liabilities   options and warrants 

Derivate liabilities consist of warrants that were originally issued in private placements and stock options granted that have exercise prices denominated in Canadian dollars, which differs from the Company s functional currency (United States dollars). Therefore these warrants and stock options cannot be considered to be indexed to the Company s own stock. Accordingly the fair values of the warrants and stock options must be accounted for as derivative liabilities with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.  The fair value of these warrants and options as at September 30, 2016 was $19,569 (2015/12/31 - $33,982). The fair values of warrants and stock options as at December 31, 2015 were determined using the Binomial option pricing model the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of 0.86%-1.54%, expected life of 1.37-5.00 years, volatility of 103.19%-176.96% and expected dividend of 0%. The fair values of warrants and stock options as at September 30, 2016 were determined using the Binomial option pricing model the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of 0.59% to 0.73%, expected life of 1.37-4.25 years, volatility of 88.19%-111.10% and expected dividend of 0%.

8.       Note payable 

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company issued a promissory note with principal of $95,000 in exchange for a settlement of accounts payable of the same amount. This promissory is un-secured, will expire on December 31, 2016, and carries interest of 5% per annum. During the third quarter of 2016, a payment of $5,000 was made on the note payable to bring the principal balance down to $90,000.

The note payable was accounted for at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method with the effective interest rate of 14% per annum. The debt discount of $16,163 was credited to Additional paid-in capital at issuance, and the $16,163 debit to note payable is amortized over the term of the note.

The promissory note was accredited up to $87,874 on September 30, 2016 (2015/12/31 -$87,238). Including in the Company s accrued liabilities, there was an interest payable of $12,085 as at (2015/12/31 - $5,938) in connection with this outstanding promissory note.

As at September 30, 2016, the Company also had a promissory note payable of $30,840 owing to a director of the Company (Note 5).

9.       Financial instruments 

Credit Risk 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company deposits cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions as determined by rating agencies.  As a result, credit risk is considered insignificant.

Currency Risk 

The Company s major expenses and payables are in United States dollars and are expected to continue to incur in United States dollars.  Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currency may have a material effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.  The Company is subject to foreign exchange risk for transactions in its Canadian subsidiary and its investment in Gogiro, which is a Canadian company. The Company does not actively hedge against foreign currency fluctuations.

9.       Financial instruments (continued) 

Interest Rate Risk 

The Company has cash balances and no interest bearing debt. The Company s current policy is to invest excess cash in high yield term deposits and bankers  acceptance. The Company regularly monitors its cash management policy. As a result, interest rate risk is considered not significant.

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The Company manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring actual and projected cash flows and matching the maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities. As at September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $851,603 (December 31, 2015   working capital deficiency of $536,863). The Company intends to have more equity financing, long term debt financing, share for debt settlement in order to eliminate the working capital deficiency and to the operations of the Company.

10.     Convertible debenture and derivative liabilities 

On September 1, 2016, the Company issued two convertible debentures ( CDs ) in the principal of CAD$50,000 ($38,634) and CAD$20,000 ($15,453) respectively. The CD with the principal of CAD$50,000 ( CD#1) and the CD with the principal of CAD$20,000 ( CD#2 ) were agreed to mature on four month anniversary of the closing date of September 8, 2016 (i.e. October 8, 2016).  These CDs are non-secured, carry interest of 15% per annum payable monthly or at term. Subject to the approval of the holder of the CDs, IGEN may convert any of all of the principal and/or interest at any time following the 4 month anniversary of the issuance date of the CDs into common shares of IGEN at a price per share equal to a 20% discount to the fair market value of IGEN s common share.

As the CDs are denominated in Canadian dollars (a currency different from the functional currency of the Company) and the exercise prices are not fixed (a 20% discount to the fair market value of IGEN s common share), a derivative is recognized as a liability. The derivative liability is recorded at fair value and re-measured each period with the movement being recorded as a gain or loss in consolidated income (loss).  The CDs are classified as a liability, less the portion relating to the derivative feature. During the period ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded derivative liabilities of $20,104 and convertible notes of $38,663. The fair value of derivative liabilities was established by using the valuation technique, the Binomial option pricing model. Assumptions used in the option pricing model were as follows: average risk free interest rate   0.22%; expected life   0.35 year; expected volatility   52%%; and expected dividends   nil.

The Company records accretion expense over the term of the convertible notes up to their principal when these CDs come due.  During the period ended September 30, 2016, accretion expense of $4,680 (2015 - $nil) was recorded. Interest expense on the CDs is composed of the interest calculated on the face value of the CDs at 15% per annum which amounted to $2,688 during the period ended September 30, 2016 (2015 - $nil).

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Current Assets and Liabilities, Working Capital, Net Debt

As of September 30, 2016 the Company s current assets were $325,983, an 86% increase over the nine-month period, and a 100% increase over the quarter.  This was due primarily to a large increase in accounts receivables stemming from increased volume of product and services shipped and invoiced during the quarter.  Inventory levels dropped over the quarter to 2015 year-end levels, due primarily to an increased percentage of hardware orders being fulfilled directly from factory to customer.

Current liabilities increased over the quarter by $200,580 (or 23%) to $1,088,364.  $78,333 of this increase was deferred revenues that account for pre-paid services invoiced in the quarter but which are to be delivered and converted to earned revenue over the following year.  $124,376 of the increased liabilities was due to an increase in accounts payable, primarily for hardware and the provision of wireless services. 

The Company finished the third quarter with a working capital deficiency of ($762,381), a decrease of (225,518) over the nine-month period, but only of (35,097) or 5% over the quarter. The Company intends to improve its working capital position through ongoing equity and debt financing and continued focus on growth in its cash flow.

The Company monitors its net debt 1  to ensure that its capital structure is maintained by a strong balance sheet to fund its future growth. Net debt is used in this document in the context of liquidity and is calculated as the total of the Company s current liabilities, less deferred revenue and derivative liabilities, less current assets.  There is no U.S. GAAP measure that is reasonably comparable to net debt. The Company s net debt for the period ended September 30, 2016 was $608,444, down from $651,680 at the end of the previous quarter.  This reduction was due primarily to increased gross profit and deferred revenues generated during the period.

In October 2016, the Company raised an additional $38,143 in equity financing and also converted the $56,340 of convertible debentures into shares.  These transactions are further disclosed in the subsequent events note 12 of the financial statements.

Total Assets and Liabilities, Net Assets

The Company s total assets as of September 30, 2016 was $841,437, a net increase in total assets over the quarter and nine-month period of $162,927 and $142,742 respectively.  This increase was commensurate with the respective changes in current assets previously discussed; changes in noncurrent assets were not significant.

Table of Contents 

Total liabilities increased $280,102 over the quarter to $1,197,155.  This increase was composed primarily of the $200,580 increase in current liabilities previously discussed combined with $89,222 in new non-current deferred revenue.  Deferred revenue which is non-current accounts for pre-paid services that are to be provided beyond a one-year timeframe.  This liability is eventually converted first to current deferred revenue as it comes within one year, and then to recognized or earned revenue.

The above resulted in net assets of ($355,718), a decrease over the quarter of ($117,715) and the nine-month period of ($308,024).  However, a total of $223,055 in liabilities contributing to this was due to deferred revenue, both current and longer term, that will eventually become earned. 

As of the date these financial statements were issued the Company believes it has access to adequate working capital and projected net revenues to maintain existing operations for approximately three months without requiring additional funding.  The Company s business plan is predicated on raising further capital for the purpose of further investment and acquisition of targeted technologies and companies, to fund growth in these technologies and companies, and to expand sales and distribution channels for companies it currently owns or is invested.  It is anticipated the Company will continue to raise additional capital through private placements and debt financing in the both the near and medium term.

Results of Operations

Revenues and Net Income (Loss)

Revenues

The company had third quarter revenues of $376,476.  This was up significantly from the $178,087 reported in Q2, and up 11% over the similar quarter in 2015.  Revenues for the nine-month period were $828,570, up 3% over the similar period in 2015.

The quarterly and nine-month revenues reported belie the fact that the company had its most successful quarter to date in terms of sales orders booked, shipped and invoiced.  The Company actually invoiced a total of $544,031 in Q3, compared with $355,366 invoiced in Q1 and Q2 combined.  The difference between total invoiced orders for Q3 of $544,031, and the reported revenues of $376,476, is $167,555 of revenue which the Company deferred due to it being pre-paid and associated with future services.

Gross profit for the second quarter was $86,797, up from $77,775 in Q2, but down from the $121,683 reported for the similar period in 2015.  However, for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2015 the company saw $304,865 of gross profit, up 7% over the same period in 2015, and the largest gross profit reported for any similar nine-month period in the Company s history.

As with revenue, the gross profit and resulting gross margins were significantly reduced due to the need to defer $167,555 of pre-paid revenue invoiced in the quarter.  As a result, gross margins for the quarter were only 23%.  In spite of this, gross margins for the nine-month period ending September 31, 2016 were still 37%, up from 35% reported for the similar period in 2015.

The Company continues to review hardware, inventory, and order fulfillment strategies as well as product and service pricing and delivery models to try to grow sales and maximize overall margins. It is anticipated that an increased percentage of hardware sales will have the effect of both increasing revenue while continuing to potentially reduce blended margin percentages.

In late Q2 and early Q3 the company implemented a pricing model based on initial lower margin sales of services and hardware that is pre-loaded in automotive dealership lots, with follow-on high margin revenue generated by subsequent sell-through to end customers.   In September the Company announced its largest single revenue order through its Verizon channel as part of this new pricing model and delivery of these and follow-on orders were completed in Q3 and continue into Q4.  High-margin sell through of services began to materialize in Q3, leading to increased invoicing and cash flow, but also increased deferred revenues.  The Company anticipates this pricing, margin, and revenue recognition model will continue to grow through Q4 and into 2017.

Expenses

Expenses for Q3 2016 totaled $244,287, down from $302,448 reported in the previous quarter. Though sales commissions were up significantly (due to increased sales in the quarter), the company saw larger reductions in consulting, G A, and management costs.

The company anticipates however that management, consulting and salary costs will increase in the fourth quarter due to planned hiring.  Q3 expenses were significantly lower than the those reported for the same period in 2015, but in the latter period significant non-cash stock-based compensation was reported.  However even without including SBC costs, and therefore on an adjusted and non-GAAP basis, Q3 2016 expenses were 19.7% lower than the same period in 2015.  Expenses for the nine-month period were down significantly, again primarily to much less stock-based compensation reported in 2016.  If SBC is not included, and therefore on an adjusted and non-GAAP basis, expenses for the nine-month period in 2016 were up 7.7% over the similar period in 2015. 

Net Income (Loss)

The Company had a Q3 2016 net loss of ($149,690), an improvement over both the ($211,803) reported for the previous quarter and the ($601,287) reported for the same period in 2015.  The nine-month period had a net loss of ($551,167) compared with ($938,106) over the same period in 2015.  However, as with expenses, comparing net income meaningfully with the similar periods in 2015 is obfuscated somewhat by the stock based compensation reported in Q3 2015.  Not including this non-cash expense, and therefore on an adjusted and non-GAAP basis, the net loss in Q2 2016 was 22% less compared to the same quarter in 2015, and the net loss in the nine-month period in 2016 was up 7.7% over the same period in 2015.

It is instructive to point out that the net loss reported in Q3 is impacted by the need to defer revenues, and does not necessarily paint an accurate description of the Company s income.  Cash (or receivables) are received in the quarter, which contribute to cash flow, but a large percentage ($167,555) cannot be reported as revenue, as the services paid for have yet to be provided, resulting in a quarterly loss of ($157,490).  However from a purely cash-basis, the company is actually generating cash.  For purely comparison purposes, if deferred revenues are included in income, and non-cash expenses are not included, and therefore on an adjusted and non-GAAP basis 1 , the Company created $17,121 in funds flow from operations.

The Company continues to invest in personnel and programs as necessary to drive revenue growth, increased gross profit, and to enable the Company to become cash flow positive.

Cash Flows and Cash Position

The company saw an increase of $18,402 in cash over the nine-month period.   Net cash of $189,849 used in operating activities   essentially the same as that used in the previous quarter, and down from the $206,510 used in the same period in 2015 - was offset by net financing cash of $220,040 raised via private placements, option exercises and debt conversion.  Cash at the end of the period was $51,992.

Non-GAAP Measures

This document contains the terms  funds flow from operations , and  net debt  which are not recognized measures under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

a)           The Company considers funds flow from operations to be a key measure that indicates the Company s ability to generate the funds necessary to support future growth through capital investment and to repay any debt. Funds flow from operations is a measure that represents cash generated by operating activities, including deferred revenue generated in the period, before changes in non-cash working capital, and may not be comparable to measures used by other companies. Funds flow from operations per share is calculated using the same weighted-average number of shares outstanding, as in the case of the earnings per share calculation for the period. 

A reconciliation of funds flow from operations to cash provided by operating activities is presented as follows:

b)          Net debt (working capital) is closely monitored by the Company to ensure that its capital structure is maintained by a strong balance sheet to fund its future growth. Net debt is used in this document in the context of liquidity and is calculated as the total of the Company s current liabilities, less deferred revenue and derivative liabilities, less current assets.  There is no U.S. GAAP measure that is reasonably comparable to net debt. 

The following table outlines the Company calculation of net debt:
