BLACK BOX CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

Note 1: Business and Basis of Presentation 
  Business 
  Black Box Corporation ("Black Box," or "the Company ) is a leading technology solutions provider dedicated to helping customers design, build, manage, and secure their IT infrastructure. The Company offers Products and Services that it distributes through two platforms it has built over its 40-year history. The Products platform provides networking solutions through the sale of products including: (i) IT infrastructure, (ii) specialty networking, (iii) multimedia and (iv) keyboard/video/mouse ("KVM") switching. The Services platform is comprised of engineering and design, network operations centers, technical certifications, national and international sales teams, remote monitoring, on-site service teams and technology partner centers of excellence which includes dedicated sales and engineering resources. The primary services offered through this platform include: (i) communications lifecycle services, (ii) unified communications, (iii) structured cabling, (iv) video/AV services, (v) in-building wireless and (vi) data center services. Founded in 1976, Black Box, a Delaware corporation, is headquartered near Pittsburgh in Lawrence, Pennsylvania. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Black Box have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The Company believes that these consolidated financial statements reflect all normal, recurring adjustments needed to present fairly the Company s results for the interim periods presented. The results as of and for interim periods presented may not be indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016   (the "Form 10-K"). 
  The Company s fiscal year ends on March 31. The fiscal quarters consist of   13   weeks and end on the Saturday generally nearest each calendar quarter end, adjusted to provide relatively equivalent business days for each fiscal quarter. The actual ending dates for the periods presented in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. References herein to "Fiscal Year" or "Fiscal" mean the Company s fiscal year ended March 31 for the year referenced. All references to dollar amounts herein are presented in thousands, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted. 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain items in the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported net income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, total assets or total stockholders' equity. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires Company management ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates in these financial statements include project progress towards completion to estimated budget, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, sales returns, net realizable value of inventories, loss contingencies, warranty reserves, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management believes the estimates made are reasonable. 
   
  Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies 
  Significant Accounting Policies 
  The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements within the Form 10-K. No additional significant accounting policies have been adopted during Fiscal   2017  .

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  There have been no accounting pronouncements adopted during Fiscal   2017   that have had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Note 3: Inventories 
  The Company s Inventories consist of the following: 

During 2Q17, the Company incurred $9,137 of Inventory impairment loss, which included $2,810 in North America Products due to a write-down to lower of cost or market as a result of specific legacy networking product discontinuation and excess inventory given the current demand outlook for North America Products, and $6,327 in North America Services due to a write-down to lower of cost or market as a result of excess inventory given current demand in commercial services within North America Services. The Company is focused on maximizing asset utilization and working capital efficiencies and these reductions will increase cost efficiency in future periods.  Based on the demand reviews completed, resulting in the stated inventory impairment loss, the Company does not expect further inventory impairments during Fiscal 2017.  
   
  Note 4: Intangible Assets 
  The following table summarizes the gross carrying amount, accumulated amortization and net carrying amount by intangible asset class: 

The Company s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist solely of the Company s trademark portfolio. The Company s definite-lived intangible assets are comprised of employee non-compete agreements, customer relationships and backlog obtained through business acquisitions.

Note 5: Indebtedness 
  The Company s Long-term debt consists of the following: 

On May 9, 2016, the Company refinanced its then existing   $200,000   credit facility pursuant to a new credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and certain other lender parties. The Credit Agreement expires on May 9, 2021.  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are permitted up to a maximum amount of   $200,000  , and includes up to   $15,000   of swing-line loans and   $25,000   of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement may be increased by the Company up to an additional   $50,000   and may be unilaterally and permanently reduced by the Company to not less than the then outstanding amount of all borrowings. Interest on outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement accrues, at the Company s option, at a rate based on either: (a) a Base Rate Option equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds open rate, plus fifty (50) basis points (  0.5%  ), (ii) the bank s prime rate, and (iii) the daily LIBOR rate, plus 100 basis points (  1.0%  ), in each case plus   0%   to   1.00%   (determined by a leverage ratio based on the Company s consolidated EBITDA) or (b) a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus   1.00%   to   2.00%   (determined by a leverage ratio based on the Company s consolidated EBITDA). The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain compliance with certain non-financial and financial covenants such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. The Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company s material direct and indirect subsidiaries that are incorporated (or organized) under the laws of the District of Columbia or under the laws of any state or commonwealth of the United States and are guaranteed by such domestic subsidiaries. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
    
  The maximum amount of debt outstanding under the Credit Agreement, the weighted-average balance outstanding under the Credit Agreement and the weighted-average interest rate on all outstanding debt for the three-months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $145,100  ,   $131,973   and   2.6%  , respectively, compared to   $183,050  ,   $172,037   and   1.9%  , respectively, for the three-months ended   September 30, 2015  . The maximum amount of debt outstanding under the Credit Agreement, the weighted-average balance outstanding under the Credit Agreement and the weighted-average interest rate on all outstanding debt for the   six  -months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $150,075  ,   $132,643   and   2.5%  , respectively, compared to   $183,050  ,   $166,494   and   1.9%  , respectively, for the   six  -months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $4,850   outstanding in letters of credit and   $93,750   in unused commitments, which are limited by a financial covenant, under the Credit Agreement.

Note 6: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  The Company is exposed to certain market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. It does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative trading purposes. The Company is exposed to non-performance risk from the counterparties in its derivative instruments. This risk would be limited to any unrealized gains on current positions. To help mitigate this risk, the Company transacts only with counterparties that are rated as investment grade or higher and all counterparties are monitored on a continuous basis. The fair value of the Company s derivatives reflects this credit risk. 
  The Company enters into foreign currency contracts to hedge exposure to variability in expected fluctuations in foreign currencies. All of the foreign currency contracts have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of any changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI") until the hedged forecasted transaction occurs or the recognized currency transaction affects earnings. Once the forecasted transaction occurs or the recognized currency transaction affects earnings, the effective portion of any related gains or losses on the cash flow hedge is reclassified from AOCI to the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had open contracts in Australian and Canadian dollars, Danish krone, Euros, Mexican pesos, Norwegian kroner, British pounds sterling, Swedish krona, Swiss francs and Japanese yen, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges. These contracts had a notional amount of   $53,849   and will expire within   8   months. There was no hedge ineffectiveness during Fiscal   2017   or Fiscal   2016  . 
  The following tables summarize the carrying amounts of derivative assets/liabilities and the impact on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations:

Note 7: Fair Value Disclosures 
  Recurring fair value measurements 
  The following table presents information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016  , and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value: 

(1) The fair value of pension plan assets is measured annually, thus this value is as of   March 31, 2016  . 
  Non-recurring fair value measurements 
  The Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include non-financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination. 
   
  Note 8: Stockholder's Equity 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
  The components of AOCI consisted of the following for the periods presented: 

Dividends 
  The following table presents information about the Company's dividend program: 

While the Company expects to continue to declare quarterly dividends, the payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") and the timing and amount of any future dividends will depend upon earnings, cash requirements and the financial condition of the Company. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is permitted to make regularly quarterly dividends not exceeding   $15,000   per year as long as no Event of Default or Potential Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall have occurred and is continuing or shall occur as a result thereof. In addition, the Company is permitted to make other distributions or dividends if such event would not violate a   3.00   to 1.00 consolidated leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement.

Common Stock Repurchases 
  The following table presents information about the Company's common stock repurchases: 

During the   six  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company made tax payments of   $477   and withheld   39,735   shares of common stock, which were designated as treasury shares, at an average price per share of   $12.01  , in order to satisfy employee income taxes due as a result of the vesting of certain restricted stock units. During the   six  -month period ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company made tax payments of   $796   and withheld   40,176   shares of common stock, which were designated as treasury shares, at an average price per share of   $19.80  , in order to satisfy employee income taxes due as a result of the vesting of certain restricted stock units. 
  Since the inception of its repurchase programs beginning in April 1999 and through   September 30, 2016  , the Company has repurchased   11,194,933   shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $406,661  , or an average purchase price per share of   $36.33  . These shares do not include the treasury shares withheld for tax payments due upon the vesting of certain restricted stock units and performance shares. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   1,305,067   shares were available under the most recent repurchase programs. Additional repurchases of common stock may occur from time to time depending upon factors such as the Company s cash flows and general market conditions. There can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of such repurchases. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is permitted to repurchase its common stock as long as no Event of Default or Potential Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall have occurred and is continuing or shall occur as a result thereof. In addition, no repurchase of common stock is permitted, with certain exceptions, under the Credit Agreement if the Company's consolidated leverage ratio (based on EBITDA) exceeds   3.00  . At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's leverage ratio was   2.79  . 
   
  Note 9: Income Taxes 
  The Company's benefit for income taxes for the three-months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1,524  , an effective tax rate of   20.0%   on loss before provision for income taxes of   $7,629  , compared to   $21,512  , an effective tax rate of   14.2%   on loss before provision for income taxes of   $151,357   for the three-months ended   September 30, 2015  . The effective tax rate   increase  d from   14.2%   to   20.0%   was primarily due to the deferred tax write-off of equity awards. The effective tax rate for the   six  -months ended   September 30, 2016   of   20.0%   differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to mix of income across various taxing jurisdictions. The Company's provision for income taxes for the   six  -months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $808  , an effective tax rate of   (14.0)%   on loss before benefit for income taxes of   $5,773  , compared to a benefit for income taxes of   $19,438  , an effective tax rate of   13.1%   on loss before benefit for income taxes of   $148,529   for the   six  -months ended   September 30, 2015  . The effective tax rate decrease from   13.1%   to   (14.0)%   was primarily due to due to mix of income across various taxing jurisdictions. 
  The Company provides for income taxes at the end of each interim period based on the estimated effective tax rate adjusted for certain discrete items for the full fiscal year. Cumulative adjustments to the Company's estimate are recorded in the interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective rate is determined. 
  Fiscal 2013 through Fiscal 2016 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and Fiscal 2011 through Fiscal 2016 remain open to examination by certain state and foreign taxing jurisdictions.

Note 10: Stock-based Compensation 
  In August 2008, the Company s stockholders approved the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Incentive Plan"), which replaced the 1992 Stock Option Plan, as amended, and the 1992 Director Stock Option Plan, as amended. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Incentive Plan is authorized to issue stock options, restricted stock units and performance shares, among other types of awards, for up to   5,799,395   shares of common stock, par value   $0.001   per share (the "common stock"). 
  The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of   $939   and   $869   for the three-months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $3,172   and   $3,148   for the   six  -months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company recognized total income tax benefit for stock-based compensation arrangements of   $349   and   $332   for the three-months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1,180   and   $1,201   for the   six  -months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Selling, general   administrative expense within the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  Stock options 
  Stock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the common stock on the date of grant; such stock options generally become exercisable in equal amounts over a   three  -year period and have a contractual life of   ten  -years from the grant date. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes the following weighted-average assumptions. 

The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activity: 

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the   six  -months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $3.74   and   $7.79  , respectively. The intrinsic value of options exercised during the   six  -months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $0   and   $0  , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table is based on the closing stock price of the common stock on   September 30, 2016  , which was   $13.90  .

     Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes certain information regarding the Company s non-vested stock options: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $1,657   of total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.3   years. 
  Restricted stock units 
  Restricted stock unit awards are subject to a service condition and typically vest in equal amounts over a   three  -year period from the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of restricted stock units granted and the closing market price of the common stock on the date of grant. 
  The following table summarizes the Company s restricted stock unit activity: 

The total fair value of shares that vested during the   six  -months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $2,039   and   $2,979  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $3,669   of total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.2   years. 
  Performance share awards 
  Performance share awards are subject to one of the performance goals - the Company's Relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") Ranking or cumulative Adjusted EBITDA - each over a   three  -year period. The Company s Relative TSR Ranking metric is based on the three-year cumulative return to stockholders from the change in stock price and dividends paid between the starting and ending dates. The fair value of performance share awards (subject to cumulative Adjusted EBITDA) is determined based on the number of performance shares granted and the closing market price of the common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of performance share awards (subject to the Company s Relative TSR Ranking) is estimated on the grant date using the Monte-Carlo simulation valuation method which includes the following weighted-average assumptions.

Note 12: Segment Information 
  The Company conducts business globally and is managed on a geographic-service type basis consisting of   four   operating segments which are (i) North America Products, (ii) North America Services, (iii) International Products and (iv) International Services. These operating segments are also the Company's reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment and its reporting segments for financial reporting purposes. Revenues within our North America segments are primarily attributed to the United States while revenues within our International segments are attributed to countries in Europe, the Pacific Rim and Latin America.  
  The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those of the Company. The Company allocates resources to its operating segments and evaluates the performance of the operating segments based upon operating income. 
  The financial results for the Company's reporting segments are as follows:

Note 13: Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company is subject to unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws which require it to turn over to state governmental authorities the property of others held by the Company that has been unclaimed for specified periods of time. Property held by the Company subject to escheat laws primarily includes accounts payable, payroll checks and trade accounts receivable credits. The Company participated in voluntary disclosure programs in all 50 states within the United States and the District of Columbia in an effort to voluntarily comply with state abandoned property laws and settle past due unclaimed property obligations. The Company completed the programs and settled with 49 states and the District of Columbia which resulted in an immaterial charge to the consolidated financial statements during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. On May 22, 2013, the Company entered into Delaware s Voluntary Disclosure Agreement Program in order to voluntarily comply with Delaware s abandoned property law in exchange for certain protections and benefits. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2017, the Company has substantially completed Delaware's Voluntary Disclosure Program which resulted in an immaterial gain to the consolidated financial statements. 
  The Company is involved in, or has pending, various legal proceedings, claims, suits and complaints arising out of the normal course of business. Based on the facts currently available to the Company, Management believes these matters are adequately provided for, covered by insurance, without merit or not probable that an unfavorable material outcome will result. 
  There has been no other significant or unusual activity during Fiscal   2017  . 

Note 14: Restructuring 
    
  The Company has incurred and continues to incur costs related to facility consolidations, such as idle facility rent obligations and the write-off of leasehold improvements, and employee severance (collectively referred to as  restructuring expense ) in a continued effort to consolidate back office functions and to make its organization more efficient. These restructuring activities are compartmentalized and are not part of an overall plan and therefore the Company cannot estimate the total amount to be incurred in connection with the activity. Employee severance is generally payable within the next twelve months with certain facility costs extending through Fiscal 2019.     
    
  The following table summarizes the changes to the restructuring liability for the periods presented. 

Of the   $6,029   above,   $5,994   is classified as a current liability under Other liabilities on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets for the period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The following table summarizes restructuring expense, which is recorded in Selling, general   administrative expenses in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations, for the six months ended   September 30, 2016  , for the Company s reporting segments: 

As previously disclosed, Company management is considering initiatives to reset the business model and align costs with revenue to improve profitability.  As a result, during FY17, our profits could be negatively impacted by restructuring expenses resulting from such initiatives, some of which were incurred during 2Q17, which are designed to maximize the efficiency of the cost structure for each of our segments to enhance the Company's profitability. The Company believes there is a significant cost savings for such restructuring initiatives that will provide a return on investment in a relatively short period of time. Such restructuring initiatives have not been formalized and the Company cannot state with any certainty the timing or whether or not such events will occur.

  The Company 
  Black Box is a leading technology solutions provider dedicated to helping customers design, build, manage and secure their IT infrastructure. The Company offers Products and Services that it distributes through two platforms that it has built over its   40  -year history.  
  Under our Products platform ("Products"), we provide networking solutions through the sale of products for IT infrastructure, specialty networking, multimedia and KVM switching. 
  Our Products' revenues are generated from collaboration with key channel partners and system integrators, through a global distribution network and, to a lesser extent, sales to end-users. Products sells through a direct sales team as well as through its internet site and catalogs. These products are sold in a highly fragmented and competitive market. The Company has been in this business for over   40   years and has developed a reputation for being a reliable provider of high-quality communications and infrastructure products. With an average order size of less than one thousand dollars, Products revenues are less impacted by capital spending and more so by general information technology spending. 
    
  Our Services platform ("Services") is comprised of engineering and design, network operations centers, technical certifications, national and international sales teams, remote monitoring, on-site service teams and solutions practices. The primary services offered through this platform include communications lifecycle services, unified communications, structured cabling, video/AV services, in-building wireless and data center services. 
  The Company generates revenues in its Services business from the design, sale and/or installation of new communications and data infrastructure systems, the support of existing systems and MAC work. The Company's diverse portfolio of offerings allows it to service the needs of its clients independent of the technology that they choose, which it believes is a unique competitive advantage. For the sale and implementation of new communications systems, or other major projects, most significant orders are subject to competitive bidding processes and, generally, competition can be significant for such new orders. The Company is continually bidding on new projects to maintain and grow Services' revenues. Projects account for the majority of Services revenues and are primarily driven by the overall economic environment and information technology capital spending. The Company also serves government clients whose revenues are not as dependent on the overall economic environment as commercial clients but are subject to governmental budgetary constraints. 
    
  New communications systems orders often generate post-implementation maintenance via a fixed fee model where revenues are earned ratably over the term of the agreement (generally 1-3 years for commercial clients and 3-5 years for government clients) or a variable fee model that is based on time and materials per occurrence, similar to MAC work. Maintenance revenues generally are not dependent on the economy as clients contract for maintenance to extend the life of their existing equipment and delay capital spending on new communications systems. Maintenance and MAC work revenues are also dependent upon the Company's relationship with its clients and its long track record of providing high-quality service. 
    
  The Company's Services business generates backlog which is defined by the Company as orders and contracts considered to be firm. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's total backlog, which relates primarily to Services, was   $342,555  , of which   $255,295     is expected to be completed within the next twelve months.

Our platforms introduce scale, flexibility and leverage to the business, and provide the following competitive advantages: 

A diversified client base:   We have built a diversified client base that ranges from small organizations to many of the world's largest corporations and institutions. Black Box clients participate in many industries, including government, technology, business services, healthcare, manufacturing, banking and retail, among others. Revenues from our clients are segmented with approximately 60% from large companies (  i.e.  , revenues greater than $1 billion, including federal governments), approximately 20% from medium-sized companies (  i.e.  , revenues between $50 million and $1 billion, including state governments) and approximately 20% from small companies (  i.e.  , revenues less than $50 million, including local governments). We strive to develop extensive and long-term relationships with high-quality clients as we believe that satisfied clients will demand quality services and product offerings even in economic downturns. Also, we believe that our distinctive portfolio of products and services will allow us to leverage the relationships and introduce additional offerings to satisfied clients. 

Key relationships with leading technology partners:    We have built long-term relationships with all major communications equipment manufacturers and we are a top partner with the market leaders. 

Broad geographic footprint:   We have built a global footprint with offices throughout the world. 

Deep organic resources:   We have   3,434   team members world-wide, with the collective experience and certifications to serve our clients with on-site and remote capabilities. 

Dedicated sales force:   We have a team of direct sales people world-wide. 

Strong financial position:   We have a strong balance sheet and have generated positive cash flow for   40   consecutive years. 
       
  The Company services a variety of clients within most major industries, with the highest concentration in the government, business services, manufacturing, banking, retail, healthcare and technology industry verticals. Factors that impact those verticals, therefore, could have an impact on the Company. While the Company generates most of its revenues in North America, the Company also generates revenues from around the world, primarily Europe, such that factors that impact European markets could impact the Company. Management strives to develop extensive and long-term relationships with high-quality clients as Management believes that satisfied clients will demand quality services and product offerings from us even in economic downturns. 
  2QYTD17   vs   2QYTD16   Summary 

n/m = not meaningful 
  Diluted   loss   per share was   $0.44  , compared to   $8.41     in the same period last year as a result of: 
             
    a   $28,823     decrease   in Revenues as a result of a decrease in Service Revenues, primarily due to a decrease in our core commercial revenues in North America Services as a result of a delay in a major project and a less than normal focus on sales as a result of multiple transformational activities including but not limited to a commercial sales organization realignment and an ERP consolidation project and a decrease in Products Revenues due to a decrease in North America Products as a result of lower volumes of large orders, a change in sales leadership and lower demand for legacy data networking products along with relatively consistent government revenues within North America Services after nearly four fiscal years of revenue declines, 
                
    a   $18,960     decrease   in Gross profit as a result of the decrease in Revenues in North America Services and North America Products noted above and a decrease in Gross profit margin which included $9,137 of Inventory impairment loss due to a write-down to lower of cost or market as a result of specific legacy networking product discontinuation and excess inventory given the current demand outlook for North America Products, and due to a write-down to lower of cost or market as a result of excess inventory given current demand in commercial services within North America Services,

a   $3,653     decrease   in Selling, general and administrative expenses which was primarily the result of a $1,175 gain on the sale of a facility and a decrease in investments for the operations transformation and infrastructure, lower operating costs due to cost reduction initiatives and cost savings from restructuring during the first nine-months of Fiscal 2016, partially offset by additional costs related to variable compensation programs, $1,514 of additional restructuring and $571 of additional depreciation. As expected, the Company did not receive any benefit during the first half of Fiscal 2017 for restructuring activities initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016. The Company does expect to realize benefits during the remainder of Fiscal 2017 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, 
                 
    a   $178     decrease   in Interest expense (income) resulting from a decrease in weighted-average outstanding debt partially offset by an increase in the weighted-average interest rate, 
                
    a   $20,246     increase   in Provision for income taxes and a decrease in the effective rate from   13.1%   to   (14.0)%   due to mix of income across various taxing jurisdictions. 
                
    a   257     decrease   in Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding resulting from the Company's common stock repurchases partially offset by the vesting of certain restricted stock awards in 1Q17. 
     Net cash provided by operating activities was   $15,682  , which included Net loss of   $6,581   and   negative   cash from working capital of   $1,661  , compared to net cash used for operating activities of   $13,920  , which included Net loss of   $129,091   and   negative   cash from working capital of   $31,565  , in the same period last year.

2Q17   vs   2Q16 
  Total Revenues were   $218,749  , a   decrease   of   8%   from   $236,838   in the same period last year. Product Revenues were   $42,263  , a   decrease   of   5%   from   $44,284   in the same period last year primarily due to a decrease in North America Products as a result of lower volumes of large orders, a change in sales leadership and lower demand for legacy data networking products, partially offset by an increase in International Products due to fulfillment of a large solution order. Service Revenues were   $176,486  , a   decrease   of   8%   from   $192,554   in the same period last year primarily due to a decrease in core commercial revenues in North America Services as a result of a delay in a major project and a less than normal focus on sales as a result of multiple transformational activities including but not limited to a commercial sales organization realignment and an ERP consolidation project partially offset by an increase in government revenues as a result of certain projects timeline acceleration and product only sales activity.  During 2Q17, the Company realigned the commercial sales team to a vertical market view which was not a significant realignment compared to the sales transformation in Fiscal 2015.  As a result of this realignment the Company is strengthening its commitment to clients and strategic partners to create business outcomes required by their specific markets and by doing so will support deeper, more strategic thinking about our offerings, enabling solution and outcome based selling to that market and differentiating the Company in the marketplace.  We do not expect to see significant benefits from this sales realignment due to the 12-18 month sales cycle for these solutions. 
  Total Gross profit margin was   24.9%  , a   decrease   of   17%   from   30.1%   in the same period last year. Product Gross profit margin was   35.6%  , which included $2,810 of Inventory impairment loss due to a write-down to lower of cost or market as a result of specific legacy networking product discontinuation and excess inventory given the current demand outlook for North America Products, a   decrease   of   16%   from   42.4%   in the same period last year. Service Gross profit margin was   22.3%  , which included $6,327 of Inventory impairment loss due to a write-down to lower of cost or market as a result of excess inventory given current demand in commercial services within North America Services, a   decrease   of   18%   from   27.3%   in the same period last year. The Company is focused on maximizing asset utilization and working capital efficiencies and these reductions will increase cost efficiency in future periods.  Based on the demand reviews completed, resulting in the stated inventory impairment loss, the Company does not expect further inventory impairments during Fiscal 2017.  
  Total Operating loss margin was   3.0%  , compared to   63.3%   in the same period last year. Product Operating loss margin was   1.6%  , compared to   63.2%   in the same period last year, primarily due to a decrease in goodwill impairment loss of   $30,559   (  $25,211   in North America Products and   $5,348   in International Products), partially offset by lower Gross profit margin in North America Products as described above. Service Operating loss margin was   3.3%  , compared to   63.3%   in the same period last year, primarily due to a decrease in goodwill and intangible asset impairment loss of   $126,713   (  $119,547   in North America Services and   $7,166   in International Services), cost savings from restructuring during the first nine-months of Fiscal 2016 and cost control programs that were implemented during Fiscal 2017, partially offset by lower Gross profit margin in North America Services as described above. During 2Q17 the Company incurred restructuring charges in an effort to reduce investments in slow growth markets which will allow for future investments in expanding markets. As expected, the Company did not receive any benefit during 2Q17 for restructuring activities initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016. The Company does expect to realize benefits during the remainder of Fiscal 2017 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. 
    
  2QYTD17   vs   2QYTD16    
  Total Revenues were   $437,229  , a   decrease   of   6%   from   $466,052   in the same period last year. Product Revenues were   $82,144  , a   decrease   of   3%   from   $84,780   in the same period last year, primarily due to a decrease in North America Products as a result of lower volumes of large orders, a change in sales leadership and lower demand for legacy data networking products, partially offset by an increase in International Products due to fulfillment of a large solution order.     Service Revenues were   $355,085  , a   decrease   of   7%   from   $381,272   in the same period last year primarily due to a decrease in core commercial revenues, primarily in the business services industry, in North America Services as a result of a delay in a major project and a less than normal focus on sales as a result of multiple transformational activities including but not limited to a commercial sales organization realignment and an ERP consolidation project along with relatively consistent government revenues after nearly four fiscal years of revenue declines. 
  Total Gross profit margin was   27.9%  , a   decrease   of   8%   from   30.3%   in the same period last year. Product Gross profit margin was   39.0%  , which included $2,810 of Inventory impairment loss, a   decrease   of   7%   from   42.0%   in the same period last year. Service Gross profit margin was   25.4%  , which included $6,327 of Inventory impairment loss, a   decrease   of   8%   from   27.7%   in the same period last year. 
  Total Operating loss margin was   0.9%  , an   increase   compared to   31.3%   in the same period last year. Product Operating profit margin was   0.7%  , an increase compared to Product Operating loss margin of   31.5%   in the same period last year, primarily due to a decrease in goodwill impairment loss of   $30,559   (  $25,211   in North America Products and   $5,348   in International Products), partially offset by lower Gross profit margin in North America Products as described above and an increase in Selling, general

and administrative expenses due to costs related to variable compensation programs. Service Operating loss margin was   1.2%  , an increase compared to   31.2%   in the same period last year, primarily due to a decrease in goodwill and intangible asset impairment loss of   $126,713   (  $119,547   in North America Services and   $7,166   in International Services), cost savings from restructuring during the first nine-months of Fiscal 2016 and cost control programs that were implemented during Fiscal 2017,     partially offset by lower Gross profit margin in North America Services as described above and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses due to costs related to variable compensation programs. 
  As previously disclosed, Company management is considering initiatives to reset the business model and align costs with revenue to improve profitability.  As a result, during FY17, our profits could be negatively impacted by restructuring expenses resulting from such initiatives, some of which were incurred in 2Q17, which are designed to maximize the efficiency of the cost structure for each of our segments to enhance the Company's profitability. The Company believes there is a significant cost savings for such restructuring initiatives that will provide a return on investment in a relatively short period of time. However, there can be no assurance that we would realize adequate returns on this investment nor that we would be able to maintain such cost savings in the future. Such restructuring initiatives have not been formalized and the Company cannot state with any certainty the timing or whether or not such events will occur.  
    
  Interest expense, net and Income Taxes 

2Q17   vs   2Q16 
  Interest expense was   $1,050  , consistent with   $1,053     in the same period last year primarily as a result of lower interest due to lower average debt offset by higher interest rate. Interest expense as a percent of Revenues was   0.5%  , compared to   0.4%   in the same period last year. The weighted-average outstanding debt and weighted-average interest rate was   $131,973   and   2.6%  , respectively, compared to   $172,037   and   1.9%   in the same period last year. 
  Benefit from income taxes was   $1,524  , a decrease of   93%   from   $21,512   in the same period last year. The effective income tax rate was   20.0%  , an   increase   of   41%   from   14.2%   in the same period last year. The effective income tax rate   increase   from   14.2%   to   20.0%   was primarily due to due to the deferred tax write-off of equity awards. 
  2QYTD17   vs   2QYTD16 
  Interest expense was   $2,257  , a   decrease   of   7%   from   $2,435   in the same period last year primarily as a result of lower interest due to lower average debt offset by higher interest rate and a change in the fair value of the interest-rate swap of $399 (from a gain of   $399   in   2QYTD16   to a gain of   $0   in   2QYTD17  ). Interest expense as a percent of Revenues was   0.5%  , consistent with   0.5%   in the same period last year. The weighted-average outstanding debt and weighted-average interest rate was   $132,643   and   2.5%  , respectively, compared to   $166,494   and   1.9%   in the same period last year. 
  Provision for income taxes was   $808  , compared to a benefit from income taxes of   $19,438   in the same period last year. The effective income tax rate was   (14.0)%  , a decrease compared to the effective income tax rate of   13.1%   in the same period last year. The effective income tax rate decrease from   13.1%   to   (14.0)%   was primarily due to due to mix of income across various taxing jurisdictions. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Overview 
  A majority of our revenue is generated through individual sales of products and services. Less than 20% of our revenue is generated from long-term support contracts. We depend on repeat client business, as well as our ability to develop new client business, to sustain and grow our revenue. Most significant orders are subject to a competitive bidding process and, generally, competition can be significant for such new orders. Our business model provides us with flexibility in terms of capital expenditures and other required operating expenses. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to generate net cash provided by operating activities that exceeds our capital expenditures and other required operating expenses and will be available for discretionary investments. 
  We seek to allocate company resources in a manner that will enhance per share results. Our discretionary investments include: investments in growth programs and infrastructure, strategic acquisitions of high quality growth-oriented companies, a return to our stockholders through dividends and common stock repurchases and repaying our debt.

     Table of Contents  

Liquidity Position 
  The following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position. 

The Company's reported cash balance is at its lowest level since March 31, 2006 due to more efficient usage of international cash balances. We will continue to evaluate additional alternatives to reduce the amount of cash on our balance sheet but we are limited by a combination of factors such as protected currencies, adverse tax impacts and other operating needs or requirements. The Company's reported working capital is at its lowest level since July 1, 2006 due to an increased focus around a reduction of working capital, including a reduction of safety stock levels and an updated evaluation of on hand inventory levels based on expected demand designed to make our working capital structure more efficient.  The Company's reported long-term debt is at its lowest level since March 31, 2006 due to the results of reduced working capital and cash efficiencies discussed above and a priority placed on debt reduction. 
    
  We expect that our cash, the available unused commitments of the Credit Agreement (hereinafter defined), which are lower than the unused commitments due to a financial covenant, and net cash provided by operating activities should be sufficient to cover the Company's working capital requirements, capital expenditures, dividend program, potential stock repurchases, potential future acquisitions or strategic investments and other cash needs for at least the next 12 months. 
    
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash. 

Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $15,682  , due primarily to Net loss of   $6,581  , inclusive of non-cash charges, cash inflows of   $6,824   and   $4,866   from Inventory and Accounts payable, respectively, partially offset by cash outflows of   $7,607   and   $5,108   from Accounts receivable and Costs in excess of billings, respectively, compared to net cash used for operating activities of   $13,920   in the same period last year, due primarily to Net loss of $129,091, inclusive of non-cash charges, a cash outflow of $28,688, $14,403 and $6,227 from Accounts receivable, Accounts Payable and All other liabilities, respectively, partially offset by cash inflows of $11,380 and $3,849 from All other assets and Inventories, respectively. Changes in the above accounts are based on average Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 exchange rates, as applicable. 
  Changes in working capital, and particularly changes in Accounts receivable, Costs in excess of billings and Billings in excess of cost, can have a significant impact on net cash provided by operating activities, largely due to the timing of payments and receipts.  
  Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities 
  Capital expenditures 
  The Company made investments of   $3,875   compared to   $4,498   in the same period last year which primarily related to information technology infrastructure, computer hardware and software and vehicles.

Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities 
  Long-term debt 
  Repayment of long-term debt was   $17,922   compared to proceeds from long-term debt of   $13,918   in the same period last year, which was used to fund common stock repurchases and operations. 
  Common stock repurchases 
  The Company made discretionary investments in the form of common stock repurchases of   $0   compared to   $2,000   in the same period last year. The Company also made tax payments of   $477   compared to   $796   in the prior year related to share withholding to satisfy employee income taxes due as a result of the vesting of certain restricted stock units.  
  Since the inception of the repurchase program beginning in April 1999 through   September 30, 2016  , the Company has repurchased   11,194,933   shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $406,661  , or an average purchase price per share of   $36.33  . These shares do not include the treasury shares withheld for tax payments due upon the vesting of certain restricted stock units and performance shares. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   1,305,067   shares were available under the most recent repurchase programs. Additional repurchases of common stock may occur from time to time depending upon factors such as the Company s cash flows and general market conditions. There can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of such repurchases. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is permitted to repurchase its common stock as long as no Event of Default or Potential Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall have occurred and is continuing or shall occur as a result thereof. In addition, no repurchase of common stock is permitted, with certain exceptions, under the Credit Agreement if the Company's consolidated leverage ratio (based on EBITDA) exceeds   3.00  .     At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's leverage ratio was   2.79  . 
  Dividends 
  The Company made discretionary investments in the form of dividends to its stockholders of   $3,465   compared to   $3,229   in the prior year. While the Company expects to continue to declare quarterly dividends, the payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") and the timing and amount of any future dividends will depend upon earnings, cash requirements and the financial condition of the Company. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is permitted to make regular quarterly dividends not exceeding   $15,000   per year as long as no Event of Default or Potential Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall have occurred and is continuing or shall occur as a result thereof. In addition, the Company is permitted to make other distributions or dividends if such event would not violate a 3.00 to 1.00 consolidated leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement. 
  Credit Agreement 
  On May 9, 2016, the Company refinanced its then existing $200,000 credit facility pursuant to a new credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and certain other lender parties. The Credit Agreement expires on May 9, 2021.  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are permitted up to a maximum amount of   $200,000  , and includes up to   $15,000   of swing-line loans and   $25,000   of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement may be increased by the Company up to an additional   $50,000   and may be unilaterally and permanently reduced by the Company to not less than the then outstanding amount of all borrowings. Interest on outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement accrues, at the Company s option, at a rate based on either: (a) a Base Rate Option equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds open rate, plus fifty (50) basis points (  0.5%  ), (ii) the bank s prime rate, and (iii) the daily LIBOR rate, plus 100 basis points (  1.0%  ), in each case plus   0%   to   1.00%   (determined by a leverage ratio based on the Company s consolidated EBITDA) or (b) a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus   1.00%   to   2.00%   (determined by a leverage ratio based on the Company s consolidated EBITDA). The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain compliance with certain non-financial and financial covenants such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. The Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company s material direct and indirect subsidiaries that are incorporated (or organized) under the laws of the District of Columbia or under the laws of any state or commonwealth of the United States and are guaranteed by such domestic subsidiaries.

Inflation 
  The overall effects of inflation on the Company have been nominal. Although long-term inflation rates are difficult to predict, the Company continues to strive to minimize the effect of inflation through improved productivity and cost reduction programs as well as price adjustments within the constraints of market competition. 
  Contingencies 
  The Company is subject to unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws which require it to turn over to state governmental authorities the property of others held by the Company that has been unclaimed for specified periods of time. Property held by the Company subject to escheat laws primarily includes accounts payable, payroll checks and trade accounts receivable credits. The Company participated in voluntary disclosure programs in all 50 states within the United States and the District of Columbia in an effort to voluntarily comply with state abandoned property laws and settle past due unclaimed property obligations. The Company completed the programs and settled with 49 states and the District of Columbia which resulted in an immaterial charge to the consolidated financial statements during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. On May 22, 2013, the Company entered into Delaware s Voluntary Disclosure Agreement Program in order to voluntarily comply with Delaware s abandoned property law in exchange for certain protections and benefits.  During the second quarter of Fiscal 2017, the Company substantially completed Delaware's Voluntary Disclosure Program which resulted in an immaterial gain to the consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies/Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The Company s critical accounting policies require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and are the most important to the portrayal of the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company s critical accounting policies are disclosed in Part II, Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of the Form 10-K. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements within the Form 10-K. No additional significant accounting policies have been adopted during Fiscal   2017  . 
  Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  There have been no accounting pronouncements adopted during Fiscal   2017   that have had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
  Cautionary Forward Looking Statements 
  Any forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or in documents incorporated herein by reference are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact that they use words such as "should," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate," "expect," "target," "may," "will," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors, they may include levels of business activity and operating expenses, expenses relating to corporate compliance requirements, cash flows, global economic and business conditions, the timing, costs, and benefits of restructuring programs and other initiatives, successful marketing of the Company's product and services offerings, successful implementation of the Company's integration initiatives, successful implementation of the Company's government contracting programs, competition, changes in foreign, political and economic conditions, fluctuating foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar, rapid changes in technologies, client preferences, the Company's arrangements with suppliers of voice equipment and technology, government budgetary constraints and various other matters, many of which are beyond the Company's control. Additional risk factors are included in the Form 10-K and our previously filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for Fiscal 2017. We can give no assurance that any goal, plan or target set forth in forward-looking statements will be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of future events or developments and caution you not to unduly rely on any such forward-looking statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  The Company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business that include interest-rate volatility and foreign currency exchange rates volatility. Market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings, cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year. The Company does not hold or issue any other financial derivative instruments (other than those specifically noted below) nor does it engage in speculative trading of financial derivatives. 
  Interest-rate Risk 
  The Company s primary interest-rate risk relates to its long-term debt obligations under the Credit Agreement which was   $101,400   as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in the interest rate of the variable rate debt would reduce the Company s earnings in the subsequent fiscal quarter by   $257   (  $158   net of tax) assuming the Company employed no intervention strategies. 
  Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
  The Company has operations, clients and suppliers worldwide, thereby exposing the Company s financial results to foreign currency fluctuations. In an effort to reduce this risk of foreign currency fluctuations, the Company generally sells and purchases inventory based on prices denominated in U.S. dollars. Intercompany sales to subsidiaries are generally denominated in the subsidiaries  local currency. The Company has entered and will continue in the future, on a selective basis, to enter into foreign currency contracts to reduce the foreign currency exposure related to certain intercompany transactions, primarily trade receivables and loans. All of the foreign currency contracts have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of any changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI") until the hedged forecasted transaction occurs or the recognized currency transaction affects earnings. Once the forecasted transaction occurs or the recognized currency transaction affects earnings, the effective portion of any related gains or losses on the cash flow hedge is reclassified from AOCI to the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the event it becomes probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the ineffective portion of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge would be reclassified from AOCI to the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had open foreign currency contracts in Australian and Canadian dollars, Danish krone, Euros, Mexican pesos, Norwegian kroner, British pounds sterling, Swedish krona, Swiss francs and Japanese yen. The open contracts have contract rates ranging from   1.30   to   1.39   Australian dollar,   1.29   to   1.36   Canadian dollar,   6.48   to   6.66   Danish krone,   0.87   to   0.90   Euro,   18.65   to   18.75   Mexican peso,   8.09   to   8.87   Norwegian kroner,   0.69   to   0.77   British pound sterling,   8.01   to   8.66   Swedish krona,   0.97   to   0.99   Swiss franc and   100.01   to   109.30   Japanese yen, all per U.S. dollar. The total open contracts had a notional amount of   $53,849   and will expire within   eight   months. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
  Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   October 1, 2016  . Based upon this assessment, Management has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   October 1, 2016   to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to Management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules  13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

27 

     Table of Contents  

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of its inherent limitations, the Company s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

           2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4.

           a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b.

           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
