thereunder, the  Investment Company Act ), the Company would be deemed to  control  a portfolio company if the Company owned more than 25% of its outstanding voting securities
and/or held the power to exercise control over the management or policies of the portfolio company. As of September 30, 2016, the Company does not  control  any of these portfolio companies. Under the Investment Company Act, the Company
would be deemed an  affiliated person  of a portfolio company if the Company owns 5% or more of the portfolio company s outstanding voting securities. As of September 30, 2016, the Company is not an  affiliated person  of
any of these portfolio companies.    

(2) 
 Variable rate loans to the portfolio companies and variable rate notes of structured finance obligations bear interest at a rate that may be determined by reference to either LIBOR or an alternate base rate (commonly
based on the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate), which generally resets quarterly. For each such loan and note, the Company has provided the interest rate in effect as of September 30, 2016.    

(3) 
 Loan includes interest rate floor feature.    

(4) 
 Denotes that all or a portion of the assets are owned by the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Carlyle GMS Finance SPV LLC (the  Borrower Sub ). The Borrower Sub has entered into a senior secured
revolving credit facility (as amended, the  Revolving Credit Facility ). The lenders of the Revolving Credit Facility have a first lien security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Borrower Sub (see Note 6, Borrowings).
Accordingly, such assets are not available to creditors of the Company or Carlyle GMS Finance MM CLO 2015-1 LLC (the  2015-1 Issuer ), a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary of the Company.    

(5) 
 Denotes that all or a portion of the assets are owned by the Company. The Company has entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the  Facility ). The lenders of the Facility have a
first lien security interest in substantially all of the portfolio investments held by the Company (see Note 6, Borrowings). Accordingly, such assets are not available to creditors of the Borrower Sub or the 2015-1 Issuer.    

(6) 
 Amortized cost represents original cost, including origination fees, adjusted for the accretion/amortization of discounts/premiums, as applicable, on debt investments using the effective interest method. Equity tranche
collateralized loan obligation ( CLO ) fund investments, which are referred to as  structured finance obligations , are recorded at amortized cost using the effective interest method.    

(7) 
 Fair value is determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of Directors of the Company (see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Fair Value Measurements), pursuant to the
Company s valuation policy.    

(8) 
 The Company has determined the indicated investments are non-qualifying assets under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. Under the Investment Company Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying
assets unless, at the time such acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company s total assets.

 The Company receives less than the stated interest rate of this loan as a result of an agreement among lenders. The interest rate reduction is 2.75% on Ministry Brands, LLC. Pursuant to the agreement among lenders in
respect of this loan, this investment represents a first lien/first out loan, which has first priority ahead of the first lien/last out loan with respect to principal, interest and other payments.    

(11) 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company has a greater than 25% but less than 50% equity or subordinated notes ownership interest in certain structured finance obligations. These investments have governing documents
that preclude the Company from controlling management of the entity and therefore the Company has determined that the issuer of the investment is not a controlled affiliate or a non-controlled affiliate because the investments are not  voting
securities .    

(12) 
 In addition to the interest earned based on the stated interest rate of this loan, which is the amount reflected in this schedule, the Company is entitled to receive additional interest as a result of an agreement among
lenders as follows: Dimensional Dental Management, LLC (4.60%), EIP Merger Sub, LLC (Evolve IP) (3.82%), International Medical Group, Inc. (4.65%), Ministry Brands, LLC (2.75%), Product Quest Manufacturing, LLC (3.55%), PSI Services LLC (4.27%),

with respect to principal, interest and other payments.

   CARLYLE GMS FINANCE, INC.   
    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)   
  As of September 30, 2016      (dollar amounts in thousands,
except per share data)      1. ORGANIZATION   
 Carlyle GMS Finance, Inc. ( GMS Finance  or the  Company ) is a Maryland corporation formed on February 8, 2012, and
structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company. GMS Finance has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the  Investment Company Act ). GMS Finance has elected to be treated, and intends to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company
( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ).    GMS Finance s
investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments in U.S. middle market companies, which the Company defines as companies with approximately $10 million to $100 million of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ). GMS Finance seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans; first lien/last out
loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind first lien/first out loans;  unitranche  loans, which are loans that combine features of first lien, second lien or subordinated loans, generally in a first lien position; and
secured corporate bonds with features similar to the features of these categories of first lien loans) and second lien senior secured loans (which may include senior secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary
priority behind first lien loans) (collectively,  Middle Market Senior Loans ). The Middle Market Senior Loans are generally made to private U.S. middle market companies that are, in many cases, controlled by private equity firms.
Depending on market conditions, GMS Finance expects that between 70% and 80% of the value of its assets will be invested in Middle Market Senior Loans, with the balance invested in higher-yielding investments, which may include middle market junior
loans such as corporate mezzanine loans, equity co-investments, broadly syndicated first lien and second lien senior secured loans, high-yield bonds, structured finance obligations and/or other opportunistic investments. GMS Finance expects that the
composition of its portfolio will change over time given Carlyle GMS Investment Management L.L.C. s (the  Investment Adviser ) view on, among other things, the economic and credit environment (including with respect to interest rates)
in which the Company is operating.    On May 2, 2013, GMS Finance completed its initial closing of capital commitments (the  Initial
Closing ) and subsequently commenced substantial investment operations. If GMS Finance has not consummated an initial public offering of its common stock that results in an unaffiliated public float of at least 15% of the aggregate capital
commitments received prior to the date of such initial public offering (a  Qualified IPO ) by May 2, 2018, then GMS Finance (subject to any necessary stockholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act) will use
its best efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve.    GMS Finance is an  emerging growth company  as defined in the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. GMS Finance will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years following an initial public offering, although if the market value of the common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700
million as of any June 30 before that time, GMS Finance would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31.  
 GMS Finance is externally managed by the Investment Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended. Carlyle GMS Finance Administration L.L.C. (the  Administrator ) provides the administrative services necessary for GMS Finance to operate. Both the Investment Adviser and the Administrator are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Carlyle
Investment Management L.L.C., a subsidiary of The Carlyle Group L.P.  Carlyle  refers to The Carlyle Group L.P., its affiliates and its  
      22

consolidated subsidiaries, a global alternative asset manager publicly traded on NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol  CG . Refer to the sec.gov website for further information
on Carlyle.    Carlyle GMS Finance SPV LLC (the  Borrower Sub ) is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on
January 3, 2013. The Borrower Sub invests in first and second lien senior secured loans. The Borrower Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is consolidated in these consolidated financial statements commencing from the date of its
formation, January 3, 2013.    On June 26, 2015, the Company completed a $400 million term debt securitization (the  2015-1 Debt
Securitization ). The notes offered in the 2015-1 Debt Securitization (the  2015-1 Notes ) were issued by Carlyle GMS Finance MM CLO 2015-1 LLC (the  2015-1 Issuer ), a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary of the
Company, and are secured by a diversified portfolio of the 2015-1 Issuer consisting primarily of first and second lien senior secured loans. Refer to Note 7 for details. The 2015-1 Issuer is consolidated in these consolidated financial statements
commencing from the date of its formation, May 8, 2015.    On February 29, 2016, the Company and Credit Partners USA LLC ( Credit
Partners ) entered into an amended and restated limited liability company agreement (as amended, the  Limited Liability Company Agreement ) to co-manage Middle Market Credit Fund, LLC ( Credit Fund ). Credit Fund primarily
invests in first lien loans of middle-market companies. Credit Fund is managed by a six-member board of managers, on which the Company and Credit Partners each have equal representation. The Company and Credit Partners each have 50% economic
ownership of Credit Fund and have commitments to fund, from time to time, capital of up to $400,000 each. Refer to Note 5, Middle Market Credit Fund, LLC, for details.  
 As a BDC, GMS Finance is required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. As part of these requirements, the Company must not acquire
any assets other than  qualifying assets  specified in the Investment Company Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of its total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions).  
 GMS Finance has elected to be treated, and intends to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code,
and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, GMS Finance must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its
stockholders generally at least 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Pursuant to this election, GMS Finance generally does not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income that it distributes to
stockholders, provided that GMS Finance satisfies those requirements.     2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
   Basis of Presentation      The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ). The Company is an investment company for the purposes of
accounting and financial reporting in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2013-08, Financial Services Investment Companies ( ASU 2013-08 ):  Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and Disclosure
Requirements . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of GMS Finance and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Borrower Sub and the 2015-1 Issuer. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
US GAAP for an investment company requires investments to be recorded at fair value. The carrying value for all other assets and liabilities approximates their fair value.  
 The interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the
requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Articles 6 and 10 of Regulation  S-X.  Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in
 
      23  

Table of Contents  

accordance with US GAAP are omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for the fair presentation of consolidated financial statements for the interim period
presented have been included. These adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. This Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations
for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year.  
   Use of Estimates      The preparation
of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management s estimates are based on historical experiences and other factors, including expectations of future events that management
believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the process of applying the Company s accounting policies. Assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of investments and their
resulting impact on base management and incentive fees involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and these assumptions and estimates may be significant to the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these
estimates and such differences could be material.      Investments    
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from
the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments charged off during the period,
net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments as presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations reflects the net change in the fair value of investments, including the reversal of
previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. See Note 3 for further information about fair value measurements.  
   Cash and Cash Equivalents      Cash
and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and highly liquid investments (e.g., money market funds, U.S. treasury notes) with original maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair
value. The Company s cash and cash equivalents are held with two large financial institutions and cash held in such financial institutions may, at times, exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit.  
   Revenue Recognition       Interest from Investments
and Realized Gain/Loss on Investments     Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts and
amortization of premiums. Discounts from and premiums to par value on debt investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. The amortized cost of debt
investments represents the original cost, including origination fees, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, if any. At time of exit, the realized gain or loss on an investment is the difference between the amortized
cost at time of exit and the cash received at exit using the specific identification method.    The Company may have loans in its portfolio
that contain payment-in-kind ( PIK ) provisions. PIK represents interest that is accrued and recorded as interest income at the contractual rates, increases the loan  
      24

principal on the respective capitalization dates, and is generally due at maturity. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three month and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, no loans in the portfolio contained PIK provisions.    Interest income from investments in the
 equity  class of collateralized loan obligation ( CLO ) funds, which are included in  structured finance obligations , is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed
cash flows in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 325-40,  Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financials Assets . We monitor the expected cash inflows from our CLO equity investments, including the expected
residual payments and the effective yield is determined and updated at least quarterly. In estimating these cash flows, there are a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties, including the amount and timing of principal payments which
are impacted by prepayments, repurchases, defaults, delinquencies and liquidations of or within the CLO funds. These uncertainties are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that could have impacted the Company s estimates if the
information was known at the time. As a result, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.     Other Income   
 Other income may include income such as consent, waiver, amendment, and syndication fees associated with the Company s investment
activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered by the Company to portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered. The Company may receive fees for guaranteeing the
outstanding debt of a portfolio company. Such fees will be amortized into other income over the life of the guarantee. The unamortized amount, if any, is included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.
For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company earned $1,909 and $4,578, respectively, in other income. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the Company earned $196 and $669,
respectively, in other income.     Non-Accrual Income   
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable
doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to
principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current.
Management may not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three month and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, no loans in the portfolio were on non-accrual status.      Revolving Credit Facility, Facility and 2015-1 Notes Related Costs,
Expenses and Deferred Financing Costs (See Note 6, Borrowings, and Note 7, 2015-1 Notes)      Interest expense and unused commitment
fees on the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility are recorded on an accrual basis. Unused commitment fees are included in credit facility fees in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
 The Revolving Credit Facility and Facility are recorded at carrying value, which approximates fair value.  
 Deferred financing costs include capitalized expenses related to the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility. Amortization of
deferred financing costs for each credit facility is computed on the straight-line basis over the respective term of each credit facility, except for a portion that was accelerated in connection with the amendment of the Revolving Credit Facility as
described in Note 6. The amortization of such costs is included in credit facility fees in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
      25  

Table of Contents  

  Deferred financing costs also include capitalized expenses including structuring and arrangement
fees related to the offering of the 2015-1 Notes. These costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the 2015-1 Notes. Amortization of deferred financing costs for the 2015-1 Notes is computed on the effective yield method
over the term of the 2015-1 Notes. The amortization of such costs is included in interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
 The 2015-1 Notes are recorded at carrying value, which approximates fair value.  
   Organization and Offering Costs    
 The Company agreed to reimburse the Investment Adviser for initial organization and offering costs incurred on behalf of GMS Finance up to
$1,500. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $1,500 of organization and offering costs had been incurred by GMS Finance and $57 of excess organization and offering costs had been incurred by the Investment Adviser since inception.
The $1,500 of incurred organization and offering costs are allocated to all stockholders based on their respective capital commitment and are re-allocated amongst all stockholders at the time of each capital drawdown subsequent to the Initial
Closing. The Company s organization costs incurred are expensed and the offering costs are charged against equity when incurred.      Income Taxes
     For federal income tax purposes, GMS Finance has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code, and intends to make the required
distributions to its stockholders as specified therein. In order to qualify as a RIC, GMS Finance must meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. If such requirements are met, then GMS Finance is
generally required to pay income taxes only on the portion of its taxable income and gains it does not distribute.    The minimum
distribution requirements applicable to RICs require GMS Finance to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income ( ICTI ), as defined by the Code, each year. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in
a tax year, GMS Finance may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year. Any such carryover ICTI must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the
final tax return related to the year which generated such ICTI.    In addition, based on the excise distribution requirements, GMS Finance
is subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed income unless GMS Finance distributes in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of its ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of
capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income
or capital gain net income retained by GMS Finance that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. GMS Finance intends to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the excise distribution
requirements.    The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its consolidated financial
statements to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely than not  to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes, if any, are included in income tax expense.  
 The Borrower Sub and the 2015-1 Issuer are disregarded entities for tax purposes and are consolidated with the tax return of GMS Finance.  
   Capital Calls and Dividends and Distributions to Common Stockholders    
 The Company records the shares issued in connection with capital calls as of the effective date of the capital call. To the extent that the
Company has taxable income available, the Company intends to make quarterly  
      26  

Table of Contents  

distributions to its common stockholders. Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount to be distributed is determined by the Board of Directors
each quarter and is generally based upon the taxable earnings estimated by management and available cash. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed at least annually, although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains
for investment.    The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any distributions on behalf of its
stockholders, for those who have elected to participate in the plan. As a result of adopting such a plan, if the Board of Directors authorizes, and GMS Finance declares, a cash dividend or distribution, the stockholders who have elected to
participate in the dividend reinvestment plan would have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock, rather than receiving cash. Prior to a Qualified IPO, the Company
intends to use primarily newly issued shares of its common stock to implement the plan issued at the net asset value per share most recently determined by the Board of Directors. After a Qualified IPO, the Company intends to use primarily newly
issued shares to implement the plan so long as the market value per share is equal to or greater than the net asset value per share as of the close of business on the relevant payment date for such dividend or distribution. If the market value per
share is less than the net asset value per share as of the close of business on the relevant payment date, the plan administrator would purchase the common stock on behalf of participants in the open market, unless the Company instructs the plan
administrator otherwise.      Functional Currency    
 The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. Dollar and all transactions were in U.S. Dollars.  
   Recent Accounting Standards Updates    
 On April 7, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2015-3,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-3 ). ASU 2015-3 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts and premiums. This guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and the ASU requires the guidance to be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company adopted this guidance on January
1, 2016 and reclassified $2,356 of debt issuance costs from deferred financing costs to 2015-1 Notes payable in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2015.  
 In May 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2015-7,  Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Disclosures for
Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)  ( ASU 2015-7 ). ASU 2015-7 provides amended guidance on the disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per
share (or its equivalent). The amendments remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the
requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected
to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. The guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2016. The Company adopted the new accounting guidance on January 1, 2016 and presented the fair value disclosures accordingly.  
 In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2015-15 , Interest Imputation of Interest (Sub-topic 835-30):
Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with   Line-of-Credit Arrangements  ( ASU 2015-15 ). ASU 2015-03 does not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to
line-of-credit arrangements. In accordance with ASU 2015-15, an entity may defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance  
      27  

Table of Contents  

costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. This guidance was effective for the
Company on January 1, 2016. The Company adopted the new accounting guidance and it did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS     The Company
applies fair value accounting in accordance with the terms of Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement  ( ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset
or transfer a liability in an orderly transfer between market participants at the measurement date. The Company values securities/instruments traded in active markets on the measurement date by multiplying the closing price of such traded
securities/instruments by the quantity of shares or amount of the instrument held. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments, such as its securities/instruments traded in active markets and its liquid
securities/instruments that are not traded in active markets, from pricing services, brokers, or counterparties (i.e.,  consensus pricing ). When doing so, the Company determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to
US GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. The Company may use the quote obtained or alternative pricing sources may be utilized including valuation techniques typically utilized for illiquid securities/instruments.  
 Securities/instruments that are illiquid or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation
or methodology that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser or GMS Finance s Board of Directors, does not represent fair value shall each be valued as of the measurement date using all techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for
which sufficient data is available. These valuation techniques may vary by investment and include comparable public market valuations, comparable precedent transaction valuations and/or discounted cash flow analyses. The process generally used to
determine the applicable value is as follows: (i) the value of each portfolio company or investment is initially reviewed by the investment professionals responsible for such portfolio company or investment and, for non-traded investments, a
standardized template designed to approximate fair market value based on observable market inputs, updated credit statistics and unobservable inputs is used to determine a preliminary value, which is also reviewed alongside consensus pricing, where
available; (ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and reviewed by a valuation committee comprised of members of senior management; (iii) the Board of Directors engages a third-party valuation firm to provide positive assurance on
portions of the Middle Market Senior Loans and equity investments portfolio each quarter (such that each non-traded investment other than Credit Fund and the 2015-1 Issuer is reviewed by a third-party valuation firm at least once on a rolling twelve
month basis) including a review of management s preliminary valuation and conclusion on fair value; (iv) the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the  Audit Committee ) reviews the assessments of the Investment Adviser and
the third-party valuation firm and provides the Board of Directors with any recommendations with respect to changes to the fair value of each investment in the portfolio; and (v) the Board of Directors discusses the valuation recommendations of
the Audit Committee and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser and, where applicable, the third-party valuation firm.  
 All factors that might materially impact the value of an investment are considered, including, but not limited to the assessment of the
following factors, as relevant:      

the nature and realizable value of any collateral;        

call features, put features and other relevant terms of debt;        

the portfolio company s leverage and ability to make payments;        

the portfolio company s public or private credit rating;        

the portfolio company s actual and expected earnings and discounted cash flow;    
      28  

Table of Contents  

prevailing interest rates and spreads for similar securities and expected volatility in future interest rates;        

the markets in which the portfolio company does business and recent economic and/or market events; and        

comparisons to comparable transactions and publicly traded securities.      Investment performance
data utilized are the most recently available financial statements and compliance certificates received from the portfolio companies as of the measurement date which in many cases may reflect a lag in information.  
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value
of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the
investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material.    In addition, changes in the market environment
and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the realized gains or losses on investments to be different from the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation currently reflected in the consolidated financial
statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    US GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the
level of observability of market price inputs used in measuring investments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment and state
of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Investments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally have a
higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.    Investments measured and
reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in determination of fair values, as follows:      

Level I inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The types of financial instruments in Level I generally include
unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact
the quoted price.        

Level II inputs to the valuation methodology are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date and are those other than quoted prices in active markets. The type of financial instruments in this
category generally includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on
observable inputs.        

Level III inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or
estimation. Financial instruments that are in this category generally include investments in privately-held entities, CLOs, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs.    
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an
investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Investment Adviser s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair
value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment.  
      29

  Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the
transfers occur. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no transfers between levels.  
 The following tables summarize the Company s investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the above fair value hierarchy
levels as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

 Amount represents the Company s subordinated loan and member s interest investments in Credit Fund. The fair value of these investments has been estimated using the net asset value of the Company s
ownership interests in Credit Fund.

  The Company generally uses the following framework when determining the fair value of investments
that are categorized as Level III:    Investments in debt securities are initially evaluated to determine whether the enterprise value of
the portfolio company is greater than the applicable debt. The enterprise value of the portfolio company is estimated using a market approach and an income approach. The market approach utilizes market value (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded
comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The Company carefully considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose multiples are used to value its portfolio companies. These
factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. The income approach typically uses a discounted cash flow
analysis of the portfolio company.    Investments in debt securities that do not have sufficient coverage through the enterprise value
analysis are valued based on an expected probability of default and discount recovery analysis.    Investments in debt securities with
sufficient coverage through the enterprise value analysis are generally valued using a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying security. Projected cash flows in the discounted cash flow typically represent the relevant security s
contractual interest, fees and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the security s expected maturity date. The discount rate to be used is determined using an average of two market-based methodologies.
Investments in debt securities may also be valued using consensus pricing.    Investments in structured finance obligations are generally
valued using a discounted cash flow and/or consensus pricing.    Investments in equities are generally valued using a market approach and/or
an income approach. The market approach utilizes EBITDA multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The income approach typically uses a discounted cash flow analysis of the
portfolio company.    Investments in the subordinated loan and member s interest of the investment fund are valued using the net asset
value of the Company s ownership interest in the investment fund and investments in the mezzanine loan of the investment fund are valued using the expected repayment rate.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investments in
first and second lien debt securities are discount rates and indicative quotes. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Significant decreases in indicative quotes in isolation may result
in a significantly lower fair value measurement.    The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the
Company s investments in structured finance obligations are discount rates, default rates, prepayment rates, recovery rates and indicative quotes. Significant increases in discount rates, default rates or prepayment rates in isolation would
result in a significantly lower fair value measurement, while a significant increase in recovery rates in isolation would result in a significantly higher fair value. Significant decreases in indicative quotes in isolation may result in a
significantly lower fair value measurement.   The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s
investments in equities are discount rates and comparable EBITDA multiples. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Significant decreases in comparable EBITDA multiples would result in a
significantly lower fair value measurement.      Financial instruments disclosed but not carried at fair value

  The carrying values of the secured borrowings approximate their respective fair values and are
categorized as Level III within the hierarchy. Secured borrowings are valued generally using discounted cash flow analysis. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s secured borrowings are discount
rates. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement.    The following table
represents the carrying values (before debt issuance costs) and fair values of the Company s 2015-1 Notes disclosed but not carried at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  
   
   The fair value determination of the Company s 2015-1 Notes was based on the market quotation(s) received
from broker/dealer(s). These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable and thus represent Level III measurements as defined in the accounting guidance for fair value measurement.  
 The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair value based on the short term nature of these items.  
  4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS       Investment Advisory
Agreement      On April 3, 2013, the Company s Board of Directors, including a majority of the directors who are not
 interested persons  as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act (the  Independent Directors ), approved an investment advisory agreement (the  Investment Advisory Agreement ) between the Company and
the Investment Adviser in accordance with, and on the basis of an evaluation satisfactory to such directors as required by, Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act. The initial term of the Investment Advisory Agreement is two years from April 3,
2013 and, unless terminated earlier, the Investment Advisory Agreement will renew automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the vote of the Board of Directors and by the
vote of a majority of the Independent Directors. On March 10, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, approved the continuance of the Advisory Agreement for a one year period. The Investment
Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an assignment and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon at least 60 days  written notice to the other party. Subject to the overall supervision of the Board of
Directors, the Investment Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Company. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives fees from the Company consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee.
   Prior to a Qualified IPO, the base management fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.50% of the
average daily gross assets of the Company for the period adjusted for share issuances or repurchases, excluding any cash and cash equivalents and including assets acquired with leverage from use of the Revolving Credit Facility, Facility and 2015-1
Notes (see Note 6, Borrowings, and Note 7, 2015-1 Notes). For purposes of this calculation, cash and cash equivalents include any temporary investments in cash-equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality investment grade debt
investments that mature in 12 months or less from the date of investment. Base management fees for any partial quarter are prorated. The Investment  
      36  

Table of Contents  

Adviser contractually waived one-third (0.50%) of the base management fee prior to a Qualified IPO (with no right of recapture). The fee waiver will terminate if and when a Qualified IPO has been
consummated.    The incentive fee has two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the pre-incentive
fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The second part is determined and payable in arrears based on capital gains as of the end of each calendar year.  
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees
for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the operating expenses
accrued for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred
stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest  
 and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any
realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.    Prior to any Qualified IPO of the
Company s common stock, pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the average daily Hurdle Calculation Value (as defined below) throughout the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a  hurdle
rate  of 1.50% per quarter (6% annualized).  Hurdle Calculation Value  means, on any given day, the sum of (x) the value of net assets as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding such day plus (y) the
aggregate amount of capital drawn from investors (or reinvested in the Company pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan) from the beginning of the current quarter to such day minus (z) the aggregate amount of distributions (including share
repurchases) made by the Company from the beginning of the current quarter to such day but only to the extent such distributions were not declared and accounted for on the books and records in a previous quarter.  
 GMS Finance pays its Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to its pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter
as follows:      

no incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income in any calendar quarter in which its pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle of 1.50%;    

100% of pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle but is less than 1.875% in any calendar quarter (7.50%
annualized). The Company refers to this portion of the pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle but is less than 1.875%) as the  catch-up.  The  catch-up  is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with
approximately 20% of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 1.875% in any calendar quarter; and    

20% of the amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 1.875% in any calendar quarter (7.50% annualized) will be payable to the Investment Adviser. This reflects that once the hurdle is
reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20% of all pre-incentive fee investment income thereafter is allocated to the Investment Adviser.    
 The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20% of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the date of determination, computed net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis
and unrealized capital depreciation, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees, provided that, the incentive fee determined at the end  
      37  

Table of Contents  

of the first calendar year of operations may be calculated for a period of shorter than twelve calendar months to take into account any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital
losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized capital depreciation.    The Company will defer payment of any incentive fee otherwise earned by
the Investment Adviser if, during the most recent four full calendar quarter periods (or, if less, the number of full calendar quarters completed since the initial drawdown of capital from the stockholders,  Initial Drawdown ) ending on or
prior to the date such payment is to be made, the sum of (a) the aggregate distributions to stockholders and (b) the change in net assets (defined as gross assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable
during the period) is less than 6.0% of net assets (defined as gross assets less indebtedness) at the beginning of such period, provided, that such percentage will be appropriately prorated during the four full calendar quarters immediately
following the Initial Drawdown. These calculations are adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases. Any deferred incentive fees are carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods. The Investment Adviser may earn an incentive fee
under the Investment Advisory Agreement on the Company s repurchase of debt issued by the Company at a gain.    Prior to a Qualified
IPO, from time to time, CGMSIM intends to pay certain individuals providing services to CGMSIM, including individuals who serve as our executive officer and/or director and individuals who are members of the CGMSIM team managing our investments (the
 CGMSIM Investment Team ), a portion of each installment of the gross incentive fees that CGMSIM receives from us in consideration of their services on behalf of CGMSIM, with approximately 25% of the net after-tax amount paid to such
members being paid in the form of newly issued shares of common stock purchased from us. In addition, following the completion of a Qualified IPO, from time to time, CGMSIM intends to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market at a
purchase price, in the aggregate, equal to approximately 25% of each installment of the net after- tax incentive fees that CGMSIM receives from us, subject to market conditions. CGMSIM may then distribute those shares to individuals eligible for
such payment in consideration of their services on behalf of CGMSIM.    For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016,
base management fees were $3,132 and $8,789, respectively (net of waiver of $1,567 and $4,395, respectively), incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment income were $3,962 and $10,318, respectively, and there were no incentive fees
related to realized capital gains. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, base management fees were $2,452 and $6,321, respectively (net of waiver of $1,227 and $3,161, respectively), incentive fees related to
pre-incentive fee net investment income were $2,584 and $6,190, respectively, and there were no incentive fees related to realized capital gains. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no accrued
capital gains incentive fees based upon the cumulative net realized and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under US GAAP in a given period may
result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there
is no accrual.    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $16,142 and $5,277, respectively, was included in base management and
incentive fees payable in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.    On April 3, 2013, the Investment
Adviser entered into a personnel agreement with The Carlyle Group Employee Co., L.L.C. ( Carlyle Employee Co. ), an affiliate of the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which Carlyle Employee Co. provides the Investment Adviser with access to

will renew automatically for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i) the vote of the Board of Directors or by a majority vote of the outstanding voting securities of the Company and
(ii) the vote of a majority of the Company s Independent Directors. On March 10, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors, including a majority of the Independent Directors, approved the continuance of the Administration Agreement for a one
year period. The Administration Agreement may not be assigned by a party without the consent of the other party and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon at least 60 days  written notice to the other party.

  5. MIDDLE MARKET CREDIT FUND, LLC       Overview
     On February 29, 2016, the Company and Credit Partners entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement to co-manage Credit
Fund, an unconsolidated Delaware limited liability company. Credit Fund primarily invests in first lien loans of middle-market companies. Credit Fund is managed by a six-member board of managers, on which the Company and Credit Partners each have
equal representation. The Company and Credit Partners each have 50% economic ownership of Credit Fund and have commitments to fund, from time to time, capital of up to $400,000 each. Funding of such commitments generally requires the approval of the
board of Credit Fund, including the board members appointed by the Company.    Together with Credit Partners, the Company co-invests through
Credit Fund. Portfolio and investment decisions with respect to Credit Fund must be unanimously approved by a quorum of Credit Fund s investment committee consisting of an equal number of representatives of the Company and Credit Partners.
Therefore, although the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities of Credit Fund, the Company does not believe that it has control over Credit Fund (other than for purposes of the Investment Company Act).  
 Middle Market Credit Fund SPV, LLC (the  Credit Fund Sub ), a Delaware limited liability company, was formed on April 5, 2016.
Credit Fund Sub primarily invests in first lien loans of middle-market companies. Credit Fund Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Credit Fund and is consolidated in Credit Fund s consolidated financial statements commencing from the date of its
formation.

pre-determined future interest rate increases of 0.875%-1.75% over the two years following the end of the revolving period. The Borrower Sub is also required to pay an undrawn commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.75% per year depending on the usage
of the Revolving Credit Facility. Payments under the Revolving Credit Facility are made quarterly. The lenders have a first lien security interest on substantially all of the assets of the Borrower Sub.  
 As part of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Borrower Sub is subject to limitations as to how borrowed funds may be used and the types of
loans that are eligible to be acquired by the Borrower Sub including, but not limited to, restrictions on sector and geographic concentrations, loan size, payment frequency, tenor and minimum investment ratings (or estimated ratings). In addition,
borrowed funds are intended to be used primarily to purchase first lien loan assets, and the Borrower Sub is limited in its ability to purchase certain other assets (including, but not limited to, second lien loans, covenant-lite loans, revolving
and delayed draw loans and discount loans) and other assets are not permitted to be purchased (including, but not limited to paid-in-kind loans and structured finance obligations). The Revolving Credit Facility has certain requirements relating to
interest coverage, collateral quality and portfolio performance, including limitations on delinquencies and charge offs, certain violations of which could result in the immediate acceleration of the amounts due under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Revolving Credit Facility is also subject to a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to assets held by the Borrower Sub based generally on the fair market value of such assets. Under certain circumstances as set forth in the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Company could be obliged to repurchase loans from the Borrower Sub.

  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Borrower Sub was in compliance with all
covenants and other requirements of the Revolving Credit Facility.      Facility    
 The Company closed on March 21, 2014 on the Facility, which was subsequently amended on January 8, 2015 and May 25, 2016 (the  Second
Facility Amendment ). The maximum principal amount of the Facility is $220,000, subject to availability under the Facility, which is based on certain advance rates multiplied by the value of the Company s portfolio investments (subject to
certain concentration limitations) net of certain other indebtedness that the Company may incur in accordance with the terms of the Facility. Proceeds of the Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio
investments. Maximum capacity under the Facility may be increased to $225,000 through the exercise by the Company of an uncommitted accordion feature through which existing and new lenders may, at their option, agree to provide additional financing.
The Facility includes a $20,000 limit for swingline loans and a $5,000 limit for letters of credit. The Company may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Amounts drawn under the Facility, including amounts drawn in
respect of letters of credit, bear interest at either LIBOR plus an applicable spread of 2.25%, or an  alternative base rate  (which is the highest of a prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, or one month LIBOR plus
1.00%) plus an applicable spread of 1.25%. The Company may elect either the LIBOR or the  alternative base rate  at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. The
Company also pays a fee of 0.375% on undrawn amounts under the Facility and, in respect of each undrawn letter of credit, a fee and interest rate equal to the then-applicable margin under the Facility while the letter of credit is outstanding. The
availability period under the Facility will terminate on March 21, 2020 and the Facility will mature on March 21, 2021. During the period from March 21, 2020 to March 21, 2021, the Company will be obligated to make mandatory prepayments under the
Facility out of the proceeds of certain asset sales, other recovery events and equity and debt issuances.    Subject to certain exceptions,
the Facility is secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all of the portfolio investments held by the Company and the Company s unfunded investor equity capital commitments (provided that the amount of unfunded capital
commitments ultimately available to the lenders is limited to $100,000). The pledge of unfunded investor equity capital commitments was subject to release once $100,000 of incremental capital had been called and received by the Company subsequent to
January 8, 2015. The pledge of unfunded investor equity capital commitments had been released as of September 30, 2016. The Facility includes customary covenants, including certain financial covenants related to asset coverage, shareholders 
equity and liquidity, certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, and other maintenance covenants, as well as usual and customary events of default for senior secured revolving credit facilities of this nature.  
 Related to the Second Facility Amendment, $380 of deferred financing costs (representing the prorated financing costs related to a departing
lender) were immediately expensed on May 25, 2016 in lieu of continuing to amortize over the term of the Facility.    As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and other requirements of the Facility.

 The unused portion is the amount upon which commitment fees are based.    

(2) 
 Available for borrowing based on the computation of collateral to support the borrowings.      As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $1,365 and $966, respectively, of interest expense, $250 and $141, respectively, of unused commitment fees and $22 and $22, respectively, of other fees were included in interest and credit facility

ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the components of interest expense and credit facility fees on the facilities were as follows:      
    7. 2015-1 Notes   
 On June 26, 2015, the Company completed the 2015-1 Debt Securitization. The 2015-1 Notes were issued by the 2015-1 Issuer, a wholly-owned and
consolidated subsidiary of the Company, and are secured by a diversified portfolio of the 2015-1 Issuer consisting primarily of first and second lien senior secured loans. The 2015-1 Debt Securitization was executed through a private placement of
the 2015-1 Notes, consisting of $160 million of Aaa/AAA Class A-1A Notes which bear interest at the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate  
      47  

Table of Contents  

( LIBOR ) plus 1.85%; $40 million of Aaa/AAA Class A-1B Notes which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 1.75% for the first 24 months and the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05%
thereafter; $27 million of Aaa/AAA Class A-1C Notes which bear interest at 3.75%; and $46 million of Aa2 Class A-2 Notes which bear interest at the three month LIBOR plus 2.70%. The 2015-1 Notes were issued at par and are scheduled to mature on July
15, 2027. The Company received 100% of the preferred interests (the  Preferred Interests ) issued by the 2015-1 Issuer on the closing date of the 2015-1 Debt Securitization in exchange for the Company s contribution to the Issuer of
the initial closing date loan portfolio. The Preferred Interests do not bear interest and had a nominal value of $125.9 million at closing. In connection with the contribution, the Company made customary representations, warranties and covenants to
the 2015-1 Issuer in the purchase agreement. The Class A-1A, Class A-1B and Class A-1C and Class A-2 Notes are included in the September 30, 2016 consolidated financial statements. The Preferred Interests were eliminated in consolidation.  
 On the closing date of the 2015-1 Debt Securitization, the 2015-1 Issuer effected a one-time distribution to the Company of a substantial
portion of the proceeds of the private placement of the 2015-1 Notes, net of expenses, which distribution was used to repay a portion of certain amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Facility. As part of the 2015-1 Debt
Securitization, certain first and second lien senior secured loans were distributed by the Borrower Sub to the Company pursuant to a distribution and contribution agreement. The Company contributed the loans that comprised the initial closing date
loan portfolio (including the loans distributed to the Company from the Borrower Sub) to the 2015-1 Issuer pursuant to a contribution agreement. Future loan transfers from the Company to the 2015-1 Issuer will be made pursuant to a sale agreement
and are subject to the approval of the Company s Board of Directors. Assets of the 2015-1 Issuer are not available to the creditors of the Borrower Sub or the Company. In connection with the issuance and sale of the 2015-1 Notes, the Company
made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the purchase agreement.    During the reinvestment period, pursuant to the
indenture governing the 2015-1 Notes, all principal collections received on the underlying collateral may be used by the 2015-1 Issuer to purchase new collateral under the direction of Investment Adviser in its capacity as collateral manager of the
2015-1 Issuer and in accordance with the Company s investment strategy.    The Investment Adviser serves as collateral manager to the
2015-1 Issuer under a collateral management agreement (the  Collateral Management Agreement ). Pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement, the 2015-1 Issuer pays management fees (comprised of base management fees, subordinated
management fees and incentive management fees) ( Management Fees ) to the Investment Adviser for rendering collateral management services. As per the Collateral Management Agreement, for the period the Company retains all of the Preferred
Interests, the Investment Adviser does not earn Management Fees for providing such collateral management services. The Company currently retains all of the Preferred Interests, thus the Investment Adviser did not earn any management fees from the
2015-1 Issuer for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. Any such waived fees may not be recaptured by the Investment Adviser.  
 Pursuant to an undertaking by the Company in connection with the 2015-1 Debt Securitization, the Company has agreed to hold on an ongoing
basis Preferred Interests with an aggregate dollar purchase price at least equal to 5% of the aggregate outstanding amount of all collateral obligations by the 2015-1 Issuer for so long as any securities of the 2015-1 Issuer remain outstanding. As
of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with its undertaking.    The 2015-1 Issuer pays ongoing administrative expenses to the
trustee, independent accountants, legal counsel, rating agencies and independent managers in connection with developing and maintaining reports, and providing required services in connection with the administration of the 2015-1 Issuer. 
 As of September 30, 2016, there were 57 first lien and second lien senior secured loans with a total fair value of approximately $389,197
securing the 2015-1 Notes. The pool of loans in the securitization must meet certain requirements, including asset mix and concentration, term, agency rating, collateral coverage, minimum coupon, minimum spread and sector diversity requirements in
the indenture governing the 2015-1 Notes.

  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the effective annualized weighted average interest
rate, which includes amortization of debt issuance costs on the 2015-1 Notes, was 2.84% based on floating LIBOR rates.    For the three
month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the components of interest expense on the 2015-1 Notes were as follows:      
    8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   
 A summary of significant contractual payment obligations was as follows as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  
   
   In the ordinary course of its business, the Company enters into contracts or agreements that contain
indemnification and warranties. Future events could occur that lead to the execution of these provisions against the Company. The Company believes that the likelihood of such an event is remote; however, the maximum potential exposure is unknown. No
accrual has been made in the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for any such exposure.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $1,210,870 and $1,174,340, respectively, in total capital commitments
from stockholders, of which $445,642 and $559,214, respectively, was unfunded. As of September 30, 2016, current directors had committed $608 in capital commitments to the Company.  
 The Company had the following unfunded commitments to fund delayed draw and revolving senior secured loans as of the indicated dates:  
   
   As of September 30, 2016, the Company had remaining commitments to fund, from time to time, capital to Credit
Fund of up to $375,999. Funding of such commitments generally requires the approval of the board of Credit Fund, including the board members appointed by the Company. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had remaining commitments to fund, from time
to time, mezzanine loans to Credit Fund of up to $68,200, of which $1,280 was available for borrowing based on the computation of collateral to support the borrowings.

*  
   Represents shares issued upon the reinvestment of dividends    
 Subscribed but unissued shares are presented in equity with a deduction of subscriptions receivable until cash is received for a subscription.
There were no subscribed but unissued shares as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    Subscription transactions during the
nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were executed at an offering price at a premium to net asset value due to the requirement to use prior quarter net asset value as offering price unless it would result in the Company selling
shares of its common stock at a price below the current net asset value and also in order to effect a reallocation of organizational costs to subsequent investors. Such subscription transactions increased net asset value by $0.02 per share and $0.09
per share, respectively, for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    The Company computes earnings per
common share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share . Basic earnings per common share were calculated by dividing net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations attributable to the Company by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period.    Basic and diluted earnings per common share were as follows:

 The following is a schedule of consolidated financial highlights for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

53  

Table of Contents  

(1) 
 Net investment income (loss) per share was calculated as net investment income (loss) for the period divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.    

(2) 
 Dividends declared per share was calculated as the sum of dividends declared during the period divided by the number of shares outstanding at each respective quarter-end date (refer to Note 9).    

(3) 
 Increase is due to offering price of subscriptions during the period (refer to Note 9).    

(4) 
 Total return (not annualized) is based on the change in net asset value per share during the period plus the declared dividends, assuming reinvestment of dividends in accordance with the dividend reinvestment plan,
divided by the beginning net asset value for the period. Total return for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is inclusive of $0.02 and $0.09, respectively, per share increase in net asset value for the periods related to the
offering price of subscriptions. Excluding the effects of the higher offering price of subscriptions, total return (not annualized) would have been 7.83% and 6.52%, respectively (refer to Note 9).    

(5) 
 These ratios to average net assets have not been annualized.    

(6) 
 The net investment income ratio is net of the waiver of base management fees.       11. LITIGATION   
 The Company may become party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of current
matters, if any, will materially impact the Company or its consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was not subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to the Company s knowledge,
is any material legal proceeding threatened against the Company.    In addition, portfolio investments of the Company could be the subject
of litigation or regulatory investigations in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any current contingent liabilities of its portfolio investments, if any, will materially affect the Company or these
consolidated financial statements.     12. TAX   
 The Company has not recorded a liability for any uncertain tax positions pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740,  Income Taxes,  as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and
certain state, local and foreign tax regulators. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had filed tax returns and therefore is subject to examination.  
 The Company s taxable income for each period is an estimate and will not be finally determined until the Company files its tax return for
each year. Therefore, the final taxable income, and the taxable income earned in each period and carried forward for distribution in the following period, may be different than this estimate. The estimated tax character of dividends declared for the
nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

  OVERVIEW      Management s Discussion
and Analysis should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q  Financial Statements.  This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to
those described in Part I, Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q  Risk Factors.  Actual results may differ materially from those contained in
any forward-looking statements.     Carlyle GMS Finance, Inc. ( we,   us,   our,   GMS Finance, 
or the  Company ) is a Maryland corporation formed on February 8, 2012, and structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company. GMS Finance has elected to be regulated as a business development company
( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the  Investment Company Act ). GMS Finance has elected to be treated, and intends to continue to
comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the  Code ).  
 GMS Finance s investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments in U.S.
middle market companies, which we define as companies with approximately $10 million to $100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ). GMS Finance seeks to achieve its investment objective by
investing primarily in first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans; first lien/last out loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind first lien/first out loans;  unitranche  loans, which
are loans that combine features of first lien, second lien or subordinated loans, generally in a first lien position; and secured corporate bonds with features similar to the features of these categories of first lien loans) and second lien senior
secured loans (which may include senior secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first lien loans) (collectively,  Middle Market Senior Loans ). The Middle Market Senior Loans are
generally made to private U.S. middle market companies that are, in many cases, controlled by private equity firms. Depending on market conditions, GMS Finance expects that between 70% and 80% of the value of its assets will be invested in Middle
Market Senior Loans, with the balance invested in higher-yielding investments, which may include middle market junior loans such as corporate mezzanine loans, equity co-investments, broadly syndicated first lien and second lien senior secured loans,
high-yield bonds, structured finance obligations and/or other opportunistic investments. We expect that the composition of our portfolio will change over time given our Investment Adviser s view on, among other things, the economic and credit
environment (including with respect to interest rates) in which we are operating.    GMS Finance is externally managed by the Investment
Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Administrator provides the administrative services necessary for GMS Finance to operate. Both the Investment Adviser and the Administrator are
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C., a subsidiary of The Carlyle Group L.P.  Carlyle  refers to The Carlyle Group L.P., its affiliates and its consolidated subsidiaries, a global alternative asset manager
publicly traded on NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol  CG . Refer to the sec.gov website for further information on Carlyle.  
 On February 29, 2016, the Company and Credit Partners USA LLC ( Credit Partners ) entered into an amended and restated limited
liability company agreement (as amended, the  Limited Liability Company Agreement ) to co-manage Middle Market Credit Fund, LLC ( Credit Fund ). Credit Fund primarily invests in first lien loans of middle-market companies. Credit
Fund is managed by a six-member board of managers, on which the Company and Credit Partners each have equal representation. The Company and Credit Partners each have 50% economic ownership of Credit Fund and have commitments to fund, from time to
time, capital of up to $400,000 each .

    Investments    
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt
available to middle market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make.      Revenue
     We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments we hold and capital gains, if any, on
investments. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and generally bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as LIBOR. Interest on these debt investments is generally paid
quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding    balances. In
addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of
sales of securities. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees.  
   Expenses      Our primary operating
expenses include the payment of: (i) investment advisory fees, including base management fees and incentive fees, to our Investment Adviser pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the  Investment Advisory Agreement ) between us and
our Investment Adviser; (ii) costs and other expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under an administration agreement (the  Administration Agreement )

 Weighted average yields do not include the effect of accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums and are based on interest rates as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Actual yields earned over the life

 See the Consolidated Schedules of Investments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 in our consolidated financial statements in Part
I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information on these investments, including a list of companies and type and amount of investments.  
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile
of each of our debt investments and rates each of them based on the following categories, which we refer to as  Internal Risk Ratings :  
   Internal Risk Ratings Definitions        

Rating   
    
    Definition    

1  
    
  Performing Low Risk:  Borrower is operating more than 10% ahead of the Base Case.  
 
   2  
    
  Performing Stable Risk:  Borrower is operating within 10% of the Base Case (above or below). This is the initial rating assigned to all new borrowers.  
 
   3  
    
  Performing Management Notice:  Borrower is operating more than 10% below the Base Case. A financial covenant default may have occurred, but there is a low risk of payment default.  
 
   4  
    
  Watch List:  Borrower is operating more than 20% below the Base Case and there is a high risk of covenant default, or it may have already occurred. Payments are current although subject to greater uncertainty, and there is
moderate to high risk of payment default.  
 
   5  
    
  Watch List Possible Loss:  Borrower is operating more than 30% below the Base Case. At the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or
refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Payment default is very likely or may have occurred. Loss of principal is possible.  
 
   6  
    
  Watch List Probable Loss:  Borrower is operating more than 40% below the Base Case, and at the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay
or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Payment default is very likely or may have already occurred. Additionally, the prospects for improvement in the borrower s situation are sufficiently negative that impairment of some or all
principal is probable.  
   Our Investment Adviser s risk rating model is based on evaluating portfolio company performance in
comparison to the Base Case when considering certain credit metrics including, but not limited to, adjusted EBITDA and net senior leverage as well as specific events including, but not limited to, default and impairment.

  Our Investment Adviser monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to
each debt investment in our portfolio. In connection with our quarterly valuation process, our Investment Adviser reviews our investment ratings on a regular basis. The following table summarizes the Internal Risk Ratings as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015:      
   As part of our monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk policies pursuant to which it
regularly assesses the risk profile of each of the structured finance obligation investments.    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the weighted average Internal Risk Rating of our debt investment portfolio was 2.2 and 2.1, respectively.     CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
      For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
 The net increase or decrease in net assets from operations may vary substantially from period to period as a result of various factors,
including the recognition of realized gains and losses and net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, quarterly comparisons may not be meaningful.  
  Investment Income     Interest income for
the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:      
   The increase in interest and dividend income for the three month and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 from the comparable periods in 2015 was driven by our deployment of capital, increasing invested balance and a dividend declared by Credit Fund. As of September 30, 2016, the size of our portfolio increased to $1,389,472 from
$982,026 as of September 30, 2015, at amortized cost, and total principal amount of investments outstanding increased to $1,437,034 from $1,039,912 as of September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the weighted average yield of our first and
second lien debt increased to 7.98% from 7.30% as of September 30, 2015, on amortized cost.  
      62  

Table of Contents  

  Interest income on our first and second lien debt investments is dependent on the composition and
credit quality of the portfolio. Generally, we expect the portfolio to generate predictable quarterly interest income based on the terms stated in each loan s credit agreement. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, all of our first and second lien
debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments. Interest income from structured finance obligations is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows. The effective
yield is updated at least quarterly based on payments received and expected future payments. In estimating these cash flows, there are a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties, including the amount and timing of principal payments
which are impacted by prepayments, repurchases, defaults, delinquencies and liquidations of or within the CLO funds that issued the structured finance obligations. These uncertainties are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that
could have impacted the Company s estimates if the information was known at the time of such estimates. As a result, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.  
 Net investment income for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

Table of Contents  

  Interest expense and credit facility fees for the three month and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were comprised of the following:      
   The increase in interest expense for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 from the
comparable periods in 2015 was driven by increased usage of the Company s credit facilities, additional debt issued through the securitization in the form of the 2015-1 Notes (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part
I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information), and increased deployment of capital to investments. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate under the facilities was 2.75% and 2.67%,
respectively, and average principal debt outstanding was $292,084 and $277,575, respectively. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the weighted average interest rate under the facilities was 2.28% and 2.22%,
respectively, and average principal debt outstanding was $167,952 and $285,547, respectively.    The increase in base management fees (and
related waiver of base management fees) and incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment income for the three month and nine month period ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable periods in 2015 were driven by our deployment
of capital and increasing invested balance. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ) in a given period may result in an additional expense if such
cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. See Note 4 to the
consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information on the incentive and base management fees. For the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no
capital gains incentive fees based upon the cumulative net realized and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Professional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the
management of the Company. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement,
including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staff. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, subscriptions and other costs.  
  Net Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments   
 During the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a change in unrealized appreciation on 69 and 86
investments, respectively, totaling approximately $19,587 and $34,680, respectively, which was offset by a change in unrealized depreciation on 32 and 25 investments, respectively, totaling approximately $6,807 and $14,484, respectively. During the
three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the Company had a change in unrealized appreciation on 38 and 64 investments, respectively, totaling approximately $7,122 and $13,956, respectively, which was offset by a change in
unrealized depreciation on 60 and 47 investments, respectively, totaling approximately $8,626 and $11,211, respectively.

   Net realized gain (loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) by the type of investments
for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:      
     
   Net change in unrealized depreciation in our investments for the three month and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable periods in 2015 was primarily due to changes in various inputs utilized under our valuation methodology, including, but not limited to, market spreads, leverage multiples and borrower ratings.  
  MIDDLE MARKET CREDIT FUND, LLC       Overview
     On February 29, 2016, the Company and Credit Partners entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement to co-manage Credit
Fund, an unconsolidated Delaware limited liability company. Credit Fund primarily invests in first lien loans of middle-market companies. Credit Fund is managed by a six-member board  
      65  

Table of Contents  

of managers, on which the Company and Credit Partners each have equal representation. The Company and Credit Partners each have 50% economic ownership of Credit Fund and have commitments to fund,
from time to time, capital of up to $400,000 each. Funding of such commitment generally requires the approval of the board of Credit Fund, including the board members appointed by the Company.  
 Together with Credit Partners, the Company co-invests through Credit Fund. Portfolio and investment decisions with respect to Credit Fund must
be unanimously approved by a quorum of Credit Fund s investment committee consisting of an equal number of representatives of the Company and Credit Partners. Therefore, although the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities of Credit
Fund, the Company does not believe that it has control over Credit Fund (other than for purposes of the Investment Company Act). Middle Market Credit Fund SPV, LLC (the  Credit Fund Sub ), a Delaware limited liability company, was formed
on April 5, 2016. Credit Fund Sub primarily invests in first lien loans of middle-market companies. Credit Fund Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Credit Fund and is consolidated in Credit Fund s consolidated financial statements commencing
from the date of its formation.      Selected Financial Data    
 Since inception of Credit Fund and through September 30, 2016, the Company and Credit Partners each made capital contributions of $1 in
members  equity and $24,000 in subordinated loans to Credit Fund. Additionally, Credit Fund borrowed $31,800 in mezzanine loans under a revolving credit facility with the Company (the  Credit Fund Facility ). As of September 30, 2016,
Credit Fund had subordinated loans and members  capital of $51,917 and mezzanine loans of $31,800. The Company s ownership interest in such subordinated loans and members  capital was $25,958 and in such mezzanine loans was $31,800.
   As of September 30, 2016, Credit Fund held cash and cash equivalents totaling $4,076.  
 As of September 30, 2016, Credit Fund had total investments at fair value of $292,830, which was comprised of first lien senior secured loans
and second lien senior secured loans to 20 portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2016 and for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, no loans in Credit Fund s portfolio were on non-accrual status or contained PIK
provisions. The portfolio companies in Credit Fund are U.S. middle market companies in industries similar to those in which the Company may invest directly. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016, Credit Fund had commitments to fund various undrawn
revolvers and delayed draw investments to its portfolio companies totaling $35,059.    Below is a summary of Credit Fund s portfolio,

Debt       Credit
Fund Facility     Credit Fund closed on June 24, 2016 on a revolving credit facility, the Credit Fund Facility, from which Credit Fund may
from time to time request mezzanine loans from the Company. The maximum principal amount of the Credit Fund Facility is $100,000.    During
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, there were mezzanine loans borrowings of $54,200 and repayments of $22,400 under the Credit Fund Facility. As of September 30, 2016, there were $31,800 in mezzanine loans outstanding.  
  Credit Fund Sub Facility     Credit Fund Sub
closed on June 24, 2016 on the Credit Fund Sub Facility. The Credit Fund Sub Facility provides for secured borrowings during the applicable revolving period up to an amount equal to $440,000, with an accordion feature that can increase the aggregate
maximum credit commitment up to an amount not to exceed $1,400,000. The Facility is secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all of the portfolio investments held by Credit Fund Sub and the Company s and Credit Partners 
unfunded capital commitments.    During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, there were secured borrowings of $206,075 under the
Credit Fund Sub Facility. As of September 30, 2016, there was $206,075 in secured borrowings outstanding.     FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES     We generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings of our common stock and through cash flows from operations, including
investment sales and repayments as well as income earned on investments and cash equivalents. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under the Borrower Sub s senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the
 Revolving Credit Facility ) and/or the Company s senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the  Facility ), as well as through securitization of a portion of our existing investments.  
 The Borrower Sub closed on May 24, 2013 on the Revolving Credit Facility, which was subsequently amended on June 30, 2014, June 19, 2015 and
June 9, 2016. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for secured borrowings during the applicable revolving period up to an amount equal to the lesser of $400,000 (the  
      69  

Table of Contents  

borrowing base as calculated pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility) and the amount of net cash proceeds and unpledged capital commitments the Company has received, with an
accordion feature that can, subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate maximum credit commitment up to an amount not to exceed $750,000, subject to restrictions imposed on borrowings under the Investment Company Act and certain
restrictions and conditions set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility, including adequate collateral to support such borrowings. The Revolving Credit Facility imposes financial and operating covenants on us and the Borrower Sub that restrict our
and its business activities. Continued compliance with these covenants will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.  
 The Company closed on March 21, 2014 on the Facility, which was subsequently amended on January 8, 2015 and May 25, 2016. The maximum
principal amount of the Facility is $220,000, subject to availability under the Facility, which is based on certain advance rates multiplied by the value of the Company s portfolio investments (subject to certain concentration limitations) net
of certain other indebtedness that the Company may incur in accordance with the terms of the Facility. Proceeds of the Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments. Maximum capacity under the
Facility may be increased to $225,000 through the exercise by the Company of an uncommitted accordion feature through which existing and new lenders may, at their option, agree to provide additional financing. The Facility includes a $20,000 limit
for swingline loans and a $5,000 limit for letters of credit. Subject to certain exceptions, the Facility is secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all of the portfolio investments held by the Company. The Facility includes
customary covenants, including certain financial covenants related to asset coverage, shareholders  equity and liquidity, certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, and other maintenance covenants, as well as
usual and customary events of default for senior secured revolving credit facilities of this nature.    Although we believe that we and the
Borrower Sub will remain in compliance, there are no assurances that we or the Borrower Sub will continue to comply with the covenants in the Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, as applicable. Failure to comply with these covenants could result
in a default under the Facility and/or Revolving Credit Facility that, if we or the Borrower Sub were unable to obtain a waiver from the applicable lenders, could result in the immediate acceleration of the amounts due under the Facility and/or
Revolving Credit Facility, and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    For
more information on the Revolving Credit Facility and Facility, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.  
 The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for investments in portfolio companies, repayment of
indebtedness, cash distributions to our stockholders and for other general corporate purposes.    On June 26, 2015, the Company completed a
$400 million term debt securitization (the  2015-1 Debt Securitization ). The notes offered in the Debt Securitization (the  2015-1 Notes ) were issued by Carlyle GMS Finance MM CLO 2015-1 LLC (the  2015-1 Issuer ), a
wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary of the Company, and are secured by a diversified portfolio of the 2015-1 Issuer consisting primarily of first and second lien senior secured loans. The 2015-1 Debt Securitization was executed through a
private placement of the 2015-1 Notes, consisting of $160 million of Aaa/AAA Class A-1A Notes, which bear interest at the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 1.85%; $40 million of Aaa/AAA Class A-1B Notes, which bear
interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 1.75% for the first 24 months and the three-month LIBOR plus 2.05% thereafter; $27 million of Aaa/AAA Class A-1C Notes, which bear interest at 3.75%; and $46 million of Aa2 Class A-2 Notes which bear interest
at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.70%. The 2015-1 Notes were issued at par and are scheduled to mature on July 15, 2027. The Company received 100% of the preferred interests (the  Preferred Interests ) issued by the 2015-1 Issuer on the
closing date of the 2015-1 Debt Securitization in exchange for the Company s contribution to the Issuer of the initial closing date loan portfolio. The Preferred  
      70  

Table of Contents  

Interests do not bear interest and had a nominal value of $125.9 million at closing. In connection with the contribution, the Company has made customary representations, warranties and covenants
to the 2015-1 Issuer. The Class A-1A, Class A-1B and Class A-1C and Class A-2 Notes are included in the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. The Preferred Interests were eliminated in consolidation. For
more information on the 2015-1 Notes, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.    As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $49,841 and $41,837, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. The facilities of the Company and the Borrower Sub consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016 and

the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, we incurred $2,658 and $6,567, respectively, of interest expense and $282 and $587, respectively, of unused commitment fees.  
  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS     In the
ordinary course of its business, the Company enters into contracts or agreements that contain indemnification and warranties. Future events could occur that lead to the execution of these provisions against the Company. The Company believes that the
likelihood of such an event is remote; however, the maximum potential exposure is unknown. No accrual has been made in these consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included in Part I, Item 1 of
this Form 10-Q for any such exposure.    We have in the past and may in the future become obligated to fund commitments such as revolving
credit facilities, bridge financing commitments, or delayed draw commitments.    The Company had the following unfunded commitments to fund
delayed draw and revolving senior secured loans as of the indicated dates:

  Pursuant to an undertaking by the Company in connection with the 2015-1 Debt Securitization, the
Company agreed to hold on an ongoing basis Preferred Interests with an aggregate dollar purchase price at least equal to 5% of the aggregate outstanding amount of all collateral obligations by the 2015-1 Issuer for so long as any securities of the
2015-1 Issuer remains outstanding. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with its undertaking.    As of September 30,
2016, the Company had remaining commitments to fund, from time to time, capital to Credit Fund of up to $375,999. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had remaining commitments to fund, from time to time, mezzanine loans to Credit Fund of up to
$68,200, of which $1,280 was available for borrowing based on the computation of collateral to support the borrowings.     DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO
COMMON STOCKHOLDERS     The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any distributions on behalf
of its stockholders, for those who have elected to participate in the plan. As a result of adopting such a plan, if the Board of Directors authorizes and declares a cash dividend or distribution, the stockholders who have elected to participate in
the dividend reinvestment plan would have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock, rather than receiving cash. Prior to a Qualified IPO, the Company intends to use
primarily newly issued shares of its common stock to implement the plan issued at the net asset value per share most recently determined by the Board of Directors. After a Qualified IPO, the Company intends to use primarily newly issued shares to
implement the plan so long as the market value per share is equal to or greater than the net asset value per share as of the close of business on the relevant payment date for such dividend or distribution. If the market value per share is less than
the net asset value per share as of the close of business on the relevant payment date, the plan administrator would purchase the common stock on behalf of participants in the open market, unless the Company instructs the plan administrator
otherwise.    The following table summarizes the Company s dividends declared and payable since inception through September 30, 2016:

 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to

differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection
with our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in Part II, Item 8 of the Company s annual report on Form  10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
   Fair Value Measurements      The
Company applies fair value accounting in accordance with the terms of Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement  ( ASC 820 ). ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be exchanged to sell
an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transfer between market participants at the measurement date. The Company values securities/instruments traded in active markets on the measurement date by multiplying the closing price of such traded
securities/instruments by the quantity of shares or amount of the instrument held. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments, such as its securities/instruments traded in active markets and its liquid
securities/instruments that are not traded in active markets, from pricing services, brokers, or counterparties (i.e.,  consensus pricing ). When doing so, the Company determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to
US GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. The Company may use the quote obtained or alternative pricing sources may be utilized including valuation techniques typically utilized for illiquid securities/instruments.  
 Securities/instruments that are illiquid or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation
or methodology that, in the judgment of the Investment Adviser or the Board of Directors, does not represent fair value shall each be valued as of the measurement date using all techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which sufficient
data is available. These valuation techniques may vary by investment and include comparable public market valuations, comparable precedent transaction valuations and/or discounted cash flow analyses. The process generally used to determine the
applicable value is as follows: (i) the value of each portfolio company or investment is initially reviewed by the investment professionals responsible for such portfolio company or investment and, for non-traded investments, a
standardized template designed to approximate fair market value based on observable market inputs, updated credit statistics and unobservable inputs is used to determine a preliminary value, which is also reviewed alongside consensus pricing, where
available; (ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and reviewed by a valuation committee comprised of members of senior management; (iii) the Board of Directors engages a third-party valuation firm to provide positive
assurance on portions of the Middle Market Senior Loans and equity investments portfolio each quarter (such that each non-traded investment other than Credit Fund and the 2015-1 Issuer is reviewed by a third-party valuation firm at least once on a
rolling twelve month basis) including a review of management s preliminary valuation and conclusion on fair value; (iv) the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the  Audit Committee ) reviews the assessments of the
Investment Adviser and the third-party valuation firm and provides the Board of Directors with any recommendations with respect to changes to the fair value of each investment in the portfolio; and (v) the Board of Directors discusses the
valuation recommendations of the Audit Committee and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser and, where applicable, the third-party valuation firm.  
 All factors that might materially impact the value of an investment are considered, including, but not limited to the assessment of the
following factors, as relevant:      

the nature and realizable value of any collateral;        

call features, put features and other relevant terms of debt;        

the portfolio company s leverage and ability to make payments;        

the portfolio company s public or private credit rating;        

the portfolio company s actual and expected earnings and discounted cash flow;    
      74  

Table of Contents  

prevailing interest rates and spreads for similar securities and expected volatility in future interest rates;        

the markets in which the portfolio company does business and recent economic and/or market events; and        

comparisons to comparable transactions and publicly traded securities.      Investment performance
data utilized are the most recently available financial statements and compliance certificates received from the portfolio companies as of the measurement date which in many cases may reflect a lag in information.  
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value
of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the
investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material.    In addition, changes in the market environment
and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the realized gains or losses on investments to be different from the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation currently reflected in the consolidated financial
statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    US GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which ranks the
level of observability of market price inputs used in measuring investments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment and state
of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Investments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally have a
higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.    Investments measured and
reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in determination of fair values, as follows:      

Level I inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The types of financial instruments in Level I generally include
unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact
the quoted price.        

Level II inputs to the valuation methodology are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date and are those other than quoted prices in active markets. The type of financial instruments in this
category generally includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on
observable inputs.        

Level III inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or
estimation. Financial instruments that are in this category generally include investments in privately-held entities, collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs ), and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on
unobservable inputs.      In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair
value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Investment Adviser s assessment of the significance
of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment.  
      75  

Table of Contents  

  Transfer between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the
transfers occur.    The Company generally uses the following framework when determining the fair value of investments that are categorized
as Level III:    Investments in debt securities are initially evaluated to determine whether the enterprise value of the portfolio company
is greater than the applicable debt. The enterprise value of the portfolio company is estimated using a market approach and an income approach. The market approach utilizes market value (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and
available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The Company carefully considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose multiples are used to value its portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not
limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. The income approach typically uses a discounted cash flow analysis of the portfolio
company.    Investments in debt securities that do not have sufficient coverage through the enterprise value analysis are valued based on an
expected probability of default and discount recovery analysis.    Investments in debt securities with sufficient coverage through the
enterprise value analysis are generally valued using a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying security. Projected cash flows in the discounted cash flow typically represent the relevant security s contractual interest, fees and
principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the security s expected maturity date. The discount rate to be used is determined using an average of two market-based methodologies. Investments in debt securities may also
be valued using consensus pricing.    Investments in structured finance obligations are generally valued using a discounted cash flow and/or
consensus pricing.    Investments in equities are generally valued using a market approach and/or an income approach. The market approach
utilizes EBITDA multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The income approach typically uses a discounted cash flow analysis of the portfolio company.  
 Investments in the investment fund s subordinated loan and member s interest are valued using the net asset value of the
Company s ownership interest in the funds and investments in the investment fund s mezzanine loans are valued using the expected repayment rate.  
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investments in first and second lien debt
securities are discount rates and indicative quotes. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Significant decreases in indicative quotes in isolation may result in a significantly lower
fair value measurement.    The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investments in
structured finance obligations are discount rates, default rates, prepayment rates, recovery rates and indicative quotes. Significant increases in discount rates, default rates or prepayment rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower
fair value measurement, while a significant increase in recovery rates in isolation would result in a significantly higher fair value. Significant decreases in indicative quotes in isolation may result in a significantly lower fair value
measurement.    The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investments in equities are
discount rates and comparable EBITDA multiples. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Significant decreases in comparable EBITDA multiples would result in a significantly lower fair
value measurement.  
      76

  The carrying values of the secured borrowings and 2015-1 Notes approximate their respective fair
values and are categorized as Level III within the hierarchy. Secured borrowings are valued generally using discounted cash flow analysis. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s secured
borrowings are discount rates. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. The fair value determination of the Company s 2015-1 Notes was based on the market quotation(s) received from
broker/dealer(s). These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable and thus represent Level III measurements as defined in the accounting guidance for fair value measurement.  
 The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair value based on the short term nature of these items.  
 See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further information on fair value
measurements.      Use of Estimates    
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, in conformity with US GAAP
requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Management s estimates are based on historical experiences and other factors, including expectations of future events that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. It also requires
management to exercise judgment in the process of applying the Company s accounting policies. Assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of investments and their resulting impact on base management and incentive fees involve a higher
degree of judgment and complexity and these assumptions and estimates may be significant to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Actual results could differ from these estimates and such
differences could be material.      Investments    
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from
the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments charged off during the period,
net of recoveries. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q reflects the net change in the fair value of
investments, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.      Revenue
Recognition       Interest from Investments and Realized Gain/Loss on Investments   
 Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums. Discounts from and
premiums to par value on debt investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. The amortized cost of debt investments represents the original cost,
including origination fees, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, if any. At time of exit, the realized gain or loss on an investment is the difference between the amortized cost at time of exit and the cash received
at exit using the specific identification method.    The Company may have loans in its portfolio that contain payment-in-kind
( PIK ) provisions. PIK represents interest that is accrued and recorded as interest income at the contractual rates, increases the loan principal on the respective capitalization dates, and is generally due at maturity.  
      77  

Table of Contents  

  Interest income from investments in the  equity  class of CLO funds, which are included
in  structured finance obligations , is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows in accordance with ASC 325-40,  Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financials Assets .
We monitor the expected cash inflows from our CLO equity investments, including the expected residual payments and the effective yield is determined and updated at least quarterly. In estimating these cash flows, there are a number of assumptions
that are subject to uncertainties, including the amount and timing of principal payments which are impacted by prepayments, repurchases, defaults, delinquencies and liquidations of or within the CLO funds. These uncertainties are difficult to
predict and are subject to future events that could have impacted the Company s estimates if the information was known at the time. As a result, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.  
  Other Income     Other income may include
income such as consent, waiver, amendment, and syndication fees associated with the Company s investment activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered by the Company to portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized
as income when earned or the services are rendered. The Company may receive fees for guaranteeing the outstanding debt of a portfolio company. Such fees will be amortized into other income over the life of the guarantee. The unamortized amount, if
any, is included in other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.  
  Non-Accrual Income     Loans are generally
placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is
placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status
when past due principal and interest are paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of
collection.      Income Taxes      For
federal income tax purposes, GMS Finance has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code, and intends to make the required distributions to its stockholders as specified therein. In order to qualify as a RIC, GMS Finance must meet certain minimum
distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. If such requirements are met, then GMS Finance is generally required to pay income taxes only on the portion of its taxable income and gains it does not distribute.  
 The minimum distribution requirements applicable to RICs require GMS Finance to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its investment
company taxable income ( ICTI ), as defined by the Code, each year. Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, GMS Finance may choose to carry forward ICTI in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year. Any such
carryover ICTI must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such ICTI.  
 In addition, based on the excise distribution requirements, GMS Finance is subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed
income unless GMS Finance distributes in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of its ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year
period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by GMS Finance that is subject to
corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. GMS Finance intends to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the excise distribution requirements.  
      78  

Table of Contents  

  The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its
consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely than not  to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes, if any, are included in income
tax expense.    The Borrower Sub is a disregarded entity for tax purposes and is consolidated with the tax return of GMS Finance.  
   Capital Calls and Dividends and Distributions to Common Stockholders    
 The Company records the shares issued in connection with capital calls as of the effective date of the capital call. To the extent that the
Company has taxable income available, the Company intends to make quarterly distributions to its common stockholders. Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount to be distributed is determined by
the Board of Directors each quarter and is generally based upon the taxable earnings estimated by management and available cash. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed at least annually, although the Company may decide to
retain such capital gains for investment.    The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any
distributions on behalf of its stockholders, for those who have elected to participate in the plan. As a result of adopting such a plan, if the Board of Directors authorizes, and GMS Finance declares, a cash dividend or distribution, the
stockholders who have elected to participate in the dividend reinvestment plan would have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock, rather than receiving cash. Prior to a
Qualified IPO, the Company intends to use primarily newly issued shares of its common stock to implement the plan issued at the net asset value per share most recently determined by the Board of Directors. After a Qualified IPO, the Company intends
to use primarily newly issued shares to implement the plan so long as the market value per share is equal to or greater than the net asset value per share as of the close of business on the relevant payment date for such dividend or distribution. If
the market value per share is less than the net asset value per share as of the close of business on the relevant payment date, the plan administrator would purchase the common stock on behalf of participants in the open market, unless the Company
instructs the plan administrator otherwise.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in the valuations of our investment portfolio and interest rates.  
   Valuation Risk      Our investments
may not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good
faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. Due to
the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of
valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is possible that the difference could be material.  
   Interest Rate Risk      As of
September 30, 2016, on a fair value basis, approximately 1% of our debt investments bear interest at a fixed rate and approximately 99% of our debt investments bear interest at a floating rate, which primarily are subject to interest rate floors.
Interest rates on the investments held within the Company s portfolio of investments are typically based on floating LIBOR, with many of these investments also having a LIBOR floor. Additionally, the Company s credit facilities are also
subject to floating interest rates and are currently paid based on floating LIBOR rates.

  Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the
level of interest rates. There can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our income in the future.  
 The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income, should interest rates increase or
decrease by 100, 200 or 300 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from the Company s settled portfolio of investments held as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, excluding structured finance
obligations and investment fund. These hypothetical calculations are based on a model of the settled investments in our portfolio, excluding structured finance obligations and investment fund, held as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and
are only adjusted for assumed changes in the underlying base interest rates and the impact of that change on interest income. Interest expense is calculated based on outstanding secured borrowings and 2015-1 Notes as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 and based on the terms of the Company s credit facilities and 2015-1 Notes. Interest expense on the Company s credit facilities is calculated using the interest rate as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
adjusted for the hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. We intend to continue to finance a portion of our investments with borrowings and the interest rates paid on our borrowings may impact significantly our net interest income.  
 The Company regularly measures exposure to interest rate risk. The Company assesses interest rate risk and manages interest rate exposure on
an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates.
   Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the following table shows
the annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates for our settled investments (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments), excluding structured finance obligations and investment fund, and
outstanding secured borrowings and 2015-1 Notes assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:      
      Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer have concluded that our current
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act.  
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

bankruptcy case.      One or more of our portfolio companies may be involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization or liquidation
proceedings. The reorganization of a company can involve substantial legal, professional and administrative costs to a lender and the borrower. It is subject to unpredictable and lengthy delays, and during the process a company s competitive
position may erode, key management may depart and a company may not be able to invest adequately. In some cases, the debtor company may not be able to reorganize and may be required to liquidate assets. The debt of companies in financial
reorganization will, in most cases, not pay current interest, may not accrue interest during reorganization and may be adversely affected by an erosion of the issuer s fundamental value. To the extent we and an affiliate both hold investments
in the same portfolio company that are of a different character, we may also face restrictions on our ability to become actively involved in the event that portfolio company becomes distressed as a result of the restrictions imposed on transactions
involving affiliates under the Investment Company Act. In such cases, we may be unable to exercise rights we may otherwise have to protect our interests as security holders in such portfolio company.  
   Our ability to extend financial commitments may be limited.    
 The SEC has proposed a new Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act that, if enacted in the form proposed, could adversely impact the way we
and other BDCs do business. In addition to imposing restrictions on the use of derivatives, the rule would generally limit our financial commitments to portfolio companies, together with our exposure to other transactions involving senior securities
entered into by us other than in reliance of the rule, to not more than 150 percent of our net asset value. We cannot assure you when or if the proposed rule will be adopted by the SEC, and if adopted, whether the final rule will constrain our
ability to extend financial commitments.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   
 Except as previously reported by the Company on Form 8-K, we did not sell any equity securities during the period covered in this report that
were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.       Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.   
 Not applicable.  
    Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.   
 Not applicable.

ARTICLE 4   
  COMPANY CAPITAL AND INTERESTS   
 Section 4.1.  Capital Commitments .  
 (a) Each Member has made an initial Capital Contribution of $1,000 in U.S. dollars to the Company (  Initial Capital
Contribution  ) and a Subsequent Contribution of $14,000,000 in U.S. dollars to the Company. Each Member agrees to make additional Subsequent Contributions to the Company up to the amount set forth on  Exhibit A  attached hereto in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each Subsequent Contribution shall be made from time to time within five (5) business days after the date of notice from the Administrative Agent (or any other Person with the power and authority to
call the Capital Commitments) specifying the amount then to be paid, or at such later date as may be specified in such notice, and the bank account of the Company to which such amount is then to be paid; provided that the capital call of any such
amount shall be subject to Board Approval. Capital Contributions shall be made by all Members pro rata based on their respective Capital Commitments; provided, in the event that one or more Member is considered a Defaulting Member, then such
Capital Contributions called by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall first be paid by such Defaulting Member until the Defaulting Member has satisfied all unpaid amounts due and owing to the Company, and all remaining amounts
shall then be paid by all Members pro rata based on their respective Capital Commitments. The Members agree that, within five (5) business days after the date of each notice from the Administrative Agent (or any other Person with the power and
authority to call the Capital Commitments) specifying the amount then to be paid or such later date as may be specified in such notice on which such amount is then to be paid, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Company shall undertake a
Qualifying JV Pledge Reduction in accordance with the LSA so that, following the effectiveness of such Qualifying JV Pledge Reduction, the aggregate amount of JV Capital Pledge Amount under the LSA will be reduced to no more than (x) the
aggregate amount of Capital Commitments of the Members,  minus  (y) the aggregate amount of Capital Commitments called to date. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Members promptly if the Administrative Agent (as defined in the LSA)
refuses to agree to effect a Qualifying JV Pledge Reduction and/or a Qualifying JV Pledge Release, as the case may be.    (b) Notwithstanding
anything else herein, at any time that CGMSF is a Pledge Defaulting Member and Credit Partners is a Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, (i) the Administrative Agent shall not call any Capital Contributions and (ii) Capital Contributions may be called by
the Board.    (c) Any call of Capital Contributions shall be called by delivering to each Member a notice, substantially in the form as set
forth on  Exhibit B  hereto.    (d) Capital Contributions which are not used for their intended purpose shall be returned to the Members
within ninety (90) days after the date of receipt by the Company of such Capital Contributions in the same proportion in which made, in which case such amount shall be added back to the unfunded Capital Commitments of the Members and may be recalled
by the Company as set forth in this Article 4.  
      17  

(e) A Member may suspend the Investment Period (and thus the Member s unfunded Capital
Commitment with respect thereto) immediately upon notice to the other Member following a Cause Event with respect to such other Member. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Member shall remain liable for such Member s unfunded Capital
Commitment for Valid Company Purposes set forth in clauses (ii) through (vi) thereof during any suspension of the Investment Period.    (f)
Following the end of the Investment Period or during the suspension of the Investment Period pursuant to Section 4.1(e), the Company shall not issue capital calls pursuant to this Section 4.1 except for Valid Company Purposes, and each Member shall
remain liable for such Member s unfunded Capital Commitment for Valid Company Purposes set forth in clauses (ii) through (vi) thereof during any suspension or termination of the Investment Period.  
 (g) Notwithstanding anything else herein, in the event a Capital Contribution is called for the purpose of repaying the Mezzanine Loan, Credit
Partners is under no obligation to fund such Capital Contribution unless CGMSF makes a concurrent Capital Contribution. Credit Partners  failure to pay in full its Capital Contribution pursuant to this Section 4.1(g) shall not by itself be
cause for any claim or action by CGMSF pursuant to the terms of Section 4.3 hereof.    Section 4.2.  Temporary Advances . A Member or
its Affiliates, with Board Approval, may make loans (  Temporary Advances  ) to temporarily fund obligations for Valid Company Purposes until Capital Contributions are made by the Members as set forth in Section 4.1. Such
Temporary Advances plus interest at the Temporary Advance Rate shall be returned from any Capital Contributions by the Members under Section 4.1, with any unreturned Temporary Advances plus interest at the Temporary Advance Rate paid in accordance
with Section 6.1.    Section 4.3. Defaulting Members.  
 (a) (x) Upon the failure of any Member (a   Defaulting Member  ) to pay in full any portion of such Member s Capital
Commitment within ten (10) days after written notice from the other Member (the   Default Date  ) that such payment is overdue, the other Member (so long as it is not a Defaulting Member) (a   Non-Defaulting Member  ),
in its sole discretion, shall have the right to pursue one or more of the following remedies on behalf of the Company if such failure has not been cured in full within such ten-day period; provided, that, in the case of CGMSF, CGMSF shall be
considered a  Defaulting Member  for purposes of this Agreement automatically if CGMSF fails to make such payment within ten (10) days following the date upon which such payment was due by all Members, and the  Default Date  for
CGMSF shall be considered the 11th day following the date upon which such payment was due, or (y) on the date that a Member becomes a Pledge Defaulting Member (the   Pledge Default Date  ), the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, in its
sole discretion, shall have the right to pursue one or more of the following remedies on behalf of the Company:    (i)
collect such unpaid portion (and all attorneys  fees and other costs incident thereto) by exercising and/or pursuing any legal remedy the Company may have;  
      18  

(ii) upon thirty (30) days  written notice to the Defaulting Member or the
Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable (which period may commence during the ten (10) day notice period provided above in the case of the Defaulting Member), and provided that the overdue payment has not been made, dissolve and wind down the
Company in accordance with Article 9 as long as such action is not prohibited by Section 9.2(b); and    (iii) upon thirty
(30) days  written notice to the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable (which period may commence during the ten (10) day notice period provided above in the case of the Defaulting Member) and if such failure has not
been cured in full within such thirty (30) day period, compel the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, to sell or transfer all or a portion of its Membership Interest in whole or in part subject to the following:  
 (A) If the other Member notifies the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, to sell or transfer all
or a part of its Membership Interest, such Defaulting Member or Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, shall do so within sixty (60) days after the expiration of such thirty (30) day period.  
 (B) Upon any failure of the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, under any circumstances, to sell
or transfer all of its Membership Interests that are required to be sold within such sixty (60) day period, the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, may purchase such Membership Interest or sell or transfer such
Membership Interest to a third party or, subject to applicable law, to an Affiliate of a Member or the Company. The price for such sale or transfer shall be the lower of (x) the cost of such Membership Interests, and (y) the fair market value
of such Membership Interests, as determined by an investment bank selected by the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, for a hypothetical sale of such Membership Interest to an unaffiliated third party willing to
purchase such Membership Interest within a ninety (90) day time period; provided, however, that if no such buyer is found within such ninety (90) day period to purchase the Membership Interest of the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting
Member, as applicable, at such price or a higher price, then the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, may direct the sale or transfer of the Membership Interest of the Defaulting Member or the Pledge
Defaulting Member, as applicable, at a price and subject to such terms and conditions as it deems commercially reasonable in its good faith judgment and sole discretion, which terms and conditions may include the acceptance by the Defaulting Member
or the Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, of a promissory note issued by the purchaser thereof.    (C) To the extent
any amounts are owed by a Defaulting Member to a non-Defaulting Member or by a Pledge Defaulting Member to a Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, with respect to a Default Loan, any purchase price that would otherwise be payable to the
Defaulting Member or  
      19  

the Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, under this Section 4.3(a)(iii) shall instead first be paid to the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, pursuant
to the terms of Section 4.3(b)(iii) hereof, until each such Default Loan (and any accrued interest thereon) has been repaid in full with the remainder of such purchase price, if any, payable to the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting Member,
as applicable.    Except as set forth below, the election of the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, to pursue any one
of such remedies shall not be deemed to preclude such Member from pursuing any other such remedy, or any other available remedy, simultaneously or subsequently.  
 (b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,  
 (i) a Defaulting Member or a Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, shall not be entitled to distributions made after the
Default Date or the Pledge Default Date, as applicable, until the default is cured and any such distributions to which such Defaulting Member or Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, would otherwise have been entitled if such default had not
occurred shall be debited against the Capital Account of the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, so as to reduce the remaining amount of the default;  
 (ii) the Company shall not make new Investments after the Default Date or the Pledge Default Date, as applicable, until the
default is cured except as permitted pursuant to clauses (ii) through (vi) of Valid Company Purposes; and    (iii) the
Non-Defaulting Member, in its or their sole discretion, may fund all or any portion of the defaulted amount on behalf of the Defaulting Member with notice to the Board and to the other Members. The Members agree and acknowledge that any amount
so funded by the Non-Defaulting Member shall be treated as a loan from the Non-Defaulting Member to the Defaulting Member (a   Default Loan  ), the proceeds of which are used by the Defaulting Member to make a Capital Contribution to
the Company which, if in a sufficient amount, may cure a related default by such Defaulting Member. A Default Loan shall (A) bear interest from the date of such funding until repaid by the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting Member, as
applicable, at a rate equal to 20% per annum, (B) be pre-payable by the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, at any time and (C) be fully recourse to the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting Member, as
applicable. Until such time that there is no outstanding balance owed under any Default Loan (including any accrued interest thereon), (x) any amounts that would otherwise be distributable to the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting
Member, as applicable, under Section 6.1(b) hereof shall instead be distributed to the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, and (y) any purchase price payable to the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting
Member, as applicable, in connection with any sale of its or their respective Membership Interests in the Company shall first be paid to the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, and in each case of (x) and (y),
as repayment of the Default Loan(s) until the repayment in full of  
      20  

such Default Loan(s) (including any accrued interest thereon) proportionate to the amount of Default Loan(s) so extended by the Non-Defaulting Member to such Defaulting Member or by the Pledge
Non-Defaulting Member to such Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable. Any amounts distributed to the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, pursuant to the previous sentence shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement and for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes as having been made by the Company to the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, notwithstanding the Company s distribution of such amounts
to the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, and any amounts distributed or payable to the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, pursuant to the previous sentence shall reduce
the amounts owed to the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, under the related Default Loan, first as to interest and then as to principal.  
 (iv) In the event that (I) the Collateral Agent calls capital from a Member pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, (II) one Member
pays in full all of such capital call (the   Pledge Non-Defaulting Member  ) and (III) the other Member either (x) fails to pay in full all or any portion of a concurrent call of capital by the Collateral Agent or (y) was not
required by the Collateral Agent to make a concurrent Capital Contribution (in either case, a   Pledge Defaulting Member  ), then at the sole election of the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, the Pledge Agreement Shortfall Amount shall be
treated as a Default Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing:    (A) if the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member does not elect to treat
such called capital as a Default Loan within five (5) days of paying the Pledge Agreement Shortfall Amount, then additional Membership Interests in the Company will be issued to the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member such that each Member s
percentage ownership of the Company is equal to the aggregate Capital Contributions made by such Member  divided  by the aggregate Capital Contributions made by both Members; and  
 (B) if the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member is Credit Partners, and Credit Partners does not elect to treat such called capital as
a Default Loan within five (5) days of paying the Pledge Agreement Shortfall Amount, then:    (1) (x) the interest earned on

satisfied (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the adjusted tax basis of the assets securing such liability), and the net assets of the Company were distributed immediately after such allocation.  
 Section 5.3.  Special Allocations . Notwithstanding any of the provisions set forth above to the contrary, the following special
allocations shall be made in the following order:    (a)  Minimum Gain Chargeback . If there is a net decrease in the Company

in the Company Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation   1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Member
pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations   1.704-2(f)(6) and   1.704-2(j)(2). This Section 5.3(a) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback
requirement in Treasury Regulation   1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.    (b)  Member Minimum Gain
Chargeback . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 5, if there is a net decrease in Member Minimum Gain attributable to Member Nonrecourse Debt during any Fiscal Year, each Member which has a share of the Member Minimum Gain
attributable to such Member Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations   1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated items of the Company income and gain for such Fiscal Year (and, if necessary, subsequent Fiscal

previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Member pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations   1.704-2(i)(4)

 (c)  Qualified Income Offset . In the event that any Member unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions
described in Treasury Regulations   1.704 1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6), items of the Company income and gain shall be specifically allocated to each such Member in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by
 
      24  

the Treasury Regulations, the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of such Member as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 5.3(c) shall be made if and only to the
extent that such Member would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided for in this Article 5 have been tentatively made as if this Section 5.3(c) were not applicable. The foregoing provision is intended to
comply with Treasury Regulations   1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Treasury Regulations.  
 (d)  Gross Income Allocation . In the event that any Member has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of any Fiscal Year,
then each such Member shall be specially allocated items of the Company income and gain as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have an
Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided for in this Article 5 have been tentatively made as if Section 5.3(c) and this Section 5.3(d) were not applicable.  
 (e)  Nonrecourse Deductions . Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year will be allocated to the Members in the same manner in which
such items would have been allocated pursuant to Section 5.2.    (f)  Member Nonrecourse Deductions . Any Member Nonrecourse
Deductions for any Fiscal Year or other period shall be specially allocated to the Member who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the Member Nonrecourse Debt to which such Member Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with
Treasury Regulations   1.704-2(i).    (g)  Code Section 754 Adjustment . To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis
of any the Company asset pursuant to Code Section 734(b) or Code Section 743(b) is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation   1.704 1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as the result of a distribution to a
Member in complete liquidation of its interest in the Company, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such
basis) and such gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Members in a manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant to such Treasury Regulations Section.  
 (h)  Tax Allocations . Subject to Section 704(c) of the Code, for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, all items of the
Company income, gain, loss, deduction, credit and any other allocations not otherwise provided for shall be allocated among the Members in the same manner as the corresponding item of income, gain, loss or deduction was allocated pursuant to the
preceding paragraphs of this Article 5.    (i)  Section 704(c) Allocations . In accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the Company, or any property owned by the Company at the time of any revaluation of the Company s assets pursuant to
Section 5.1(c), shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Members so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted tax basis of such property to the Company for federal income tax purposes and its

fair market value at the time of contribution or revaluation. Allocations pursuant to this Section 5.3(i)
are solely for purposes of federal, state and local taxes and shall not affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any Member s Capital Account or share of Profit, Loss or other items or distributions

between any permitted transferor and transferee of a Membership Interest, or between any Members whose relative Membership Interests have changed during such period, or to any withdrawing Member that is no longer a Member in the Company, the Company
shall allocate according to any method allowed by the Code and selected by Board Approval. Distributions with respect to a Membership Interest in the Company shall be payable to the owner of such Membership Interest on the date of distribution
subject to the provisions of this Agreement. For purposes of determining the Profit or Loss allocable to or the distributions payable to a permitted transferee of a Membership Interest in the Company or to a Member whose Membership Interest has

transferee or other holder.    Section 5.5.  Income Taxes and Tax Capital Accounts . Each item of income, gain, loss, deduction or

the amount of any such distribution may be reduced as provided by Section 6.2 and Section 6.3, including, without limitation, for the purpose of reinvesting proceeds received from Investments as set forth in Section 6.3. Available cash and cash

distribution shall be shared among the Members as follows:  
      26

thereon;    (ii) Second, to the Members in respect of any accrued and unpaid interest on their Member Loans in proportion to

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, to the extent any amounts are owed by a Defaulting Member to a Non-Defaulting
Member or by a Pledge Defaulting Member to a Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, with respect to a Default Loan, any amounts that would otherwise be distributable to the Defaulting Member or the Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable,
under Sections 6.1(b)(ii), (iii) or (iv) shall instead be distributed to the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of Section 4.3(b)(iii).

withholding or other tax, including, without limitation, any interest, penalties or additions with respect thereto, imposed on any interest or income of or distributions to such Member, and such withheld amount shall be considered an interest
payment or other distribution, as the case may be, to such Member for purposes hereof. If no payment is then being made to such Member in an amount sufficient to pay the Company s withholding obligation, any amount which the Company is
obligated to pay shall be deemed an interest-free advance from the Company to such Member, payable by such Member by withholding from subsequent distributions or within ten (10) days after receiving written request for payment from the Company.  
 (b) If a Member delivers to the Company a properly executed withholding tax exemption certificate (or such other form as the Internal Revenue
Service or the applicable foreign or state taxing authority may require) providing for a complete exemption from withholding tax, the Company shall not withhold from distributions (or with respect to such allocations) covered by such exemption
certificate.

the foregoing provisions:   (a) The Company may withhold from any distribution a reasonable reserve which the Members, with Board Approval,
determine to be appropriate for working capital of the Company or to discharge costs, Expenses and liabilities of the Company (whether or not accrued or contingent), or otherwise to be in the best interests of the Company for any Valid Company
Purpose. Any part or all of such reserved amount (  Reserved Amount  ) that is released from reserve (other than to make payments on account of a purpose for which the reserve was established) shall be distributed to the Members
in accordance with Section 6.1 and Section 6.2.    (b) During the Investment Period, amounts received by the Company with respect to the
payment of principal or return of capital may be retained and used, or reserved to be used, to make any Investment.    (c) In no event shall
the Company be required to make a distribution to the extent that it would (i) render the Company insolvent, or (ii) violate Section 18-607(a) of the Act.  
 (d) No part of any distribution shall be paid to any Member from which there is due and owing to the Company, at the time of such distribution,
any amount required to be paid to the Company pursuant to Article 4. Any such withheld distribution shall (i) be paid to such Member, without interest, when all past due installments of such Member s Capital Commitment have been paid in
full by such Member or (ii) be applied against the past due amounts under such Member s Capital Commitment.    (e) The Company shall not
distribute Illiquid Securities other than with Board Approval. Distributions of securities and of other non-cash assets of the Company other than upon the dissolution and liquidation of the Company shall only be made pro rata to all Members (in
proportion to their respective shares of the total distribution) with respect to each security or other such asset distributed. Securities listed on a national securities exchange that are not restricted as to transferability and unlisted
securities for which an active trading market exists and that are not restricted as to transferability shall be valued in the manner contemplated by Section 10.5 as of the close of business on the day preceding the distribution, and all other

shall not be deemed to limit the liabilities and obligations of such Person to seek Board Approval as set forth in this Agreement.  
 Section 7.17.  Members      Outside Transactions; Investment Opportunities; Time and Attention .  
 (a) Board Members, Investment Committee Members and officers shall devote such time as he or she determines in his or her sole discretion is

dissimilar mandates, and may be subject to the provisions of the Investment Company Act, including, without limitation, Section 57 thereof, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules, regulations and interpretations thereof,
with respect to the allocation of investment opportunities among such other investment funds and other accounts (the   Allocation Requirements  ). Except for any Allocation Requirement that may be applicable to the Company, a
Member shall not be  
      34  

obligated to offer any Investment opportunity, or portion thereof, to the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, and subject to Section 7.17(e), during the
Investment Period, CGMSF and its Affiliates that are controlled, managed or advised by CGMSIM agree to refer all investment opportunities that are Qualified Investments to the Company.  
 (c) Subject to the provisions of this Section 7.17 and other provisions of this Agreement, each of the Members, Board Members, officers and
each of their respective Affiliates and their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents may engage in, invest in, participate in or otherwise enter into other business ventures of any kind,
nature and description, individually and with others, including, without limitation, the formation and management of other investment funds with or without the same or similar purposes as the Company, and the ownership of and investment in assets,
and neither the Company nor any other Member shall have any right in or to any such activities or the income or profits derived therefrom. In connection therewith, subject to the provisions of Section 7.17(e) and other provisions of this
Agreement, it is expressly agreed that in no event shall it be considered a violation of this Agreement (whether under Section 7.17(a) with respect to time devotion or under any other section herein with respect to investment allocations or
otherwise) for a Member or any of its Affiliates or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees and agents to continue to engage in such investments and transactions nor shall the provisions of this
Agreement in any way limit or prohibit any future investments or transactions by a Member or any of its Affiliates (or any of their investment managers or sponsors) or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors, officers,
employees and agents directly or with third parties or in any way constrain the ability of a Member or any of its Affiliates (or any of their investment managers or sponsors) or their respective owners, principals, shareholders, members, directors,
officers, employees and agents to manage and invest their assets.   (d) For the avoidance of doubt, Credit Partners (or its Affiliates,
associated investment funds, portfolio companies or employees, as applicable) and their respective permitted transferees will have no duty (contractual or otherwise) to (1) communicate or present any Investment opportunities to the Company or (2)
refrain from pursuing, directly or indirectly, any Investment opportunities for itself, and directing any such opportunity to another Person; provided that Section 7.17(d)(2) shall not apply to, and Credit Partners and its Affiliates shall not
pursue or direct any Qualified Investment opportunity if such Qualified Investment opportunity was presented to the Investment Committee, unless (A) such Qualified Investment opportunity was first identified by or to Credit Partners or Affiliates of
Credit Partners independently of the personnel of CGMSF or CGMSIM (in which case Credit Partners shall notify the Investment Committee and CGMSF as soon as practicable), or (B) the Company fails to consummate such Qualified Investment opportunity
other than due to the action or inaction on the part of Credit Partners or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Credit Partners shall be permitted to direct or pursue Qualified Investment opportunities approved for the Company by the
Investment Committee with the prior approval of the Investment Committee. The Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its respective Affiliates, hereby renounces and waives any right to require Credit Partners (or its Affiliates, associated
investment funds, portfolio companies or employees, as applicable) and their permitted transferees to act in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 7.17(d). For purposes of the foregoing, (x) any external investment managers
 
      35  

with discretion or authorization who manages debt investments on behalf of Credit Partners or its Affiliates and (y) any other investment team within Credit Parent or its Affiliates (other than
the U.S. private debt employees of Credit Parent s Affiliates) will be excluded from the foregoing and any limitations contained therein, unless, in the case of (x) or (y), Credit Partners or any of its Affiliates acting on Credit Partners
behalf, shares any confidential information regarding the potential Investment opportunity with such investment team.    (e) Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.17 and other provisions of this Agreement, during the Investment Period, neither Carlyle Parent or its Affiliates may, without Credit Partners  prior written consent, enter into the formation and
management of any investment fund, investment vehicle or account that is primarily engaged in and principally marketed as having an investment mandate that substantially overlaps with Qualified Investments until at least 75% of Capital Commitments
have been contributed to the Company.    (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.17 and other provisions of this
Agreement, the Members agree that the Company and one or more of the Members may co-invest in investment opportunities where appropriate, subject to the approval of the board of directors of CGMSF and in accordance to the terms of this
Agreement; provided that, to the extent that the demand from the Members and the Company is higher than the total Investment opportunity available to the Members and the Company, such Investment opportunity shall be allocated in a manner such that
the Company will not receive a smaller allocation than any Member participating in such investment unless approved by the Investment Committee.  
 Section 7.18.  Indemnification .  
 (a) Subject to the limitations and conditions as provided in this Section 7.18, each Board Member and each Member and its employees, directors,
officers, owners, principals, shareholders, members, and partners who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or arbitrative or in the nature of an alternative dispute resolution in lieu of any of the foregoing (other than any of the foregoing between the two Members, hereinafter a   Proceeding  ), or any appeal
in such a Proceeding or any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such a Proceeding, by reason of the fact that such Person, is or was a Board Member, an officer or representative or agent of the Company, a Member or an employee, director,
officer, owner, principal, shareholder, member, or partner of a Member, shall be indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,
only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment) against all liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation,
judgments, penalties (including, without limitation, excise and similar taxes and punitive damages), losses, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  and experts  fees)) actually
incurred by such Person in connection with such Proceeding, appeal, inquiry or investigation (each a   Harm  ), unless such Harm shall have been primarily the result of gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct by the Person
seeking indemnification hereunder, in which case such indemnification shall not cover such Harm to the extent resulting from such gross  
      36  

negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct. Indemnification under this Section 7.18 shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to serve in the capacity which initially entitled such
Person to indemnity hereunder. The rights granted pursuant to this Section 7.18 shall be deemed contract rights, and no amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.18 shall have the effect of limiting or denying any such rights with
respect to actions taken or Proceedings, appeals, inquiries or investigations arising prior to any amendment, modification or repeal. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no individual entitled to indemnification under this shall be liable
to the Company or any Member for any act or omission performed or omitted by or on behalf of the Company; provided that such act or omission has not been fully adjudicated to constitute fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence. In
addition, any Person entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.18 may consult with legal counsel selected with reasonable care and shall incur no liability to the Company or any Member to the extent that such Person acted or refrained from
acting in good faith in reliance upon the opinion or advice of such counsel and such Person provided such counsel all material facts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not indemnify any Member or an employee, director, officer, owner,
principal, shareholder, member, or partner of a Member, in the event that the Proceeding involves a Member as the defendant and another Member as the respondent in such Proceeding.  
 (b) The right to indemnification conferred in Section 7.18(a) shall include the right to be paid or reimbursed by the Company for the
reasonable expenses incurred by a Person entitled to be indemnified under Section 7.18(a) who was, is or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a Proceeding in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding and without any
determination as to the Person s ultimate entitlement to indemnification; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by any such Person in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to
the Company of a written undertaking by such Person to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall be finally adjudicated that such indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 7.18 or otherwise; provided, further, that such
advancement of expenses by the Company shall not be made to such Person in the event that the Proceeding involves a Member as the defendant and another Member as the respondent in such Proceeding.  
 (c) The right to indemnification and the advancement and payment of expenses conferred in this Section 7.18 shall not be exclusive of any other
right that a Member or other Person indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.18 may have or hereafter acquire under any law (common or statutory), this Agreement, any contract of insurance or any other contract, arrangement or understanding.  
 (d) The indemnification rights provided by this Section 7.18 shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, successors,
and assigns of each Person indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.18.    Section 7.19.  Tax Matters Member . 
 (a) CGMSF shall be the   tax matters partner   of the Company within the meaning of Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code and shall
also the  partnership representative  within the meaning of Section 6223 of the New Partnership Audit Procedures (collectively, in such capacity, the   Tax Matters Member  ). The provisions of Section 7.18 shall apply
to all actions taken on behalf of the Members by the Tax Matters Member in its capacity as such. The Tax Matters Member shall have the right and obligation to take all actions authorized and required, respectively, by the Code for the tax
matters partner of the Company.  
      37  

(b) The Tax Matters Member shall, at all times, keep all Members informed as to any discussions
with any taxing administration with respect to any material tax issue concerning the Company or its subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, the Tax Matters Member shall provide notice to the other
Members promptly (and in any event, no later than 30 days) after it receives notice from any taxing authority of any pending or threatened examination, adjustment or proceeding relating to any tax items of the Company or its subsidiaries. The
Tax Matters Member shall (i) consult with the other Members with respect to the conduct of such examination or proceedings, or any court proceedings with respect to tax, (ii) afford the other Members a reasonable opportunity to participate in any
such examination, proceeding or court proceeding and any meeting (whether in person, phone or otherwise) with any taxing authority or appearance in court, and (iii) afford the other Members a reasonable opportunity to review drafts of any submission
to any taxing authority or court, including requests for administrative adjustments. Without the approval of other Members, the Tax Matters Member shall not take any action with respect to the conduct of any examination or proceeding and shall not
make any submission to any taxing authority or court if any Member has objected to such action. The Tax Matters Member shall not extend the statute of limitations or file a tax claim in any court without the approval of the other Members.
Additionally, the Tax Matters Member shall not submit any request for administrative adjustment on behalf of the Company without the approval of the other Members. The Tax Matters Member agrees that it will not bind any Member to any tax settlement
without the approval of such Member. Further, for the sake of clarity, the Tax Matters Member will take no action that affects another Member without the approval of such Member. The Tax Matters Member shall not take any action without
Prior Board Approval.    (c) The Tax Matters Member shall have the right to retain professional assistance in respect of any audit of the
Company and all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses and fees incurred by the Tax Matters Member on behalf of the Company as Tax Matters Member shall be reimbursed by the Company.     
 (d) Any election proposed to be made or action proposed to be taken by the Tax Matters Member pursuant to the New Partnership Audit Procedures
shall require the prior written consent of the other Members.    (e) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, wherever in this Agreement
the Tax Matters Member is empowered to make a decision or determination, take an action, consent, vote, or provide any approval, in doing so, the Tax Matters Member shall use its reasonable discretion, shall consult with all other Members and shall
take into account the concerns and tax objectives of such other Members.

ARTICLE 8   
  TRANSFERS OF COMPANY INTERESTS; WITHDRAWALS   
 Section 8.1.  Transfers by Members .  
 (a) Within a period of five (5) years after the Initial Closing Date, other than with respect to the sale and transfer of the Membership
Interest of a Defaulting Member or a Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, in accordance with Section 4.3, the Membership Interest of a Member may not be transferred or assigned without the prior written consent of the other Member and may not be
pledged or otherwise hypothecated without the prior written consent of the other Member; provided, however, that CGMSF may pledge and/or assign its Membership Interest to the senior credit facility provider(s) for CGMSF with notice to the other
Member within a reasonable time thereafter. After the expiration of such five (5) year period, the Membership Interest of a Member may not be assigned without first offering the other Member a right of first refusal to purchase the Membership
Interest as set forth in Section 8.1(f). Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written consent of the other Member or the offering of such right of first refusal, any Member may assign its entire Membership Interest to a wholly owned
Affiliate of such Member, if the assignor remains liable for its Capital Commitment. No assignment by a Member shall be binding upon the Company until the Company receives an executed copy of such assignment, which shall be in form and
substance satisfactory to the other Member, and any assignment pursuant to this Section 8.1(a) shall be subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(e).  
 (b) Any Person which acquires a Membership Interest by assignment in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be admitted as a
substitute Member only upon approval of the other Member. The admission of an assignee as a substitute Member shall be conditioned upon the assignee s written assumption, in form and substance satisfactory to the other Member, of all
obligations of the assignor in respect of the assigned Membership Interest and execution of an instrument satisfactory to the other Member whereby such assignee becomes a party to this Agreement.  
 (c) In the event any Member shall be adjudicated as bankrupt, or in the event of the winding up or liquidation of a Member, the legal
representative of such Member shall, upon written notice to the other Member of the happening of any of such events and satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(e), become an assignee of such Member s Membership Interest, subject
to all of the terms of this Agreement as then in effect.    (d) Any assignee of the Membership Interest of a Member, irrespective of whether
such assignee has accepted and adopted in writing the terms and provisions of this Agreement, shall be deemed by the acceptance of such assignment to have agreed to be subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the same manner as its
assignor.    (e) As additional conditions to the validity of any assignment of a Member s Membership Interest, such assignment shall
not:  
      39  

(i) cause the securities issued by the Company to be required to be registered
under the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any applicable jurisdiction;  
 (ii) cause the Company to cease to be entitled to the exemption from the definition of an  investment company 
pursuant to Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder;    (iii)
result in the Company being classified as a  publicly traded partnership  under the Code;    (iv) unless the other
Member waives in writing the application of this clause (iv) with respect to such assignment (which the other Member may refuse to do in its absolute discretion), be to a Person which is an ERISA Plan;  
 (v) adversely impact CGMSF s treatment of its investment in the Company for purposes of the Investment Company Act or for
financial reporting purposes; or    (vi) cause the Company or the other Member to be in violation of, or effect an assignment
to a Person that is in violation of, applicable Investor Laws.    The non-assigning Member may require reasonable evidence as to the
foregoing, including, without limitation, an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the non-assigning member. Any purported assignment as to which the conditions set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi) are not satisfied shall
be void ab initio. An assigning Member shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by the Company, including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses, in connection with any assignment or proposed assignment.  
 (f) Except for assignments under the third sentence or the proviso of the first sentence of Section 8.1(a) or with respect to sales or
transfers pursuant to Section 4.3, each Member hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the other Member or its designee a right of first refusal to purchase all, but not less than all, of any Membership Interest in the Company that such
assigning Member may propose to assign to another Person, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those offered to the prospective assignee. Each Member proposing to make an assignment that is subject to this Section 8.1(f)
must deliver a notice to the other Member not later than sixty (60) days prior to the proposed closing date of such assignment. Such notice shall contain the material terms and conditions (including, without limitation, price and form of
consideration) of the proposed assignment and the identity of the prospective assignee. To exercise its right of first refusal under this Section 8.1(f), the other Member must deliver a notice to the selling Member within forty-five (45) days
of receipt of such notice, stating that it elects to exercise its right of first refusal and, if applicable, providing the identity of any Person that the non-assigning Member designates as the purchaser.  
 (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Member acknowledges and agrees that in the event such Member is entitled
to transfer its Membership Interest from the Company, prior to the effectiveness of such transfer, such Member shall be obligated to fund such Capital Contributions as may be required under the terms of the Facility as a result of such transfer;
provided, that in no event shall any amounts funded by such Member exceed its uncalled Capital Commitment.  
      40  

Section 8.2.  Withdrawal by Members .  
 Members may withdraw from the Company only as provided by this Agreement.  
 (a) Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, if a Member shall obtain an opinion of counsel to the effect that, as a
result of the other Member s ownership of a Membership Interest in the Company, the Company would be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, such other Member shall, upon written notice from such first
Member, withdraw from or reduce (in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.2(c) below) its Membership Interest in the Company (including its Capital Commitment) to the extent such first Member has determined, based upon such opinion of counsel,
to be necessary in order for the Company not to be required to so register. Each Member shall, upon written request from the other Member, promptly furnish to the other Member such information as the other Member may reasonably request from
time to time in order to make a determination pursuant to this Section 8.2(a), but in no event later than ten (10) business days after such request.  
 (b) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if a Member shall violate the United States Bank Secrecy Act, the United States Money
Laundering Act of 1986, the United States International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti- Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, the USA Patriot Act or any other law or regulation to which the Company, a Member, or such Member s investment in the
Company may be subject from time to time (collectively,   Investor Laws  ), or if the other Member shall obtain an opinion of counsel to the effect that any contribution or payment by a Member to the Company would cause the Company or
the other Member to be in violation of, or to the effect that such Member is in violation of, any of the Investor Laws, such Member shall, upon written notice from the other Member, withdraw from the Company in accordance with the provisions of
Section 8.2(c) below. Each Member shall, upon written request from the other Member, promptly furnish to the other Member such information as the other Member may reasonably request from time to time in order to make a determination pursuant to
this Section 8.2(b), but in no event later than ten (10) business days after such request.    (c) If a Member partially withdraws its
Membership Interest in the Company pursuant to this Section 8.2, it shall receive, in full payment for such withdrawn Membership Interest from first cash and cash equivalents available for distribution pursuant to Article 6 (and subject to the
proviso in Section 6.1(b) if then applicable to such Member as the obligor with respect to an outstanding Default Loan), the sum of the portion of the Capital Account attributable to such withdrawn Membership Interest (adjusted to reflect the Value
of the Company as determined as of the date of the last valuation pursuant to Section 10.5 and taking into account all Capital Contributions contributed by such Member to the Company with respect to a Subscription Facility pursuant to Section
8.2(d)). If a Member withdraws its entire Membership Interest in the Company pursuant to this Section 8.2, then, subject to Section 9.2(b), the Company shall dissolve as provided by Article 9.  
      41  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Member acknowledges and
agrees that in the event such Member is entitled to withdraw its Membership Interest from the Company, prior to the effectiveness of such withdrawal, such Member shall be obligated to fund such Capital Contributions as may be required under the
terms of a Subscription Facility as a result of such withdrawal (taking into account all Capital Contributions already contributed by such Member to the Company with respect to the Subscription Facility); provided, that in no event shall any amounts
funded by such Member exceed its uncalled Capital Commitment.     ARTICLE 9

9.2(a)(iii) to Section 9.2(a)(vi), the Member that elects such dissolution and winding up may elect further (subject to all of the provisions of this Agreement), by written notice to the other Member, to exercise as liquidating agent all of the
rights, powers and authority with respect to the assets and liabilities of the Company in connection with the liquidation of the Company, to the same extent as the Members would have during the term of the Company.  
 (b) From and after the date on which an event set forth in Section 9.2(a) becomes effective, the Company shall cease to make Investments after
that date, except for Investments permitted pursuant to clauses (ii) through (vi) of Valid Company Purposes. Capital calls against the Capital Commitment of the Members shall cease from and after such effective date; provided that capital calls

distributions in-kind, the assets to be distributed will be valued at fair value.    (d) Upon dissolution of the Company, final allocations
of all items of Company Profit and Loss shall be made in accordance with Section 5.2. Upon dissolution of the Company, the assets of the Company shall be applied in the following order of priority:

Company (whether by payment or by the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof), including, without limitation, to establish any reasonable reserves which the Board may, in its reasonable judgment, deem necessary or advisable for any
contingent, conditional or unmatured liability of the Company and to establish any reasonable reserves with respect to amounts the Company may pay or contribute in connection with Financing Subsidiaries;

conditional or unmatured liability of the Company to Members; and    (iii) The balance, if any, to the Members in accordance
with Section 6.1(b).    (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of an event described in any of Section 9.2(a)(iii) to Section
9.2(a)(vi), the Member that may elect a dissolution and winding up may elect alternatively, by written notice to the other Member, to purchase all of the other Member s Membership Interest in the Company. Other than in connection with a
sale or transfer of the Membership Interest of a Defaulting Member or a Pledge Defaulting Member, as applicable, pursuant to Section 4.3, the purchase price for such Membership Interest shall be payable in cash within ninety (90) days after the
election to purchase is delivered to the other Member, and shall be equal to the Capital Account of the other Member adjusted to reflect the Value of the Company as determined as of the date of the last valuation pursuant to Section 10.5;
provided, however, that to the extent any amounts are owed by the other Member to a Non-Defaulting Member or a Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, with respect to a Default Loan, any purchase price that would otherwise be payable to such
other Member under this section shall instead first be paid to the Non-Defaulting Member or the Pledge Non-Defaulting Member, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of Section 4.3(b)(iii) hereof, until each such Default Loan (and any interest thereon)
has been repaid in full with the remainder thereof, if any, payable to such other Member. After such purchase, the other Member shall no longer be a member of the Company, and the Member that has elected to purchase the other Member s
Membership Interest may dissolve or continue the Company as it may determine.    (f) In the event that an audit or reconciliation relating to
the fiscal year in which a Member receives a distribution under this Section 9.3 reveals that such Member received a distribution in excess of that to which such Member was entitled, the Company or the other Member may, in its discretion, seek
repayment of such distribution to the extent that such distribution exceeded what was due to such Member.    (g) Each Member shall be
furnished with a statement prepared by the Company s accountant, which shall set forth the assets and liabilities of the Company as at the date of complete liquidation, and each Member s share thereof. Upon compliance with the
distribution plan set forth in this Section 9.3, the Members shall cease to be such, and either Member may execute, acknowledge and cause to be filed a certificate of cancellation of the Company.

   FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Middle Market Credit Fund, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
  Company  ), does hereby promise to pay to [INSERT NAME OF MEMBER], a [INSERT TYPE OF ENTITY] (the   Payee  ), or its order, at its offices in New York, New York, or such other address as may be duly designated by the
holder of this Note, [ ] ($[ ]), or if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all advances made by the Payee to the undersigned hereunder, with interest thereon as set forth herein. The initial advance, all subsequent advances
and all payments made on account of principal shall be endorsed by the holder on the attached schedule to this Note. The principal amount of the loan together with any interest thereon shall be payable on the Maturity Date (as defined below).
     Business Day   means a day upon which banks in New York City are not authorized or required by law to be closed.  
 1. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Company s Amended and Restated Limited Liability
Company Agreement (the   LLC Agreement  ), dated as of February 29, 2016, as amended from time to time.    2. The Payee agrees
that from time to time during the term of this Note it shall lend to the Company, subject to the terms of the LLC Agreement and the terms of this Note, sums which, in the aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time, shall not exceed
$             (the   Credit  ), and the Company agrees to borrow said sum from Payee upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.  
 3. The Credit shall be a revolving credit and the Company may, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 5 and 6 below governing prepayments and
repayments and the terms of the LLC Agreement, request advances, repay and reborrow amounts during the continuation of this Note, subject to the terms of this Note and the LLC Agreement. Each revolving credit loan hereunder (an
  Advance  ) shall have a scheduled maturity date of [ ], [ ], unless an earlier date is listed on the Schedule attached hereto (such date, the   Maturity Date  ) and made a part hereof (the
  Schedule  ). No Advance shall be made on or after [ ], [ ]. All Advances shall be noted on the Schedule. Payee shall, and is hereby authorized by the Company to, endorse on the Schedule, or on a continuation
of such Schedule attached hereto and made a part thereof and hereof, appropriate notations regarding the Advances; provided, however, that the failure to make, or error in making, any such notation shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations
of the Company hereunder.    4. Interest due on this Note shall be 0.001% per annum, calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual
number of days elapsed prior to the Maturity Date and shall be compounded monthly. 
      D-1  

5. This Note evidences loan made to the Company by Payee and shall be treated as a Capital
Contribution for purposes of Article 4 of the LLC Agreement and Member Loan. This Note may be prepaid at any time by the Company in whole or in part at the election of the Company, in an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount thereof
plus accrued interest, subject to the provisions of paragraph 6.    6. (a) Payee, for itself and its successors and assigns, covenants and
agrees that the obligation of the Company to make any payment on account of the principal of and interest on any Advance shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Company s obligations to the holders of Senior Indebtedness.
   (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on any Senior Indebtedness beyond any applicable grace period, or in the event that any event of default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness shall have occurred and be continuing, or would occur as a result of the payment referred to
hereinafter, permitting the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of the holders thereof) to accelerate the maturity thereof, then, unless and until such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived or shall have
ceased to exist, no payment of principal of or interest on the Advances shall be made by the Company.    (c) Subject to the
provisions of this paragraph 6, nothing contained in this paragraph 6 is intended to or shall impair, as between Payee and the Company, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to Payee the principal of and interest
on the Advances when, where and as the same shall become due and payable, all in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of Payee and creditors of the Company other than the holders of
Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent Payee from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Agreement, subject to the rights, if any, under this paragraph 6 of the holders of
Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy.  
 (d) No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at
any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants
of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof with which any such holder may have or be otherwise charged. The holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time or from time to time and in their absolute discretion, change the manner, place
or terms of payment, change or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, any such Senior Indebtedness, or amend or supplement any instrument pursuant to which any such Senior Indebtedness is issued or by which it may be secured, or release
any security therefor, or exercise or refrain from exercising any other of their rights under the Senior Indebtedness including, without limitation, the waiver of default thereunder, all without notice to or assent from Payee and without affecting
the obligations of the Company or Payee under this paragraph 6.  
      D-2  

(e) Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, Payee shall be
subrogated to the rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of assets of the Company applicable to such Senior Indebtedness until the Advances shall be paid in full, and none of the payments or
distributions to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to which Payee would be entitled except for the provisions of this paragraph 6 or of payments over, pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph 6, to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness
by Payee shall, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, and Payee, be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or on account of such Senior Indebtedness; it being understood that the provisions of
this paragraph 6 are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of Payee, on one hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.  
 (f)   Senior Indebtedness   means any and all indebtedness or liabilities of the Company other than the Advances
and indebtedness and liabilities of the Company that are expressly of equal priority to the Advances.   7. The Payee hereby authorizes the
Company to make any and all distributions that would otherwise be payable by the Company pursuant to Articles 6 of the LLC Agreement directly to the Payee and any other Members that have made Member Loans to the Company (to be split among them
 pro rata  in accordance with the relative amounts of such Member Loans to the Company) until such time as the obligations evidenced by this Note have been paid in full.  
 8. If the Company fails to repay this Note on the Maturity Date, the Company shall reimburse the holder of this Note for all of its costs and
expenses incurred in enforcing this Note, including reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall be recourse only to the Company s Interest in the Company.  
 9. This Note may be discharged, terminated, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified only by an instrument in writing signed by the party
against which enforcement of such discharge, termination or modification is sought.    10. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Company hereby waives diligence, presentment, protest and demand, notice of protest, dishonor and nonpayment of this Note and expressly agrees that, without in any way affecting the liability of the Company hereunder, the holder hereof may extend
the time for payment of any amount due hereunder, accept additional security, release any party liable hereunder or any security now or hereafter securing this Note, without in any other way affecting the liability and obligation of the Company or
any other person.    11. No failure by the holder hereof to insist upon the strict performance of any term hereof or to exercise any right,
power or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof will constitute a waiver of any such term or of any such breach. No waiver of any breach will affect or alter this Note, which will continue in full force and effect, nor will such waiver affect
or alter the rights of the holder hereof with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach. The acceptance by the holder hereof of any payment hereunder that is less than payment in full of all amounts due at the time of such payment
will not, without the express written consent of the holder hereof: (i) constitute a waiver of the right to exercise any of such holder s remedies at that time or at any subsequent time, (ii) constitute an accord and
satisfaction, or (iii) nullify any prior exercise of any remedy.  
      D-3  

12. No acceptance of a past due payment or indulgences granted from time to time may be construed
(i) as a novation of this Note or as a reinstatement of the indebtedness evidenced hereby or as a waiver of such right of acceleration or of the right of the holder hereof thereafter to insist upon strict compliance with the terms of this Note, or
(ii) to prevent the exercise of such right of acceleration or any other right granted hereunder or by law.    13. In case any one or
more of the provisions of this Note are determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
   14. Nothing contained in this Note or elsewhere may be deemed or construed to create a partnership or joint venture between the holder
hereof and the Company or between the holder hereof and any other person, or cause the holder hereof to be responsible in any way for the debts or obligations of the Company or any other person.  
 15. It is hereby expressly agreed that, if from any circumstances whatsoever fulfillment of any provision of this Note, at the time performance
of such provision will be due, violate any applicable usury statute or any other law, then ipso facto such provision will be conformed to comply with such statute or law. In no event shall the Company be bound to pay for the use, forbearance or
detention of the money lent pursuant hereto, interest of more than the current legal limit; the right to demand any such excess being hereby expressly waived by the holder hereof.  
 16. THIS NOTE IS MADE UNDER AND IS TO BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT
REGARD TO ITS CHOICE-OF-LAW RULES.    17. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Note may be brought in any state or federal
court located in the State of New York. By execution and delivery hereof, the Company hereby accepts for itself and in respect of property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Nothing herein, however,
shall affect the right of the holder hereof to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Company in any other jurisdiction.  
 18. WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING, THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY, AND THE COMPANY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF  FORUM   NON   CONVENIENS  WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR
PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS. SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE MADE BY THE PAYEE ON THE COMPANY BY MAILING A COPY OF THE SUMMONS AND ANY COMPLAINT TO THE MAKER, BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT
REQUESTED, AT [ ]

limited liability company. The purpose of MMCF is to invest primarily in first lien loans to middle-market companies. MMCF is managed by a six-member board of managers, on which we and Credit Partners each have equal representation. Investment
decisions must be unanimously approved by a quorum of the investment committee, which is comprised of persons appointed equally by us and Credit Partners. Establishing a quorum for MMCF s board of managers requires at least four members to be
present at a meeting, including at least two of our representatives and two of Credit Partners  representatives. We and Credit Partners each have 50% economic ownership of MMCF and have subscribed to fund from time to time capital of MMCF of
$400 million, subject in each case to the prior approval of MMCF s board of managers.
