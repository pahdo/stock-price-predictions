MONITRONICS INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

(1)    Basis of Presentation 
    
  Monitronics International, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company" or "MONI") are wholly owned subsidiaries of Ascent Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascent Capital").  On February 23, 2015, the Company acquired LiveWatch Security, LLC ("LiveWatch"), a Do-It-Yourself home security firm, offering professionally monitored security services through a direct-to-consumer sales channel (the "LiveWatch Acquisition"). The Company provides security alarm monitoring and related services to residential and business subscribers throughout the United States and parts of Canada.  The Company monitors signals arising from burglaries, fires, medical alerts and other events through security systems at subscribers  premises, as well as provides customer service and technical support. 
    
  The unaudited interim financial information of the Company has been prepared in accordance with Article 10 of the Securities and Exchange Commission s (the "SEC") Regulation S-X. Accordingly, it does not include all of the information required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") for complete financial statements.  The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016  , and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , include MONI and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries.  The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the MONI Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on March 7, 2016 (the "2015 Form 10-K"). 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses for each reporting period.  The significant estimates made in preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements primarily relate to valuation of goodwill, other intangible assets, long-lived assets, deferred tax assets, derivative financial instruments, and the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts. These estimates are based on management s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors and adjusts them when facts and circumstances change. As the effects of future events cannot be determined with any certainty, actual results could differ from the estimates upon which the carrying values were based. 

(2)    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  . Under the update, revenue will be recognized based on a five-step model. The core principle of the model is that revenue will be recognized when the transfer of promised goods or services to customers is made in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In March 2016, the FASB issued additional guidance which clarifies principal versus agent considerations, and in April 2016, the FASB issued further guidance which clarifies the identification of performance obligations and the implementation guidance for licensing. Additional guidance was issued in May 2016 which clarified, among other items, revenue collectability, presentation of sales tax and other similar taxes from customers and non-cash consideration. In the third quarter of 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the standard to annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption will be permitted for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that adopting this ASU will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   ("ASU 2016-02").   ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet and eliminates the current requirements for a company to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires a modified retrospective approach.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that adopting ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation--Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share Based Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09").  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements as well as classification of certain elements in the statement of cash flows.  Adoption requirements are different for each change in the reporting method and may be prospective, retrospective and/or modified retrospective.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company plans to adopt the  
  
   6 

     Table of Contents  

standard in its annual report for the period ending December 31, 2016.  The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

(3)    LiveWatch Acquisition 
    
  On February 23, 2015 ("the Closing Date"), the Company acquired LiveWatch for a purchase price of approximately   $61,550,000   (the "LiveWatch Purchase Price"). The LiveWatch Purchase Price includes approximately   $3,988,000   of cash transferred directly to LiveWatch to fund transaction bonuses payable to LiveWatch employees as of the Closing Date. This cash is not included in the fair value of consideration transferred for the LiveWatch Acquisition. The LiveWatch Purchase Price also includes post-closing adjustments of   $435,000   which were paid in the third quarter of 2015. The LiveWatch acquisition was funded by borrowings from MONI's revolving credit facility, as well as cash contributions from Ascent Capital. 
    
  Goodwill in the amount of   $36,047,000   was recognized in connection with the LiveWatch Acquisition and was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the value to MONI for LiveWatch's recurring revenue and cash flow streams and its diversified business model and marketing channel. All of the goodwill acquired in the LiveWatch Acquisition is estimated to be deductible for tax purposes. 
    
  The effect of the LiveWatch Acquisition was not material to the Company's consolidated results for the prior periods presented and, accordingly, proforma financial disclosures have not been presented.

Senior Notes 
    
  The senior notes total   $585,000,000   in principal, mature on April 1, 2020 and bear interest at   9.125%   per annum (the "Senior Notes").  Interest payments are due semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year.  The Senior Notes are guaranteed by all of the Company's existing domestic subsidiaries.  Ascent Capital has not guaranteed any of the Company's obligations under the Senior Notes.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Senior Notes had deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization of   $7,385,000  . 
    
  Ascent Intercompany Loan 
    
  On February 29, 2016, the Company retired the existing intercompany loan with an outstanding principal amount of   $100,000,000   and executed and delivered a Promissory Note to Ascent Capital in a principal amount of   $12,000,000    (the "Ascent Intercompany Loan"), with the   $88,000,000   remaining principal to be a capital contribution.  The entire principal amount under the Ascent Intercompany Loan is due on October 1, 2020.  The Company may prepay any portion of the balance of the Ascent Intercompany Loan at any time from time to time without fee, premium or penalty (subject to certain financial covenants associated with the Company s other indebtedness).  Any unpaid balance of the Ascent Intercompany Loan bears interest at a rate equal to   12.5%    per annum, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on January 12 and July 12 of each year.  The effective rate was   12.5%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   9.868%   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Borrowings under the Ascent Intercompany Loan constitute unsecured obligations of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the Company s subsidiaries. 
    
  Credit Facility 
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment ("Amendment No. 6") with the lenders of its existing senior secured credit agreement dated March 23, 2012, and as amended and restated on April 9, 2015, February 17, 2015, August 16, 2013, March 25, 2013, and November 7, 2012 (the "Existing Credit Agreement").  Amendment No. 6 provided for, among other things, the issuance of a new   $1,100,000,000   senior secured term loan at a   1.5%   discount and a new   $295,000,000   super priority revolver (The Existing Credit Agreement together with Amendment No. 6, the "Credit Facility").   
    
  The Company used the net proceeds from the new term loan to retire   $403,784,000   of its existing term loan due in March 2018 and   $543,125,000   of its existing term loan due in April 2022.  Additionally, the Company retired its existing   $315,000,000   revolving credit facility in the amount of   $138,900,000  .   
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Company borrowed   $48,400,000   on the new Credit Facility revolver to fund its October 1, 2016 interest payment due under the Senior Notes of   $26,691,000   as well as other refinancing fees. 
    
  As a result of the refinancing, the Company accelerated amortization of certain deferred financing costs and debt discounts related to the extinguished term loans, and expensed certain other refinancing costs. The components of the refinancing expense is reflected below (amounts in thousands): 

As of September 30, 2016, the Credit Facility term loan has a principal amount of   $1,100,000,000   maturing on September 30, 2022. The term loan requires quarterly interest payments and quarterly principal payments of   $2,750,000  .  The term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus   5.5%  , subject to a LIBOR floor of   1.0%  .  The Credit Facility revolver has a principal amount outstanding of   $48,400,000   as of September 30, 2016 and matures on September 30, 2021. The Credit Facility revolver bears interest at LIBOR plus   4.0%  , subject to a LIBOR floor of   1.0%  . There is a commitment fee of   0.5%   on unused portions of the Credit Facility Revolver. As of September 30, 2016,   $246,600,000   is available for borrowing under the Credit Facility revolver. 
    
  At any time after the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may, among other options, declare any amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility immediately due and payable and terminate any commitment to make further  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

loans under the Credit Facility.  In addition, failure to comply with restrictions contained in the Senior Notes could lead to an event of default under the Credit Facility. 
    
  The Credit Facility is secured by a pledge of all of the outstanding stock of the Company and all of its existing subsidiaries and is guaranteed by all of the Company s existing domestic subsidiaries.  Ascent Capital has not guaranteed any of the Company s obligations under the Credit Facility. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has deferred financing costs and unamortized discounts, net of accumulated amortization, of   $34,428,000   related to the Credit Facility. 
    
  In order to reduce the financial risk related to changes in interest rates associated with the floating rate term loan under the Credit Facility term loans, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements with terms similar to the Credit Facility term loans (all outstanding interest rate swap agreements are collectively referred to as the  Swaps ).  The Swaps have been designated as effective hedges of the Company s variable rate debt and qualify for hedge accounting.  As a result of these interest rate swaps, the Company's current effective weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the Credit Facility term loan is   7.15%  .  See note 6, Derivatives, for further disclosures related to these derivative instruments.   
    
  The terms of the Senior Notes and the Credit Facility provide for certain financial and nonfinancial covenants.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all required covenants. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , principal payments scheduled to be made on the Company s debt obligations are as follows (amounts in thousands):   

(6)    Derivatives 
    
  The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in the Company s variable rate Credit Facility term loans.  The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatility. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.  See note 7, Fair Value Measurements, for additional information about the credit valuation adjustments.

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016   the Swaps  outstanding notional balances, effective dates, maturity dates and interest rates paid and received are noted below: 

(a)    
    On March 25, 2013 and September 30, 2016, the Company negotiated amendments to the terms of these interest rate swap agreements (the "Existing Swap Agreements," as amended, the  Amended Swaps ).  The Amended Swaps are held with the same counterparties as the Existing Swap Agreements.  Upon entering into the Amended Swaps, MONI simultaneously dedesignated the Existing Swap Agreements and redesignated the Amended Swaps as cash flow hedges for the underlying change in the swap terms.  The amounts previously recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss relating to the dedesignation are recognized in Interest expense over the remaining life of the Amended Swaps. 
       
  All of the Swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments, with the effective portion of the Swaps' change in fair value recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Any ineffective portions of the Swaps' change in fair value are recognized in current earnings in Interest expense.  Changes in the fair value of the Swaps recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified to Interest expense when the hedged interest payments on the underlying debt are recognized.  Amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive loss expected to be recognized in Interest expense in the coming 12 months total approximately   $6,985,000  . 
    
  The impact of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges on the condensed consolidated financial statements is depicted below (amounts in thousands): 

(a)    
    Amounts are included in Interest expense in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Table of Contents  

(7)    Fair Value Measurements 
    
  According to the FASB ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurement  , fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in the following three categories: 

Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  
                
    Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active or inactive markets and valuations derived from models where all significant inputs are observable in active markets. 
                
    Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in any market. 
       
  The following summarizes the fair value level of assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (amounts in thousands):  

The Company has determined that the significant inputs used to value the Swaps fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value are as follows (amounts in thousands): 

(a) 
    T     he fair value is based on market quotations from third party financial institutions and is classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy. 
       
  The Company s other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value because of their short-term maturity.

  The following table provides a summary of the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive loss for the period presented (amounts in thousands):   

(a) 
       Amounts reclassified into net income are included in Interest expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations.  See note 6, Derivatives, for further information. 

(9)    Commitments, Contingencies and Other Liabilities 
    
  The Company is involved in litigation and similar claims incidental to the conduct of its business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable outcome to the Company and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the matters, management s estimate of the outcomes of such matters and experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters.  In management s opinion, none of the pending actions is likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

(10)     Reportable Business Segments 
    
  Description of Segments 
    
  The Company operates through   two   reportable business segments according to the nature and economic characteristics of its services as well as the manner in which the information issued internally by the Company's key decision maker, who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The Company's business segments are as follows: 
    
  MONI 
    
  The MONI segment is primarily engaged in the business of providing security alarm monitoring services: monitoring signals arising from burglaries, fires, medical alerts and other events through security systems at subscribers' premises, as well as providing customer service and technical support. MONI outsources the sales, installation and most of its field service functions to its dealers. By outsourcing the low margin, high fixed-cost elements of its business to a large network of independent service providers, MONI is able to allocate capital to growing its revenue-generating account base rather than to local offices or depreciating hard assets. 
    
  LiveWatch 
    
  LiveWatch is a Do-It-Yourself home security provider offering professionally monitored security services through a direct-to-consumer sales channel. LiveWatch offers a differentiated go-to-market strategy through direct response TV, internet and radio advertising. When a customer initiates the process to obtain monitoring services, LiveWatch pre-configures the alarm monitoring system based on customer specifications. LiveWatch then packages and ships the equipment directly to the customer. The customer self-installs the equipment on-site and activates the monitoring service over the phone.

     Table of Contents  

As they arise, transactions between segments are recorded on an arm's length basis using relevant market prices.  Prior to the acquisition of LiveWatch in February 2015, Ascent Capital had   one   operating segment.  Therefore, the LiveWatch segment only includes amounts incurred from the purchase date. The following table sets forth selected data from the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands):

(11)    Consolidating Guarantor Financial Information 
    
  The Senior Notes were issued by Monitronics (the  Parent Issuer ) and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by all of the Company s existing domestic subsidiaries ( Subsidiary Guarantors ).  Ascent Capital has not guaranteed any of the Company s obligations under the Senior Notes.

Overview 
    
  The Company provides security alarm monitoring and related services to residential and business subscribers throughout the United States and parts of Canada.   On February 23, 2015 (the "Closing Date"), the Company acquired LiveWatch Security, LLC ("LiveWatch"), a Do-It-Yourself home security firm, offering professionally monitored security services through a direct-to-consumer sales channel (the "LiveWatch Acquisition").  The Company monitors signals arising from burglaries, fires, medical alerts and other events through security systems at subscribers  premises, as well as provides customer service and technical support.  Nearly all of the Company s revenues are derived from monthly recurring revenues under security alarm monitoring contracts purchased from independent dealers in its exclusive nationwide network. 
    
  Attrition 
    
  Account cancellation, otherwise referred to as subscriber attrition, has a direct impact on the number of subscribers that the Company services and on its financial results, including revenues, operating income and cash flow.  A portion of the subscriber base can be expected to cancel its service every year. Subscribers may choose not to renew or terminate their contract for a variety of reasons, including relocation, cost and switching to a competitor s service.  The largest category of canceled accounts relate to subscriber relocation or the inability to contact the subscriber.  The Company defines its attrition rate as the number of canceled accounts in a given period divided by the weighted average of number of subscribers for that period.  The Company considers an account canceled if payment from the subscriber is deemed uncollectible or if the subscriber cancels for various reasons.  If a subscriber relocates but continues its service, this is not a cancellation.  If the subscriber relocates, discontinues its service and a new subscriber takes over the original subscriber s service continuing the revenue stream, this is also not a cancellation.  The Company adjusts the number of canceled accounts by excluding those that are contractually guaranteed by its dealers.  The typical dealer contract provides that if a subscriber cancels in the first year of its contract, the dealer must either replace the canceled account with a new one or refund to the Company the cost paid to acquire the contract. To help ensure the dealer s obligation to the Company, the Company typically maintains a dealer funded holdback reserve ranging from 5-10% of subscriber accounts in the guarantee period.  In some cases, the amount of the holdback liability may be less than actual attrition experience. 
    
  The table below presents subscriber data for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(a) 
    Includes canceled accounts that are contractually guaranteed to be refunded from holdback. 
              (b) 
    Includes an estimated 10,488 accounts included in our Radio Conversion Program that canceled in excess of their expected attrition. 
              (c) 
    The recurring monthly revenue ("RMR") of canceled accounts follows the same definition as subscriber unit attrition as noted above.  RMR attrition is defined as the RMR of canceled accounts in a given period, adjusted for the impact of price increases or decreases in that period, divided by the weighted average of RMR for that period. 
       
  The unit attrition rate for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   13.9%   and   13.5%  , respectively. Increased attrition is primarily the result of an increase in the number of subscriber accounts reaching the end of their initial contract term in the period.  Overall attrition reflects the impact of the Pinnacle Security bulk buys, where the Company purchased approximately 113,000 accounts from Pinnacle Security in 2012 and 2013, which are now experiencing normal end-of-term attrition.  The attrition rate without the Pinnacle Security accounts (core attrition) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 13.3% and 12.5%, respectively.

     Table of Contents  

We analyze our attrition by classifying accounts into annual pools based on the year of acquisition.  We then track the number of accounts that cancel as a percentage of the initial number of accounts acquired for each pool for each year subsequent to its acquisition.  Over the next few years of the subscriber account life, the number of subscribers that cancel as a percentage of the initial number of subscribers in that pool gradually increases and historically has peaked following the end of the initial contract term, which is typically three to five years.  The peak following the end of the initial contract term is primarily a result of the buildup of subscribers that moved or no longer had need for the service but did not cancel their service until the end of their initial contract term.  Subsequent to the peak following the end of the initial contract term, the number of subscribers that cancel as a percentage of the initial number of subscribers in that pool declines. 
    
  Accounts Acquired 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company acquired 32,570 and 44,776 subscriber accounts, respectively. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company acquired 99,065 and 151,592 subscriber accounts, respectively.  Accounts acquired for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflect bulk buys of approximately 6,700 accounts, respectively.  Accounts acquired for the three months ended September 30, 2015 includes bulk buys of approximately 600 accounts. Accounts acquired for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   includes bulk buys of approximately 1,800 accounts and 31,919 accounts from the LiveWatch Acquisition in February 2015.  
    
  RMR acquired during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was $1,545,000 and $2,094,000, respectively. RMR acquired during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 was $4,603,000 and $6,468,000, respectively. RMR acquired for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   includes approximately $909,000 of RMR from the LiveWatch Acquisition in February 2015. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA 
  We evaluate the performance of our operations based on financial measures such as revenue and "Adjusted EBITDA." Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization (including the amortization of subscriber accounts, dealer network and other intangible assets), stock-based compensation, and other non-cash or nonrecurring charges. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its business, including the business  ability to fund its ongoing acquisition of subscriber accounts, to fund its capital expenditures and to service its debt. In addition, this measure is used by management to evaluate operating results and perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve performance.  Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure that is customarily used by financial analysts to evaluate the financial performance of companies in the security alarm monitoring industry and is one of the financial measures, subject to certain adjustments, by which our covenants are calculated under the agreements governing their debt obligations. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss and is indicative neither of our results of operations nor of cash flows available to fund all of our cash needs. It is, however, a measurement that we believe is useful to investors in analyzing its operating performance. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. As companies often define non-GAAP financial measures differently, Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by MONI should not be compared to any similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
    
  Pre-SAC Adjusted EBITDA 
    
  LiveWatch is a direct-to-consumer business, and as such recognizes certain revenue and expenses associated with subscriber acquisition (subscriber acquisition costs, or "SAC"). This is in contrast to MONI, which capitalizes payments to dealers to acquire accounts. "Pre-SAC Adjusted EBITDA" is a measure that eliminates the impact of acquiring accounts at the LiveWatch business that is recognized in operating income. Pre-SAC Adjusted EBITDA is defined as total Adjusted EBITDA excluding LiveWatch's SAC and the related revenue. We believe Pre-SAC Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of the Company's financial performance in servicing its customer base. Pre-SAC Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Pre-SAC Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. As companies often define non-GAAP financial measures differently, Pre-SAC Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by the Company should not be compared to any similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Results of Operations 
    
  The following table sets forth selected data from the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands).   

(a)    
    See reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA below. 
              (b)    
    See reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Pre-SAC Adjusted EBITDA below.   
              (c) 
    Presented below is the reconciliation of Net revenue to Pre-SAC net revenue (amounts in thousands) 

Net revenue.    Net revenue increased   $919,000  , or   0.6%  , and   $7,884,000  , or   1.9%  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods.  The increase in net revenue is attributable to an increase in average RMR per subscriber, as well as, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the inclusion of a full first quarter's impact of LiveWatch revenue, compared to corresponding prior year periods.  Average monthly revenue per subscriber increased from $41.63 as of   September 30, 2015   to $42.84 as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Cost of services  .  Cost of services increased   $804,000  , or   2.8%  , and   $5,146,000  , or   6.4%  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods.The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is attributable to increased field service costs due to a higher volume of retention jobs being completed in the quarter.  The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is attributable to higher cellular costs with more subscribers taking on interactive and home automation services, increased lead generation fees at MONI and higher subscriber acquisition costs seen at LiveWatch related to a full first quarter impact in 2016 and an increase in new account production. LiveWatch's subscriber acquisition costs include expensed equipment costs associated with the creation of new subscribers of $2,132,000 and $6,466,000 for three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $2,210,000 and $4,666,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  Cost of services as a percent of net revenue increased from   19.9%   for the   three months ended September 30,     2015   to   20.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and increased from   19.2%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   to   20.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative.    Selling, general and administrative costs ("SG A") increased   $1,790,000  , or   6.4%  , and   $10,485,000  , or   13.6%  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the  
  
   24 

     Table of Contents  

corresponding prior year periods.  The increases are attributable to subscriber acquisition costs incurred at LiveWatch,increased salaries, wages and benefits and rebranding expense at MONI. LiveWatch's subscriber acquisition costs, which includes marketing and sales costs related to the creation of new subscribers, was $4,515,000 and $12,002,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $3,269,000 and $7,089,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase is attributable to an increase in new account production and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the impact of a full first quarter of costs being incurred as compared to the corresponding prior year period.  SG A as a percent of net revenue increased from   19.7%   and   18.3%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, to   20.8%   and   20.4%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Amortization of subscriber accounts, dealer network and other intangible assets  .  Amortization of subscriber accounts, dealer network and other intangible assets decreased   $4,802,000   and   $8,210,000  , or   7.2%   and   4.2%  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods.  The decrease is related to the timing of amortization of subscriber accounts acquired prior to the third quarter of 2015, which have a lower rate of amortization in 2016 based on the applicable double declining balance amortization method.  The decrease is partially offset by increased amortization related to accounts acquired subsequent to   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Interest expense.    Interest expense decreased   $1,642,000   and   $1,925,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the corresponding prior year period, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the principal decrease in the Company's intercompany note with Ascent Capital. 
    
  Income tax expense.    The Company had pre-tax loss of   $21,073,000   and   $54,259,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and income tax expense of   $1,929,000   and   $5,462,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The Company had pre-tax loss of   $19,433,000   and   $39,782,000   and income tax expense of   $1,981,000   and   $5,953,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Income tax expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is attributable to Texas state margin tax incurred on the Company's operations and the deferred tax impact from amortization of deductible goodwill related to the Company's recent acquisitions. 
    
  Net loss  . The Company had net loss of   $23,002,000   and   $59,721,000   for the   three and nine   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   $21,414,000   and   $45,735,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The increase in net loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to an increase in costs incurred under the Company's Radio Conversion Program of $13,395,000, as well as the impacts discussed above.

     Table of Contents  

Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-SAC Adjusted EBITDA.   The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss to total Adjusted EBITDA to Pre-SAC Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated (amounts in thousands):   

Adjusted EBITDA decreased   $1,482,000   or   1.7%   and   $7,464,000  , or    2.8%  , for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively as compared to the corresponding prior year periods.  The decrease is primarily due to increases in LiveWatch's subscriber acquisition costs, net of related revenue, associated with growth in new RMR production.   
  These costs went from $4,307,000 and $8,916,000 for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to $5,523,000 and $15,168,000 for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Pre-SAC Adjusted EBITDA decreased   $266,000  , or   0.3%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $1,212,000  , or   0.4%  , for the   nine   months ended    September 30, 2016  .   
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $28,686,000   of cash and cash equivalents.  Our primary sources of funds are our cash flows from operating activities which are generated from alarm monitoring and related service revenues.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our cash flow from operating activities was   $158,959,000   and   $173,237,000  , respectively.  The primary driver of our cash flow from operating activities is Adjusted EBITDA.  Fluctuations in our Adjusted EBITDA and the components of that measure are discussed in  Results of Operations  above.  In addition, our cash flow from operating activities may be significantly impacted by changes in working capital. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company used cash of   $160,117,000   and   $205,050,000  , respectively, to fund subscriber account acquisitions, net of holdback and guarantee obligations.  In addition, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company used cash of   $5,071,000   and   $10,034,000  , respectively, to fund its capital expenditures. 
    
  In 2015, MONI paid cash of $56,778,000 for the acquisition of LiveWatch, net of the transfer of $3,988,000 to LiveWatch upon the Closing Date to fund LiveWatch employees' transaction bonuses and LiveWatch cash on hand of $784,000.  The LiveWatch Acquisition was funded by borrowings from the Company's  expanded Credit Facility revolver as well as cash contributions from Ascent Capital. 
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment ("Amendment No. 6") with the lenders of its existing senior secured credit agreement dated March 23, 2012, and as amended and restated on April 9, 2015, February 17, 2015, August 16,  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

2013, March 25, 2013, and November 7, 2012 (the "Existing Credit Agreement").  Amendment No. 6 provided for, among other things, the issuance of a new $1,100,000,000 senior secured term loan at a 1.5% discount and a new $295,000,000 super priority revolver (the Existing Credit Agreement together with Amendment No. 6, the "Credit Facility").  
    
  The Company used the net proceeds from the new term loan to retire $403,784,000 of its existing term loan due in March 2018 and $543,125,000 of its existing term loan due in April 2022.  Additionally, the Company retired its existing $315,000,000 revolving credit facility in the amount of $138,900,000. 
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Company borrowed $48,400,000 on the new Credit Facility revolver to fund its October 1, 2016 interest payment due under the Senior Notes of $26,691,000 as well as other refinancing fees. 
    
  The existing long-term debt of the Company at   September 30, 2016   includes the principal balance of   $1,745,400,000   under its Senior Notes, Credit Facility term loans, and Credit Facility revolver. The Senior Notes have an outstanding principal balance of   $585,000,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and mature on April 1, 2020. The Ascent Intercompany Loan has an outstanding principal balance of   $12,000,000   and matures on October 1, 2020.  The Credit Facility Term Loan has an outstanding principal balance of   $1,100,000,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and require principal payments of $2,750,000 per quarter with the remainder becoming due on September 30, 2022  The Credit Facility revolver has an outstanding balance of   $48,400,000    as of   September 30, 2016   and becomes due on September 30, 2021. 
    
  In considering our liquidity requirements for the remainder of 2016, we evaluated our known future commitments and obligations.  In 2014, the Company implemented a Radio Conversion Program in response to one of the nation's largest carriers announcing that it does not intend to support its 2G cellular network services beyond 2016.  In connection with the Radio Conversion Program, the Company could incur incremental costs of up to $1,000,000 for the remainder of 2016.  We considered the borrowing capacity of our Credit Facility revolver, under which we could borrow an additional   $246,600,000   as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on this analysis, we expect that cash on hand, cash flow generated from operations and available borrowings under the Credit Facility revolver will provide sufficient liquidity, given our anticipated current and future requirements. 
    
  We may seek capital contributions from Ascent Capital or debt financing in the event of any new investment opportunities, additional capital expenditures or our operations requiring additional funds, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain capital contributions from Ascent Capital or debt financing on terms that would be acceptable to us or at all.  Our ability to seek additional sources of funding depends on our future financial position and results of operations, which are subject to general conditions in or affecting our industry and our customers and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control.

  Due to the terms of our debt obligations, we have exposure to changes in interest rates related to these debt obligations.  The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure related to the movement in interest rates.  The derivatives are designated as hedges and were entered into with the intention of reducing the risk associated with variable interest rates on the debt obligations.  We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
    
  Tabular Presentation of Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The table below provides information about our outstanding debt obligations and derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.   Interest rate swaps are presented at their fair value amount and by maturity date as of   September 30, 2016  .  Debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date as of   September 30, 2016  .  

(a)    
    The derivative financial instruments reflected in this column include four interest rate swaps with a maturity date of March 23, 2018 and three interest rate swaps with a maturity date of April 9, 2022.  As a result of these interest rate swaps, the Company's current effective weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the Credit Facility term loans is   7.15%  .  See notes 5, 6 and 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for further information. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
    
  In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer (the "Executives"), of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, the Executives concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
    
  There has been no change in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.
