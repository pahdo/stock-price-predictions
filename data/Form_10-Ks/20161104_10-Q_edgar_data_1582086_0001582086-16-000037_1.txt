Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  Some of the statements under "Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  " and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA"). The PSLRA provides a "safe harbor" for forward-looking statements. These forward looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Such statements include forward looking statements with respect to us specifically and the insurance and reinsurance business generally, investments, capital markets and the general economic environments in which we operate. Statements which include the words "expect," "intend," "plan," "believe," "project," "anticipate," "seek," "will," and similar statements of a future or forward-looking nature identify forward-looking statements for purposes of the PSLRA or otherwise. 
    
  All forward-looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
             
    the fact that we have limited operating history; 
                
    the possibility of severe or unanticipated losses from natural and man-made catastrophes, including those that may result from changes in climate conditions, including global temperatures and expected sea levels;  
                
    the effectiveness of our loss limitation methods;  
                
    our dependence on our Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), both of whom are not our direct employees, and our service providers including Blue Capital Management Ltd. (the "Manager") which provides various underwriting, investment and administrative services; 
                
    our ability to effectively execute our business plan and any new ventures that we may enter into; 
                
    continued acceptance of our business strategy, security and financial condition by regulators, brokers and insureds; 
                
    failure by any service provider to carry out its obligations to us in accordance with the terms of its appointment; 
                
    conflicts of interest that could result from our relationships and potential overlaps in business with related parties, including Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd. ("Endurance") and its subsidiaries; 
                
    the cyclical nature of the property catastrophe insurance and reinsurance industry; 
                
    the availability of capital and financing, including our ability to raise more equity capital and our ability to release capital from existing obligations to redeploy annually; 
                
    the levels of new and renewal business achieved; 
                
    the availability of opportunities to increase writings within our property and catastrophe lines of business and our ability to capitalize on those opportunities; 
                
    the inherent uncertainty of our risk management process, which is subject to, among other things, industry loss estimates and estimates generated by modeling techniques; 
                
    the inherent uncertainties in establishing loss and loss adjustment expense ("LAE") reserves and unanticipated adjustments to premium estimates; 
                
    changes in the availability, cost or quality of reinsurance or retrocessional coverage; 
                
    general economic and market conditions, including inflation, volatility in the credit and capital markets and conditions specific to the insurance and reinsurance markets in which we operate; 
                
    changes in and the impact of governmental legislation or regulation, including changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions where we conduct business; 
                
    statutory or regulatory developments, including those involving tax policy, reinsurance and other regulatory matters such as the adoption of proposed legislation that would affect Bermuda-headquartered companies or Bermuda-based insurers or reinsurers; 
                
    potential treatment of us as an investment company or a passive foreign investment company for purposes of U.S. securities laws or U.S. federal taxation, respectively; 
                
    the impact of the United Kingdom's June 2016 referendum on European Union membership and the potential withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union;

     Table of Contents  

the amount and timing of reinsurance recoveries; 
                
    the effects of competitors' pricing policies, and of changes in laws and regulations on competition, industry consolidation and development of competing financial products; 
                
    the overall level of competition, and the related supply and demand dynamics in our markets relating to growing capital levels in our industry; 
                
    actions by our competitors, many of which are larger or have greater financial resources than we do; 
                
    declining demand due to increased retentions by cedants and other factors; 
                
    acts of terrorism, political unrest, outbreak of war and other hostilities or other non-forecasted and unpredictable events; 
                
    unexpected developments concerning the small number of insurance and reinsurance brokers upon whom we rely for a large portion of revenues; 
                
    the ability of the counterparty institutions with which we conduct business to continue to meet their obligations to us; 
                
    operational risks, including the risk of fraud and any errors and omissions, as well as technology breaches or failures; 
                
    changes in tax regulations or laws applicable to us, our subsidiaries, brokers or customers; 
                
    our dependence as a holding company upon dividends or distributions from our operating subsidiaries; and 
                
    changes in accounting principles or the application of such principles by regulators. 
       
  The foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included herein and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015   (the "  2015   Form 10-K") and in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, each as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including the risk factors set forth in Item 1A thereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made.

NOTE 1.                Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation and Overview 
    
  Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings Ltd. (the "Company" or the "Registrant") is a Bermuda exempted limited liability company that, through its subsidiaries (collectively "Blue Capital"), offers collateralized reinsurance in the property catastrophe market and invests in various insurance-linked securities. The Company was incorporated under the laws of Bermuda on June 24, 2013, and commenced its operations on November 12, 2013. The Company's headquarters and principal executive offices are located at Waterloo House, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke, Bermuda HM 08, which is also our registered office. 
    
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements incorporated in this report on Form 10-Q  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP. Certain prior period amounts, all of which are immaterial, have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the   2015   Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, these interim unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly present the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Registrant and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of financial results for the full year. The December 31,   2015   consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP. 
    
  There were no material changes in the Company's significant accounting and reporting policies subsequent to the filing of the   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues earned and expenses incurred during the period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The significant estimates reflected in these interim unaudited consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, loss and LAE reserves and written and earned reinsurance premiums. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are recorded in the consolidated financial statements in the period that they are determined to be necessary. 
    
  The Company operates as a single business segment through its wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Blue Capital Re Ltd. ("Blue Capital Re"), a Bermuda Class 3A insurer which provides collateralized reinsurance; and (ii) Blue Capital Re ILS Ltd. ("Blue Capital Re ILS"), a Bermuda exempted limited liability company which conducts hedging and other investment activities, including entering into industry loss warranties and related instruments, in support of Blue Capital Re's operations. Blue Capital leverages the reinsurance underwriting expertise and infrastructure of Endurance and its various subsidiaries to conduct its business. Endurance is the beneficial owner of   33.3%   of the Company's outstanding Common Shares. 
    
  Subject to the discretion of the Company s board of directors (the "Board"), the Company intends to continue to distribute through dividends or repurchases of Common Shares a minimum of   90%   of its annual Distributable Income to its holders of Common Shares and RSUs. "Distributable Income," a non-GAAP measure, means GAAP net income plus (minus) non-cash expenses (revenues) recorded in net income for the period.   
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Entities will be required to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The guidance also changes employers' accounting for an employee's use

NOTE 2.                Written and Earned Reinsurance Premiums 
    
  Written premiums represent business bound from ceding companies and net earned premiums represent the portion of net written premiums (gross written premiums less any ceded reinsurance) which is recognized as revenue over the period of time that coverage is provided. 
    
  Blue Capital seeks to diversify its exposure across geographic zones around the world in order to obtain a prudent spread of risk. The spread of these exposures is also a function of market conditions and opportunities. The following table sets forth a breakdown of Blue Capital's premiums written by geographic area of risks insured during the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :                                 

(1)               "Worldwide" comprises reinsurance contracts that cover risks in more than one geographic area and do not specifically exclude the U.S.

NOTE 3.                            Derivative Instruments 
    
  Inward Industry Loss Warranty ("ILW") Swaps 
    
  In February 2016, Blue Capital Re ILS entered into an inward ILW swap (the "2016 Inward ILW Swap") with a third-party under which qualifying loss payments are triggered by reference to the level of losses incurred by the insurance industry as a whole, rather than by losses incurred by the insured. In return for a fixed payment received of   $0.4 million  , Blue Capital Re ILS is required to make a floating payment in the event of certain losses incurred from specified natural catastrophes in the U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand from February 2016 to February 2017. Blue Capital Re ILS's maximum payment obligation under the 2016 Inward ILW Swap is   $2.7 million  . Through   September 30, 2016  , Blue Capital Re ILS was not aware of any industry loss event occurring that would have triggered a payment obligation under the 2016 Inward ILW Swap. 
    
  The 2016 Inward ILW Swap is valued on the basis of models developed by the Manager, which represent unobservable (Level 3) inputs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the 2016 Inward ILW Swap was   $0.2 million  , which was recorded as an "other liability" on the Company's   September 30, 2016   Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet.

  In February 2015, Blue Capital Re ILS entered into an inward ILW swap (the "2015 Inward ILW Swap") with a third-party under which qualifying loss payments are triggered by reference to the level of losses incurred by the insurance industry as a whole, rather than by losses incurred by the insured.  In return for a fixed payment received of   $0.6 million  , Blue Capital Re ILS was required to make a floating payment in the event of certain losses incurred from specified natural catastrophes in the U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand from February 2015 to February 2016.

NOTE 3.                            Derivative Instruments, cont'd 
    
  In June 2015, Blue Capital Re ILS entered into an outward ILW swap (the  2015 Outward ILW Swap ) with a third-party in order to purchase protection against U.S. wind exposures from June 2015 to December 2015. In return for a fixed payment of   $0.7 million  , Blue Capital Re ILS was entitled to receive a floating payment in the event of certain losses incurred by the insurance industry as a whole. The maximum recovery to Blue Capital Re ILS under the 2015 Outward ILW Swap was   $3.7 million  . Through   September 30, 2015  , Blue Capital Re ILS was not aware of any industry loss event occurring which would have triggered a recovery under the 2015 Outward ILW Swap. 
    
  The 2015 Outward ILW Swap was valued on the basis of a model developed by the Manager, which represented unobservable (Level 3) inputs.  
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , Blue Capital Re recognized a loss from derivative instruments of   $0.5 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively, pursuant to the 2015 Outward ILW Swap 

NOTE 4.                            Basic and Diluted Earnings per Common Share  
    
  The Company applies the two-class method of calculating its earnings per Common Share. In applying the two-class method, any outstanding RSUs are considered to be participating securities. See Note 6.  For all periods presented in which RSUs were outstanding, the two-class method was used to determine basic and diluted earnings per Common Share since this method yielded a more dilutive result than the treasury stock method. 
    
  For purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per Common Share, a portion of net income is allocated to outstanding RSUs which serves to reduce the Company s earnings per Common Share numerators. Net losses are not allocated to outstanding RSUs and, therefore, do not impact the Company's per Common Share numerators in any period in which it incurs a net loss. 
    
  The following table outlines the Company's computation of its basic and diluted earnings per Common Share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1)            During the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the net earnings allocated to participating securities totaled less than   $0.1 million  .  
    
  Dividends to Holders of Common Shares and RSUs 
    
  The Company declared regular cash dividends per Common Share and RSU of   $0.30   during each of the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $0.90   per Common Share and RSU during each of the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  In addition, in February 2016 and 2015, the Company declared special dividends with respect to its 2015 and 2014 Distributable Income of   $1.24   and   $0.66  , respectively, per Common Share and RSU. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $2.6 million   of dividends payable to holders of Common Shares and RSUs, which is included within "other liabilities" on its Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet at that date. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   dividends payable to holders of Common Shares and RSUs.  
    
  The total amount of dividends paid to holders of Common Shares and RSUs during the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $16.1 million   and   $11.1 million  , respectively.

NOTE 4.                            Basic and Diluted Earnings per Common Share cont'd 
    
  There are restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Company, Blue Capital Re and Blue Capital Re ILS.  Any future determination to pay dividends to holders of Common Shares and RSUs will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon many factors, including the Company's results of operations, cash flows, financial position, capital requirements, general business opportunities, and legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions. 

NOTE 5.                            Credit Agreement 
    
  On May 6, 2016, the Company entered into a credit facility (the "2016 Credit Facility") with Endurance Investment Holdings Ltd. (the "Lender"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Endurance. The 2016 Credit Facility provides the Company with an unsecured   $20.0 million   revolving credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes and expires on September 30, 2018. The 2016 Credit Facility replaces the 2014 Credit Agreement and related Guarantee Agreement which expired on April 29, 2016.  Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility bear interest, set at the time of the borrowing, at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus   150   basis points. A one-time fee of   $20,000   was due to the Lender in connection with establishing the 2016 Credit Facility. The 2016 Credit Facility contains covenants that limit the Company s ability, among other things, to grant liens on its assets, sell assets, merge or consolidate, or incur debt.  If the Company fails to comply with any of these covenants, the Lender could revoke the facility and exercise remedies against the Company. In addition, in the event of a default in the performance of any of the agreements or covenants under certain management agreements with the Manager by the Company, the Lender has the right to terminate the 2016 Credit Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all of its respective covenants associated with the 2016 Credit Facility. 
    
  On May 1, 2015, the Company renewed its   364  -day unsecured credit agreement (the "2014 Credit Agreement", together with the 2016 Credit Facility the "Credit Agreements") which permitted it to borrow up to   $20.0 million   on a revolving basis for working capital and general corporate purposes.  Borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement incurred interest, set at the time of the borrowing, at a rate equal to the   3-month LIBOR   rate plus 100 basis points. The Company was also subject to an ongoing annual commitment and administrative fee of   0.375%   of the facility's total capacity. 
    
  Endurance served as a guarantor of the Company's obligations under the 2014 Credit Agreement and received an annual guarantee fee from the Company equal to   0.125%   of the facility's total capacity (the "Guarantee Agreement").  See Note 7. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   nil   and   $13.0 million   of outstanding borrowings, respectively, under the Credit Agreements. With respect to the Company's outstanding borrowings at   December 31, 2015  ,   $4.0 million   was repaid on February 2, 2016 and was subject to an annual interest rate of   1.33%  ,   $5.0 million   was repaid on February 22, 2016 and was subject to an annual interest rate of   1.48%   and   $4.0 million   was repaid on March 11, 2016 and was subject to an annual interest rate of   1.51%  . 
    
  During the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company paid interest on its borrowings under the Credit Agreements of less than   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively. 
    
  During each of the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred less than   $0.1 million   in facility and structuring fees in connection with the Credit Agreements. These fees are included within ''general and administrative expenses'' on the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

NOTE 5.                            Credit Agreement cont'd 
    
  The 2014 Credit Agreement, which expired on April 29, 2016, contained covenants that limited the Company's ability to, among other things, grant liens on its assets, sell assets, merge or consolidate, incur debt and enter into certain transactions with affiliates.  The 2014 Credit Agreement also contained covenants that required: (i) the Company to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to   22.5%  ; (ii) the Company to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of no less than   70%   of its consolidated tangible net worth as of May 2, 2014 (the original closing date of the Credit Agreement); (iii) Endurance to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of less than   35.0%  ; (iv) Endurance to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of no less than   $1.8 billion  ; and (v) each of Endurance's regulated insurance subsidiaries that has a claims paying rating from A.M.

NOTE 6.                            Share-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company's 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2013 LTIP"), which was adopted by the Board in September 2013, permits the issuance of up to   one percent   of the aggregate Common Shares outstanding to participants. Incentive awards that may be granted under the 2013 LTIP include RSUs, restricted Common Shares, incentive share options (on a limited basis), non-qualified share options, share appreciation rights, deferred share units, performance compensation awards, performance units, cash incentive awards and other equity-based and equity-related awards.  
    
  At the discretion of the Board's Compensation and Nominating Committee, incentive awards, the value of which are based on Common Shares, may be made to the Company's directors, future employees and consultants pursuant to the 2013 LTIP.  For all periods presented, the Company's outstanding share-based incentive awards consisted solely of RSUs. 
    
  RSUs are phantom (as opposed to actual) Common Shares which, depending on the individual award, vest in equal tranches over a   one   to   five  -year period subject to the recipient maintaining a continuous relationship with the Company through the applicable vesting date. RSUs are payable in Common Shares upon vesting (the amount of which may be reduced by applicable statutory income tax withholdings at the recipient's option). RSUs do not require the payment of an exercise price and are not entitled to voting rights, but they are entitled to receive payments equivalent to any dividends and distributions declared on the Common Shares underlying the RSUs. 
    
  There were no awards of RSUs and no RSUs vested during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company awarded a total of   7,095   RSUs (  2015  :   7,000  ) to directors of its Board. The RSUs earn ratably each year based on continued service as a director over a   three  -year vesting period. The grant date fair value of the RSUs was   $0.1 million   (  2015  :   $0.1 million  ). During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   3,736   RSUs (  2015  :   2,335  ) vested. The fair value of the vesting RSUs was   $0.1 million   (  2015  : less than   $0.1 million  ).  
    
  During each of the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized less than   $0.1 million   of RSU expense. During each of the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized   $0.1 million   of RSU expense. At   September 30, 2016   compensation costs not yet recognized related to unvested RSUs was   $0.1 million  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   13,158   and   9,799   RSUs outstanding under the 2013 LTIP.

  The Company and its subsidiaries may not terminate the Investment Management Agreement, the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement or the Administrative Services Agreement until the fifth anniversary of the completion of its initial public offering on November 5, 2013 (the "IPO"), whether or not the Manager's performance results are satisfactory.

NOTE 8.                     Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, cont'd 
    
  Litigation 
    
  Blue Capital Re, as a reinsurer, is subject to litigation and arbitration proceedings in the normal course of its business.  Such proceedings often involve reinsurance contract disputes which are typical for the reinsurance industry.  Blue Capital Re's estimates of possible losses incurred in connection with such legal proceedings are provided for as "loss and loss adjustment expenses" on its Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and are included within "loss and loss adjustment expense reserves" on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries had no unresolved legal proceedings at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Concentrations of Credit and Counterparty Risk 
    
  Blue Capital Re ILS's derivative instruments are subject to counterparty risk. The Company and the Manager routinely monitor this risk. 
    
  Blue Capital Re markets retrocessional and reinsurance policies worldwide through brokers.  Credit risk exists to the extent that any of these brokers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to Blue Capital Re.  For example, Blue Capital Re is required to pay amounts owed on claims under policies to brokers, and these brokers, in turn, pay these amounts to the ceding companies that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with Blue Capital Re. In some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a payment, Blue Capital Re might remain liable to the ceding company for the deficiency. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, when the ceding company pays premiums for these policies to brokers, these premiums are considered to have been paid and the ceding insurer is no longer liable to Blue Capital Re for those amounts, whether or not the premiums have actually been received. 
    
  Blue Capital Re remains liable for losses it incurs to the extent that any third-party reinsurer is unable or unwilling to make timely payments under reinsurance agreements.  Blue Capital Re would also be liable in the event that its ceding companies were unable to collect amounts due from underlying third-party reinsurers. 

NOTE 9.                     Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  GAAP requires disclosure of fair value information for certain financial instruments.  For those financial instruments in which quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market rates or quoted market prices for similar obligations.  These estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. Blue Capital carries its assets and liabilities that constitute financial instruments on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with the exception of its outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreements. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the Company's outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreements, each of which were of a short duration, approximated their carrying value of   nil   and   $13.0 million  , respectively. See Note 5. 

NOTE 10.                   Subsequent Event 
    
  On October 7 and 8, 2016, Hurricane Matthew traveled alongside the southeastern coast of the United States, ultimately making landfall in South Carolina. To date, reported claims as a result of this storm have been limited. Accordingly, while losses emanating from the storm cannot be accurately estimated at this time, the Company may need to establish appropriate loss reserves related to Hurricane Matthew in the fourth quarter of 2016, which may have a negative impact on its results of operations.

Item 2.                         Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  General 
    
  The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and our financial condition as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained in the   2015   Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC. 
    
  Overview 
    
  We are a Bermuda reinsurance holding company which offers collateralized reinsurance in the property catastrophe market. Our principal objective is to maximize the expected total return for our shareholders, primarily through the payment of dividends, by underwriting a diversified portfolio of short-tail reinsurance contracts and investing in insurance-linked securities with what we believe to be attractive risk and return characteristics. We provide our shareholders with the opportunity to own an alternative asset class whose returns we believe have historically been largely uncorrelated to those of other asset classes, such as global equities, bonds and hedge funds. 
    
  Subject to the discretion of the Company s board of directors (the "Board"), the Company intends to continue to distribute through dividends or repurchases of Common Shares a minimum of 90% of its annual Distributable Income to its holders of Common Shares and RSUs. "Distributable Income," a non-GAAP measure, means GAAP net income plus (minus) non-cash expenses (revenues) recorded in net income for the period.   
    
  The majority of our property catastrophe business is originated during the key January and June annual renewal periods. 
    
  We experienced continued competition during the January 1 and June 1, 2016 renewal periods, due to relatively light industry catastrophe losses experienced over the past several years. As a result, we experienced an overall rate decrease of approximately 7% and 3% on the risks we wrote at January 1, and June 1, 2016, respectively, versus those written a year ago. Despite the competitive market conditions we currently face, through the efforts of the Manager thus far in 2016, we believe that we have achieved preferred signings with our business partners including a shift in the profile of renewal premiums where we increased our participation in the retrocessional quota share agreement with Endurance Bermuda and reduced the amount of other indemnity reinsurance and retro ILW business in our portfolio. 
    
  Review of Consolidated Results of Operations 
    
  We operate as a single business segment through the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Blue Capital Re, a Bermuda exempted limited liability company registered as a Class 3A insurer in Bermuda, which offers collateralized reinsurance; and (ii) Blue Capital Re ILS, a Bermuda exempted limited liability company which conducts hedging and other investment activities in support of Blue Capital Re s operations.

     Table of Contents  

Our consolidated results of operations for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Reinsurance Premiums Written and Earned 
    
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we wrote   $7.8 million   and   $5.9 million   of reinsurance premiums, respectively, all of which represented indemnity reinsurance contracts relating to property catastrophe risks. The increase in reinsurance premiums written during the   third   quarter of   2016   versus that of the comparable   2015   period resulted as we increased our participation in the retrocessional quota share agreement with Endurance Bermuda (the "Endurance Quota Share Agreement") under which premiums are recorded as written uniformly over the period of the agreement.  
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we wrote   $34.5 million   and   $33.6 million   of reinsurance premiums, respectively, all of which represented indemnity reinsurance contracts relating to property catastrophe risks. The increase in reinsurance premiums written during the first   nine   months of   2016  , versus that of the comparable   2015   period, was primarily the result of business mix changes year over year. In 2016, there was a reduction in the amount of other indemnity reinsurance and retro ILW business renewed in January and we increased our participation in the Endurance Quota Share Agreement which resulted in written premiums increasing. 
    
  Net premiums earned increased during the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , versus that of the comparable   2015   periods due to the increased participation in the Endurance Quota Share Agreement, partially offset by the impact of non-renewals of other contracts. 
    
  See Note 2 of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
     Net Loss from Derivative Instruments 
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our in-force derivative contracts included the 2016 Inward ILW Swap and the 2016 Outward ILW Swaps. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , our in-force derivative contracts included the 2015 Inward ILW Swap and the 2015 Outward ILW Swap.

     Table of Contents  

During each of the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $0.5 million   of net loss from derivative instruments. During each of the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized   $0.3 million   of net loss from derivative instruments. 
    
  See Note 3 of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Loss and LAE 
    
  The following table summarizes the components of our consolidated loss and LAE incurred and our loss and LAE ratios for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we established   $2.9 million   and   $10.1 million   of loss and LAE reserves, respectively, for estimated losses incurred during such periods primarily driven by the catastrophe events summarized in the following table together with reported attritional losses and IBNR reserves.  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we established   $1.2 million   and   $2.6 million   of net loss and LAE reserves, respectively, for estimated losses incurred during such periods, nearly all of which constituted IBNR reserves.  There were no individually significant loss events that impacted us during the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  . 

(1) Other loss events for both the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   included the Texas hailstorm, Japanese earthquake and Netherlands hail events for which the losses were individually below $1.0 million. 
    
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $0.3 million   of favorable loss and LAE reserve development and in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   we recognized   $0.3 million   of adverse loss and LAE reserve development for estimated losses incurred during   2014   and   2015  .  In addition, during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized   $0.2 million   of adverse loss and LAE reserve development and in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized   $0.3 million   of favorable loss and LAE reserve development for estimated losses incurred during   2014  . 
    
  Reinsurance Acquisition Costs 
    
  The following table summarizes our consolidated reinsurance acquisition costs and our reinsurance acquisition cost ratios for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Our reinsurance acquisition costs, which we normally recognize over the underlying risk period of the related contracts, include commissions, brokerage costs, fronting fees, premium taxes and excise taxes, in each case, when applicable, and are  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

normally a set percentage of gross premiums written. Our reinsurance acquisition costs may also include profit commissions, which are paid by reinsurers to ceding companies in the event of favorable loss experience. 
    
  Our reinsurance acquisition costs relating to commissions, brokerage costs, fronting fees and related costs increased in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , versus the comparable   2015   periods, primarily reflecting the higher concentration of earned premium from the Endurance Quota Share Agreement which maintains a higher acquisition cost. Our profit commissions incurred, which fluctuate based on our loss experience, were lower in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   2015   as a result of the higher level of loss events impacting our results.  
    
  General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  The following table summarizes our consolidated general and administrative expenses and our general and administrative expense ratios for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

See Note 7 of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the nature of the expenses that we incur pursuant to the agreements with the Manager and other affiliates of Endurance. 
    
  The expenses we have incurred pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement and Administrative Services Agreement have remained consistent from period to period.  During the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   nil   and   $0.4 million   of performance fees pursuant to the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement.  The absence of a performance fee expense in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was due to our financial results not meeting the level of return necessary to trigger a performance fee in the period. 
    
  Our public company expenses incurred during the periods presented consisted of director fees, corporate insurance premiums, audit fees, share-based compensation and other expenses associated with being a publicly traded company.  The decrease in these expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 is due to higher legal and professional fees in the prior period in connection with the May 2015 amendment and renewal of the 2014 Credit Agreement.  
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  During each of the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred interest expense on our borrowings under the Credit Agreements of less than   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million   respectively.  
    
     Income Taxes 
    
  We were not subject to income taxes in any jurisdiction during the periods presented. 
    
  Summary Financial Results 
    
  Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016    
    
  We ended the   third   quarter of   2016   with a fully converted book value per Common Share ("FCBVPS") of   $20.44  , an increase of   1.9%   for the quarter and   5.5%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   after taking into account dividends declared on Common Shares during the periods.  Our net income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $10.3 million  , which was impacted by a number of loss events in the second quarter.  Our GAAP combined ratio was   63.5%   and   66.4%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.

Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  We ended the   third   quarter of   2015   with a FCBVPS of   $20.80  , an increase of 2.5% for the quarter and 8.4% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   after taking into account dividends declared on Common Shares during the periods. The increase in our book value per Common Share, after taking into account dividends declared, was the result of strong underwriting results driven by a lack of major catastrophe loss activity and was evidenced by net income of   $15.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Our GAAP combined ratio was   50.8%   and   46.1%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Book Value Per Common Share 
    
  The following table presents our computation of book value per Common Share ("BVPS") and FCBVPS as of selected balance sheet dates:  

(1)         Computed as the increase in FCBVPS after taking into account dividends declared on Common Shares and RSUs of $0.30, $2.14 and $2.14 during the three,   nine   and twelve month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Our computations of FCBVPS and the increase in FCBVPS are non-GAAP measures which we believe are important to our investors, analysts and other interested parties who benefit from having an objective and consistent basis for comparison with other companies within our industry.  However, these measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  Subsequent Event 
    
  On October 7 and 8, 2016, Hurricane Matthew traveled alongside the southeastern coast of the United States, ultimately making landfall in South Carolina. To date, reported claims as a result of this storm have been limited. Accordingly, 
  while losses emanating from the storm cannot be accurately estimated at this time, the Company may need to establish 
  appropriate loss reserves related to Hurricane Matthew in the fourth quarter of 2016, which may have a negative impact on 
  its results of operations. 
    
  Exposure Management 
    
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1A   "Risk Factors"   included in the   2015   Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, as filed with the SEC, in particular the risk factor entitled   "Our stated catastrophe and enterprise-wide risk management exposures are based on estimates and judgments which are subject to significant uncertainties." 
    
  The Manager monitors our net exposure to any one catastrophe loss event in any single zone within certain broadly defined major catastrophe zones. On June 1, 2016 our projected net exposures by zone were in compliance with our underwriting guidelines. Namely, our projected net exposure to any one zone was below 50% of our projected shareholders' equity at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  These broadly defined major catastrophe zones are currently defined as follows:

  Single Event Losses 
    
  For certain defined catastrophe region and peril combinations, the Manager assesses the probability and likely magnitude of losses using a combination of industry third-party models, proprietary models and underwriting judgment. The Manager attempts to model the projected net impact from a single event, taking into account contributions from property catastrophe reinsurance (including retrocessional business), property pro-rata reinsurance and event-linked derivative securities, offset by the net benefit of any reinsurance or derivative protections we purchase and the benefit of premiums. 
    
  There is no single standard methodology or set of assumptions utilized industry-wide in estimating property catastrophe losses. As a result, it may be difficult to accurately compare estimates of risk exposure among different insurance and reinsurance companies due to, among other things, underwriting judgment, differences in modeling, modeling assumptions, portfolio composition and concentrations, and selected event scenarios. 
    
  The table that follows details our projected net impact from single event losses as of June 1, 2016 for selected zones at specified return periods using industry-recognized third-party vendor models. It is important to note that each catastrophe model we use contains its own assumptions as to the frequency and severity of loss events, and results may vary significantly from model to model. 
    
  Since the Manager utilizes a combination of third-party models, its own proprietary models and underwriting judgment to project the net impact from single event losses, our internal projections may be higher or lower than those presented in the table below: 
    
  Net Impact from Single Event Losses at Specified Return Periods 

(1)   A "100-year" return period can also be referred to as the 1.0% occurrence exceedance probability ("OEP"), meaning there is an estimated 1.0% chance in any given year that this level will be exceeded.  A "250-year" return period can also be referred to as the 0.4% OEP, meaning there is an estimated 0.4% chance in any given year that this level will be exceeded. 
    
  On June 1, 2016 our projected single event loss exposures were within our underwriting guidelines. Namely, the projected net impact from any one catastrophe loss event (excluding earthquake) at the 1 in 100 year return period for any one zone did not exceed 35% of our projected shareholders' equity at   September 30, 2016  , and the projected net impact from any one earthquake loss event at the 1 in 250 year return period for any zone did not exceed 35% of our projected shareholders' equity at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Our projections of the net impact from single event losses may vary considerably within a particular territory depending on the specific characteristics of the event. 
    
  Given the limited availability of reliable historical data, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the accuracy of any catastrophe model, especially when contemplating longer return periods. 
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

Our single event loss estimates represent snapshots as of June 1, 2016. The composition of our in-force portfolio may change materially at any time due to the acceptance of new policies, losses incurred, the expiration of existing policies and changes in our ceded reinsurance and derivative protections. There were no material changes made to the composition of our in-force portfolio from June 1, 2016 to   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  The Company has no operations of its own and relies on dividends and distributions from Blue Capital Re to pay its expenses and to repay its outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreements, as well as to fund the payment of any dividends to its shareholders or share repurchase programs. The ability of Blue Capital Re to pay dividends is dependent on its ability to meet the requirements of applicable Bermuda law and regulations. Under Bermuda law, Blue Capital Re may not declare or pay a dividend to the Company if there are reasonable grounds for believing that Blue Capital Re is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or the realizable value of Blue Capital Re's assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts. Further, Blue Capital Re, as a regulated insurance company in Bermuda, is subject to additional regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. As of   September 30, 2016  , Blue Capital Re could pay a dividend or return additional paid-in capital totaling approximately $12.4 million (  December 31, 2015     $50.6 million) without prior regulatory approval based upon the Bermuda insurance and corporate regulations. 
    
  The primary sources of cash for the Company's operating subsidiaries are capital contributions, premium collections, issuances of and net income from insurance-linked securities and reinsurance recoveries.  The primary uses of cash for the Company's operating subsidiaries are payments of loss and LAE reserves, reinsurance acquisition costs, general and administrative expenses, ceded reinsurance, purchases of and net losses from insurance-linked securities and dividends and distributions. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we held   $7.8 million   of cash and cash equivalents of which: (i)   $3.1 million   was pledged to trust accounts established for the benefit of third parties; and (ii)   $4.7 million   represented unencumbered cash on hand. 
    
  On May 6, 2016, the Company entered into a credit facility (the "2016 Credit Facility") with Endurance Investment Holdings Ltd. (the "Lender"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Endurance. The 2016 Credit Facility provides the Company with an unsecured   $20.0 million   revolving credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes and expires on September 30, 2018. The 2016 Credit Facility replaces the 2014 Credit Agreement and related Guarantee Agreement which expired on April 29, 2016.  Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility bear interest, set at the time of the borrowing, at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus   150   basis points.  A one-time fee of   $20,000   was due to the Lender in connection with establishing the 2016 Credit Facility. The 2016 Credit Facility contains covenants that limit the Company s ability, among other things, to grant liens on its assets, sell assets, merge or consolidate, or incur debt. If the Company fails to comply with any these covenants, the Lender could revoke the facility and exercise remedies against the Company. In addition, in the event of a default in the performance of any of the agreements or covenants under certain management agreements with the Manager by the Company, the Lender has the right to terminate the 2016 Credit Facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all of its respective covenants associated with the Credit Facility. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility.  See Note 5 of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  On May 1, 2015, we renewed and amended our 364-day Credit Agreement (the "2014 Credit Agreement") which permitted us to borrow up to $20.0 million on a revolving basis for working capital and general corporate purposes. The 2014 Credit Agreement expired on April 29, 2016. 
    
  The 2014 Credit Agreement contained covenants that limited the Company's ability to, among other things, grant liens on its assets, sell assets, merge or consolidate, incur debt and enter into certain transactions with affiliates.  The 2014 Credit Agreement also contained covenants that required: (i) the Company to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 22.5%; (ii) the Company to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of no less than 70% of its consolidated tangible net worth as of May 2, 2014 (the original closing date of the Credit Agreement); (iii) Endurance to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of less than 35.0%; (iv) Endurance to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of no less than $1.8 billion; and (v) each of Endurance's regulated insurance subsidiaries that has a claims paying rating from A.M. Best to maintain  
  
   24 

     Table of Contents  

a rating of at least "B++." If the Company or Endurance failed to comply with any of these covenants, the lender could have revoked the facility and exercised remedies against the Company or Endurance.   
    
  During the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , we declared: (i) a special dividend with respect to   2015   of $1.24 per Common Share and RSU, which was paid on March 15, 2016; (ii) a first quarter   2016   regular dividend of $0.30 per Common Share and RSU, which was paid on April 15, 2016; (iii) a second quarter 2016 regular dividend of $0.30 per Common Share and RSU, which was paid on July 15, 2016; and (iv) a third quarter 2016 regular dividend of $0.30 per Common Share and RSU, which was paid on October 14, 2016.  The total dollar amount of dividends paid during the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   was   $16.1 million  . 
    
  We intend to continue to distribute a minimum of 90% of annual Distributable Income by making quarterly dividend payments for each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, followed by either repurchases of Common Shares or payment of a fourth "special" dividend after the end of our fiscal year.  Any future determination to pay dividends or repurchase Common Shares will remain at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon many factors, including: (i) our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including our ability to generate cash flow in excess of our expenses) and capital requirements; (ii) general business conditions, (iii) legal, tax and regulatory limitations; (iv) contractual prohibitions and other restrictions; (v) trading price of the Company's Common Shares as compared to the Company's book value per share; and (vi) any other factors that the Board deems relevant. We currently expect that our dividends will be subject to customary dividend tax treatment in the U.S., but if our total dividends paid during any given year exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits as of the end of such year (determined under U.S. tax principles), a portion of our dividends paid in that year will be treated: (i) first, as a nontaxable return of capital, to the extent of a shareholder s tax basis in Common Shares (on a dollar-for-dollar basis); and (ii) subsequently, as capital gain. 
    
  Capital Resources 
    
  Our total shareholders' equity (or total capital) was   $179.2 million   and   $187.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Our total capital decreased during the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as a result of the declaration of   $18.8 million   in dividends to holders of Common Shares and RSUs which was partially offset by net income of   $10.3 million   and equity compensation expense for RSUs of $0.1 million. 
    
  We do not consider any short-term borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreements to be a component of our capital structure. 
    
  We may need to raise additional capital in the future, by issuing new debt, equity or hybrid securities, in order to enable us to, among other things: write new business; enter into other reinsurance opportunities; cover or pay losses; manage working capital requirements; repurchase Common Shares; respond to, or comply with, any changes in the capital requirements, if any, that the BMA or other regulatory bodies may require; acquire new businesses; or invest in existing businesses. We intend to rely on future offerings of Common Shares to raise additional equity capital; however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully raise additional capital. In the event that we incur indebtedness for any of these purposes or other purposes, we intend to limit our borrowing to an amount no greater than 50% of our shareholders' equity at the time of the borrowing. However, subject to the approval of the Board, we may borrow an amount in excess of 50% of our shareholders  equity at the time of the borrowing. 
    
  The issuance of any new debt, equity or hybrid securities might be on terms and conditions that are unfavorable to our shareholders. Any new issuances of equity or hybrid securities could include the issuance of securities with rights, preferences and privileges that are senior or otherwise superior to those of Common Shares and could be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Any new debt securities may contain terms that materially restrict our operations, including our ability to distribute cash to our shareholders.  In addition, if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms, or at all, our business could be adversely affected. 
    
  Collateral Requirements and Restrictions 
    
  Each of the reinsurance contracts that Blue Capital Re writes is required to be fully-collateralized by cash and cash equivalents or funds held by reinsurance companies. This collateral is not available to Blue Capital Re for any other purpose until the expiration of the applicable reinsurance contract (or, in the event of a covered loss, the resolution of such loss under the applicable contract).

Each industry loss warranty contract that Blue Capital Re ILS issues is required to be fully-collateralized by cash and cash equivalents. This collateral is not available to Blue Capital Re ILS for any other purpose until the expiration of the applicable industry loss warranty contract (or, in the event of a covered loss, the resolution of such loss under the contract). 
    
  Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreements.  See Note 5 of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  The Company and its operating subsidiaries have entered into the Investment Management Agreement, the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement and the Administrative Services Agreement with the Manager and the 2016 Credit Facility with the Lender. 
    
  Investment Management Agreement  .  Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, we are obligated to pay the Manager a management fee (the "Management Fee") equal to 1.5% of our average total shareholders' equity (as defined in the Investment Management Agreement) per annum, calculated and payable in arrears in cash each quarter (or part thereof) that the Investment Management Agreement is in effect. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total shareholders' equity was   $179.2 million  .  Assuming that our average total shareholders' equity remains at this level in future periods, we would expect to pay the Manager a Management Fee of approximately   $2.7 million   per year pursuant to this agreement. 
    
  Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement  .    Pursuant to the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement, we are obligated to pay the Manager a performance fee (the "Performance Fee") which is equal to 20% of our pre-tax, pre-Performance Fee income over a hurdle amount (as defined in the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement) and payable in arrears in cash each quarter (or part thereof) that such agreement is in effect. 
    
  Since the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement is dependent on our future performance, we are unable to determine the amount of Performance Fees we would expect to pay the Manager in future periods pursuant to this agreement. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we incurred   $0.4 million   in Performance Fees pursuant to this agreement. 
    
  Administrative Services Agreement  .    Pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement, we are obligated to reimburse the Manager for various fees, expenses and other costs in connection with the services provided under the terms of this agreement, including the services of our CFO, modeling software licenses and finance, legal and administrative support. 
    
  We currently expect to pay the Manager approximately   $0.6 million   per year in future periods pursuant to this agreement. 
    
  Credit Facility Agreement.   The 2016 Credit Facility provides the Company with an unsecured   $20.0 million   revolving credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes and expires on September 30, 2018.  
    
  Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility will bear interest, set at the time of the borrowing, at a rate equal to the LIBOR rate plus   150   basis points.  Upon consummation of the 2016 Credit Facility, a one-time fee of   $20,000   was due to the Lender in connection with the set-up of the facility.  
    
  Certain Termination Provisions Associated with the Foregoing Agreements  .    We may not terminate the Investment Management Agreement, the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement or the Administrative Services Agreement for five years after the completion of the IPO, whether or not the Manager s performance results are satisfactory. Upon any termination or non-renewal of either of the Investment Management Agreement or the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement (other than for a material breach by, or the insolvency of, the Manager), we must pay a one-time termination fee to the Manager equal to 5% of our GAAP shareholders' equity, calculated as of the most recently completed quarter prior to the date of termination. In addition, if the Investment Management Agreement, the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement, or the Administrative Services Agreement is terminated for any reason, the Lender may terminate the 2016 Credit Facility and we would be required to repay any outstanding amounts under the 2016 Credit Facility. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , if we were to terminate either the Investment Management Agreement or the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement, we would be required to pay the Manager a one-time termination fee of approximately   $9.0 million  .

Neither the Company nor its operating subsidiaries had any commitments for operating leases or capital expenditures at   September 30, 2016   and neither the Company nor its operating subsidiaries expect any material expenditures of this type during the next 12 months or for the foreseeable future. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were not subject to any off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe are material to our investors. 
    
  Cash Flows 

We experienced a net increase of     $1.7 million   and a net decrease of   $5.7 million   in our cash and cash equivalents during the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our premium collections, net releases of cash and cash equivalents from trusts established by Blue Water Re and cash inflows from other operating activities exceeded our payments of general and administrative expenses by   $30.8 million  . We also paid   $16.1 million   in dividends to holders of Common Shares and RSUs and repaid   $13.0 million   under the Credit Agreement during the period. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , our premium collections and cash inflows from other operating activities exceeded our transfers of cash and cash equivalents into trusts established by Blue Water Re and payments of general and administrative expenses by   $4.4 million  . We also paid   $11.1 million   in dividends to holders of Common Shares and RSUs and borrowed an incremental $1.0 million under the 2014 Credit Agreement during the period. 
    
  Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  Our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported and disclosed amounts of our assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are: (i) our loss and LAE reserves; and (ii) our written and earned reinsurance premiums.  In addition, we qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act"), which significantly affects certain of our reporting requirements. 
    
  Our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Loss and LAE Reserves 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   our best estimate for gross and net unpaid loss and LAE reserves was   $10.3 million  , with IBNR representing approximately 31% of such reserves. 
    
  Our reserving methodology does not lend itself well to a statistical calculation of a range of estimates surrounding the best point estimate of our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Due to the low frequency and high severity nature of claims within much of our business, our reserving methodology principally involves arriving at a specific point estimate for the ultimate expected loss on a contract by contract basis, and our aggregate loss reserves are the sum of the individual loss reserves established. 
    
  Further information regarding our loss and LAE reserve estimates is included in the section entitled   "Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"   in Item 7   "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"   included in the   2015   Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC.

Written and Earned Reinsurance Premiums 
    
  During the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we wrote   $34.5 million   and   $33.6 million   in reinsurance premiums, respectively, and earned reinsurance premiums of   $32.1 million   and   $29.0 million  , respectively. 
    
  For reinsurance contracts which incorporate minimum premium amounts, we typically write the entire ultimate premium at inception, and earn the associated premium after the premium is written over the term of the contract.  For reinsurance contracts which do not incorporate minimum premium amounts, we typically write the premium over the term of the contract, and earn the associated premium in the same periods that the premium is written. 
    
  Subsequent adjustments of written premium, based on reports of actual premium by the ceding companies, or revisions in estimates of ultimate premium, are recorded in the period in which they are determined. Such adjustments are generally determined after the associated risk periods have expired, in which case the premium adjustments are fully written when earned. 
    
  Detailed information regarding our written and earned reinsurance premiums is included in the section entitled   "Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"    in Item 7   "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"    included in the   2015   Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC. 
    
  JOBS Act 
    
  The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an emerging growth company.  As an emerging growth company, we are electing not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision not to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. 
    
  We have also determined that, as an emerging growth company, we will not: (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b); (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; or (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of our CEO's compensation to median employee compensation. 
    
  We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1.0 billion (as indexed for inflation); (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the IPO; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a "large accelerated filer," as defined under the Exchange Act. 
    
  Since we have elected not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards, our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements may not be comparable to those emerging growth companies that have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act. 

Item 3.               Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  . 
    
  Refer to the   2015   Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC, and in particular Item 7A -   "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk."    As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes to our market risks as described in the   2015   Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC.

Item 4.               Controls and Procedures  . 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  a)    Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company's CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act. 
  (b)    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the Company's   third   fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.                     Legal Proceedings  . 
    
  We may be party to various legal proceedings generally arising in the ordinary course of our business.

The Proposed Merger between Sompo Holdings, Inc. and Endurance could disrupt our business. 
    
  Endurance announced on October 5, 2016 that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Proposed Merger") pursuant to which it will be acquired by Sompo Holdings, Inc., subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. 
    
  We rely on affiliates of Endurance to provide us with accounting, secretarial, internal audit, administrative and other services that are integral to our day-to-day operations.  In addition, our CEO and our CFO are employees of affiliates of Endurance and their services are provided to us through an administrative services agreement with the Manager. 
    
  Our relationship with Endurance and its affiliates, may be impacted by the Proposed Merger and any changes in our relationship with Endurance as a result of the Proposed Merger could significantly impact our business.
