  Note 1   Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying condensed and consolidated financial statements of Allegion plc, an Irish public limited company, and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Allegion" or the "Company"), reflect the consolidated operations of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") interim reporting requirements. Accordingly, the accompanying condensed and consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for full financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Allegion Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed and consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, necessary to state fairly the consolidated unaudited results for the interim periods presented.  

Note  2   Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs." ASU 2015-03 amends existing guidance to require the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of as an asset. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. As further reflected in Note 8 to the Condensed and Consolidated Financial Statements, we retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-03, the Company reclassified $  22.3 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs from Other noncurrent assets to Long term debt within its previously reported Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.  
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Business Combinations (Topic 802): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments." ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Prior to the issuance of the standard, entities were required to retrospectively apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The ASU was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company made immaterial measurement-period adjustments related to a business combination from September 2015 during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The impact of ASU 2015-16 on these adjustments did not have a material impact on the Condensed and Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU 2016-09 changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 on October 1, 2016. As a result, during the fourth quarter we expect to recognize a year-to-date 2016 excess tax benefit approximately $3.0 million against income tax expense rather than additional paid-in capital. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (ASC 606).  ASC 606 is a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers.  The model is based on changes in contract assets (rights to receive consideration) and liabilities (obligations to provide a good or perform a service).  Revenue is recognized based on the satisfaction of performance obligations, which occurs when control of a good or service transfers to a customer.  ASC 606 contains expanded disclosure requirements relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Entities may use a full retrospective approach or report the cumulative effect as of the date of adoption. This guidance will be effective for the Company January 1, 2018. The FASB has also issued the following standards which clarify ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as the original standard: ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  The Company has completed a high-level assessment of the new

    ALLEGION PLC 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

standard s impact and is currently performing a technical assessment of all customer contracts.  The Company is still evaluating which approach to use upon adoption.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)." ASU 2016-02 requires the identification of arrangements that should be accounted for as leases by lessees. In general, for lease arrangements exceeding a twelve month term, these arrangements must now be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee. Under ASU 2016-02, a right-of-use asset and lease obligation will be recorded for all leases, whether operating or financing, while the income statement will reflect lease expense for operating leases and amortization/interest expense for financing leases. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted.  ASU 2016-05 is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented with various optional practical expedients. The Company is assessing what impact ASU 2016-02 will have on the Condensed and Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments."  The new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments.  The ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is assessing what impact ASU 2016-13 will have on the Condensed and Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Clarification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." The objective of ASU 2016-15 is to eliminate the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, by adding or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. The ASU will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, unless deemed impracticable, in which case, prospective application is permitted. The Company is assessing what impact ASU 2016-15 will have on the Condensed and Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Note 3   Inventories 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method.   
  The major classes of inventory were as follows: 

5 

Note 4   Goodwill 
    
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

Note 5   Intangible Assets 
  The gross amount of the Company s intangible assets and related accumulated amortization were as follows: 

Intangible asset amortization expense was   $15.5 million   and   $6.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Future estimated amortization expense on existing intangible assets in each of the next five years amounts to approximately $  19.8 million   for full year 2016, $  20.0 million   for 2017, $  19.9 million   for 2018, $  19.9 million   for 2019, and $  19.9 million   for 2020.  

Note 6   Acquisitions 
    
  2016 
    
  In June   2016   the Company acquired 100% of Trelock GmbH, a portable safety and security provider, and certain affiliated companies.  
    
  2015 
    
  In 2015, the Company completed one investment and five acquisitions:  

6 

Total consideration paid for the acquisitions was   $511.3 million   (net of cash acquired). The allocation of the aggregate purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisitions described above is as follows:   

The acquisitions are accounted for as business combinations. 
    
  The following unaudited pro forma financial information for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   reflects the consolidated results of operations of the Company as if the acquisitions had taken place on January 1, 2014.  

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   the Company incurred   $5.1 million   and   $7.1 million   of acquisition related costs. These expenses are included in Selling and administrative expenses in the Condensed and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. For pro forma purposes, the expenses were assumed to have been incurred on January 1, 2014. Pro forma Net earnings (loss) attributable to Allegion plc in the table above has been adjusted to reflect the costs in the assumed acquisition period.  
    
  The Company s historical financial information was adjusted to give effect to the pro forma events that were directly attributable to the acquisitions. This unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of results of operations that would have occurred had the pro forma events taken place on the date indicated or the future consolidated results of operations of the combined company. 

7 

The unaudited pro forma financial information has been calculated after applying the Company's accounting policies and adjusting the results of the acquired companies to reflect the additional amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to intangible assets had been applied from January 1, 2014 with the consequential tax effects.  Additionally, interest related to the issuance of $300 million of senior notes and the borrowing of $100 million on the revolving facility has been included in the pro forma results above as if the debt was outstanding as of January 1, 2014. For purposes of calculating interest on the additional debt amounts, the Company has assumed the total amount is outstanding for all pro forma periods presented.  
    
  The following financial information reflects revenue and results of operations of the acquisitions for both 2015 and 2016 since their respective acquisition dates included in the Condensed and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as of the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.   

Note 7   Divestitures 
    
  As previously disclosed, the Company sold a majority stake of Bocom Wincent Technologies Co., Ltd. ("Bocom") in the fourth quarter of 2015. Bocom operates a security system integration business exclusively in China and provides services primarily to Chinese governments and government agencies. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company was to receive consideration of up to   $75 million   based on the future cash collection performance of Bocom and additional payments of approximately   $8.3 million   related to working capital transferred with the sale. Additionally, the Company has retained 15% of the shares of Bocom.  In the third quarter of 2015 , the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of   $80.6 million   (  $84.4 million   after-tax) to write the carrying value of Bocom s assets and liabilities down to their estimated fair value less costs to complete the transaction. 
    
  As part of the Company's quarterly assessment of the collectibility of the above amounts, the receivable was considered impaired. It was determined during this evaluation that certain unfavorable events occurred related to the Bocom business requiring an impairment of the original consideration and working capital transfer amounts that were recorded at the time of the sale. Prior to the impairment, the receivable balance was   $85.9 million  .  A charge of   $81.4 million   (net of tax) was recorded, reducing the carrying value of the receivable to   $4.5 million   as of September 30, 2016.  Also, the Company accrued certain contractual obligations of   $3.0 million   that were uncertain at the time of the sale. The total charge recorded as Loss on divestitures within the Statement of Comprehensive Income was   $84.4 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company does not expect to incur any material charges in future periods related to the Bocom business.  
    
  The Company currently estimates the fair value of the consideration to be   $4.5 million  , which is classified within Other noncurrent assets within the Condensed and Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the receivable was estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows. The assumptions used in this estimate are considered unobservable inputs. Fair value measurements that utilize significant unobservable inputs are categorized as Level 3 measurements under the accounting guidance. 
    
  In the third quarter of 2015, the Company sold its majority ownership in its Venezuela operation to Venezuelan investors and recorded a non-cash charge of   $26.1 million  , which primarily represents cumulative currency translation adjustments.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

Note 8   Debt and Credit Facilities 
    
  At   September 30,   long-term debt and other borrowings consisted of the following: 

Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
    
  The Company has credit facilities consisting of a   $938.4 million   Term Loan Facility due in 2020 (the "Term Loan A Facility") and  a   $500.0 million   Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the "Revolver") maturing in 2020. The Company refers to these credit facilities as its "Senior Secured Credit Facilities."  
    
  The applicable margin for LIBOR rate borrowings ranges from   1.375%   to   1.875%   and the applicable margin for base rate borrowings ranges from 0.375% to 0.875%, in each case depending on the corporate credit or family rating. The Revolver and the Term Loan A Facility mature on October 15, 2020.  
    
  Outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities currently accrue interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin.  The margin for the Term Loan A Facility borrowings was   1.375%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  To manage the Company's exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR rates, the Company has interest rate swaps for   $300.0 million   of the Company's variable rate Term Loan A Facility. See Note 9 for more information on interest rate swaps. 
  The Company repaid   $35.2 million   of principal on its Term Loan A Facility during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   in accordance with the terms of its Senior Secured Credit Facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and had   $18.5 million   of letters of credit outstanding.  Allegion plc is primary borrower under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.  
    
  Senior Notes 
    
  A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company has issued   $300.0 million   of   5.75%   senior notes due 2021 (the "2021 Senior Notes"). The 2021 Senior Notes accrue interest at the rate of   5.75%   per annum, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2021 Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2021. 
    
  In September 2015, Allegion plc issued   $300.0 million   of   5.875%   senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 Senior Notes"). The 2023 Senior Notes accrue interest at the rate of   5.875%   per annum, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2016. The 2023 Senior Notes mature on September 15, 2023. 
    
  The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings was   2.4%   under the Term Loan A Facility (including the effect of interest rate swaps) at   September 30, 2016  ,   5.75%   under the 2021 Senior Notes and   5.875%   under the 2023 Senior Notes.      

Note 9   Financial Instruments 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Company uses various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, to manage the risks associated with interest and currency rate exposures. These financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. 
  
    9 

    ALLEGION PLC 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction, a cash flow hedge of a recognized asset or liability, or as an undesignated derivative. The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identification of the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivative instruments that are designated as hedges to specific assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions. 
    
  The fair market value of derivative instruments is determined through market-based valuations and may not be representative of the actual gains or losses that will be recorded when these instruments mature due to future fluctuations in the markets in which they are traded. 
    
  The Company assesses at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. To the extent the derivative is deemed to be a highly effective hedge, the fair market value changes of the instrument are recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
    
  Any ineffective portion of a derivative instrument s change in fair value is recorded in Net earnings in the period of change. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective, or it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the hedging relationship will be undesignated and any future gains and losses on the derivative instrument will be recorded in Net earnings. 
  Currency Hedging Instruments 
  The gross notional amount of the Company s currency derivatives was   $299.8 million   and   $269.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , a gain of   $1.0 million   and a gain of   $1.7 million  , net of tax, respectively, were included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the fair value of the Company s currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. The amount expected to be reclassified into Net earnings over the next twelve months is a gain of   $1.0 million  . The actual amounts that will be reclassified to Net earnings may vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. Gains and losses associated with the Company s currency derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in Net earnings as changes in fair value occur. At   September 30, 2016  , the maximum term of the Company s currency derivatives was less than one year. 
  Interest Rate Swaps 
  In June 2014, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate paid during the contract period for up to   $300.0 million   of the Company's variable rate   $938.4 million   Term Loan A Facility. Swaps with notional amounts totaling   $275.0 million   are effective January 2015 and expire in September 2017 and swaps with notional amounts totaling   $25.0 million   are effective January 2015 and expire in December 2016.  In February 2016, the Company entered into additional forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling   $250.0 million  , which become effective September 2017 and expire in September 2020. 
  These interest rate swaps met the criteria to be accounted for as cash flow hedges of variable rate interest payments. Consequently, the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps were recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $2.2 million   of losses were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these interest rate swaps and    $1.0 million   of losses are expected to be reclassified into Interest expense over the next twelve months. 
    
  The fair values of derivative instruments included within the Condensed and Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

  Concentration of Credit Risk 
    
  The counterparties to the Company s forward contracts and swaps consist of a number of investment grade major international financial institutions. The Company could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties. However, the credit ratings and the concentration of risk in these financial institutions are monitored on a continuous basis and present no significant credit risk to the Company. 

Note 10   Pensions and Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions 
    
  The Company sponsors several U.S. defined benefit and defined contribution plans covering substantially all of its U.S. employees. Additionally, the Company has non-U.S. defined benefit and defined contribution plans covering eligible non-U.S. employees. Postretirement benefits, other than pensions, provide healthcare benefits, and in some instances, life insurance benefits for certain eligible employees. 
  Pension Plans 
  The noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering non-collectively bargained U.S. employees provide benefits on an average pay formula while most plans for collectively bargained U.S. employees provide benefits on a flat dollar benefit formula.  The non-U.S. pension plans generally provide benefits based on earnings and years of service. The Company also maintains additional other supplemental plans for officers and other key employees.

The components of the Company s net periodic pension benefit costs for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30   were as follows: 

Beginning in 2016, the Company elected to change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost to a full yield-curve approach. Historically, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components using a single weighted-average discount rate, rounded to the nearest 25 basis points, derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Under the new approach, the Company applied discounting using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve to discount the cash flows used to measure the benefit obligation. These spot rates align to each of the projected benefit obligations and service cost cash flows. This change was made to better align the projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates to provide a better estimate of service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs. This change was considered a change in estimate and was accounted for on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2016.  This change did not have a material impact on 2016 pension expense.  
  The Company made employer contributions of   $6.7 million   and   $0.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   to its defined benefit pension plans. Additional contributions of approximately   $3.6 million   are expected during the remainder of 2016.  
  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions 
    
  The Company sponsors several postretirement plans that provide for healthcare benefits, and in some instances, life insurance benefits that cover certain eligible retired employees. The Company funds postretirement benefit obligations principally on a pay as you go basis. Generally, postretirement health benefits are contributory with contributions adjusted annually. Life insurance plans for retirees are primarily noncontributory.

Note 11   Fair Value Measurement 
  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  Fair value measurements are based on a framework that utilizes the inputs market participants use to determine the fair value of an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize those inputs. The fair value hierarchy is comprised of three levels that are described below: 
             
    Level 1   Inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2   Inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
                
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs based on little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. 
     The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value at   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value at   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

The Company determines the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities using the following methodologies: 
             
    Marketable securities     These securities include investments in publicly traded stock of non-U.S. companies held by non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Company. The fair value is obtained for the securities based on observable market prices quoted on public stock exchanges. 
                
    Foreign currency contracts     These instruments include foreign currency contracts for non-functional currency balance sheet exposures. The fair value of the foreign currency contracts are determined based on a pricing model that uses spot rates and forward prices from actively quoted currency markets that are readily accessible and observable. 
                
    Interest rate swaps     These instruments include forward-starting interest rate swap contracts for up to   $300.0 million   of the Company's variable rate debt. Refer to Note 9 for more information. The fair value of the derivative instruments are determined based on quoted prices for the Company's swaps, which are not considered an active market. 
                
    Deferred compensation plans   - These include obligations related to deferred compensation adjusted for market performance. The fair value is obtained based on observable market prices quoted on public exchanges for similar instruments. 
                
    Debt     These securities are recorded at cost and include senior notes maturing through   2023  .  The fair value of the long-term debt instruments is obtained based on observable market prices quoted on public exchanges for similar instruments. 
     The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings are a reasonable estimate of their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. 
    
  These methodologies used by the Company to determine the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   are the same as those used at   December 31, 2015  .  There have been no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 categories.

Compensation Expense 
    
  Share-based compensation expense relates to continuing operations and is included in selling and administrative expenses. The expenses recognized for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30   were as follows: 

Stock Options/RSUs 
    
  Eligible participants may receive (i) stock options, (ii) RSUs or (iii) a combination of both stock options and RSUs.  Grants issued during the   nine   months ended   September 30   were as follows: 

The fair value of each of the Company's stock option and RSU awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the required service period, which is generally the   3  -year vesting period. However, for stock options and RSUs granted to retirement eligible employees, the Company recognizes expense for the fair value at the grant date. 
    
  The average fair value of the stock options granted is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  The following assumptions were used during the   nine   months ended   September 30  : 

Expected volatility is based on the weighted average of the implied volatility of a group of the Company s peers due to the lack of trading history for the Company's ordinary shares.  The risk-free rate of return is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected life of the award.  Historical peer data is used to estimate forfeitures within the Company s valuation model.  The expected life of the Company s stock option awards is derived from the simplified approach based on the weighted average time to vest and the remaining contractual term and represents the period of time that awards are expected to be outstanding. 
    
  Performance Shares 
    
  The Company has a Performance Share Program for key employees. The program provides awards in the form of PSUs based on performance against pre-established objectives. The annual target award level is expressed as a number of the Company's ordinary

shares. All PSUs are settled in the form of ordinary shares unless deferred.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted PSUs with a maximum award level of approximately   0.1 million   shares. 
    
  In March 2014 and in February 2015 and 2016, the Company s Compensation Committee granted PSUs that were based   50%   upon a performance condition, measured at each performance period by earnings per share ("EPS") growth, and   50%   upon a market condition, measured by the Company s relative total shareholder return ("TSR") as compared to the TSR of the industrial group of companies in the S P 400 Capital Goods Index over the one-year, two-year, and three-year performance periods.  The fair values of the market condition were estimated using a Monte Carlo Simulation approach in a risk-neutral framework based upon historical volatility, risk-free rates and correlation matrix. 
    
  Deferred Compensation 
    
  The Company allows key employees to defer a portion of their eligible compensation into a number of investment choices including its ordinary share equivalents. Any amounts invested in ordinary share equivalents will be settled in ordinary shares of the Company at the time of distribution. 

Note 14   Restructuring Activities

  2015 Italy Restructuring Plan

The above expenses primarily relate to severance charges. Restructuring charges relating to this plan were   $14.7 million   in 2015.  
    
  The Company incurred other non-qualified restructuring charges of   $3.2 million   and   $3.5 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   in conjunction with the other restructuring plans, which represent costs that are directly attributable to restructuring activities, but do not fall into the severance, exit or disposal category.

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   the Company recorded gains from the sale of marketable securities of   $12.4 million  , which is included in Other in the table above. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   earnings from equity method investments increased primarily due to a gain recognized by an investment in the first quarter of 2016 that is not expected to recur in future periods.  
    
  During the   three   months ended September 30, 2015 the Company recorded gains from the sale of marketable securities of   $1.4 million  , which is included in Other in the table above.  
    
  In February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced changes to its exchange rate system that included the launch of a new, market-based system called the Marginal Currency System, or  SIMADI.

Note 16   Income Taxes 
    
  The effective income tax rates for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   90.5%   and   (285.3)%  . The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was negatively impacted by   $84.4 million   (before and after-tax) of charges primarily due to the write-down of the carrying value of consideration receivable related to the September 2015 divestiture of our security system integration business in China. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was negatively impacted by   $106.7 million   (  $110.5 million   after-tax) of charges related to the divestiture for the Company s business in Venezuela and the divestiture of the Company s systems integration business in China, partially offset by the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions. 
     
  The effective income tax rates for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   26.5%   and   38.1%  . The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was negatively impacted by   $84.4 million   (before and after-tax) of charges primarily due to the write-down of the carrying value of consideration receivable related to the September 2015 divestiture of our security system integration business in China. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was negatively impacted by   $113.6 million   (  $117.0 million   after-tax) of charges related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, the divestiture of the Company s business in Venezuela and the divestiture of the Company s systems integration business in China, partially offset by the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions.

In connection with the Spin-off, the Company and Ingersoll Rand entered into a Tax Matters Agreement for the allocation of taxes. In the second quarter of 2016 we reached a settlement agreement on a competent authority matter. The Company remitted   $49.2 million   to Ingersoll Rand related to this competent authority matter during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Also as part of this competent authority matter, the Company recorded a   $48.7 million   Other current asset (net of tax on interest income accrued on the refund), which is due from the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency and related Canadian Provincial Tax Agencies.  The Company did not collect on the $48.7 million receivable during three months ended September 30, 2016, but expects to collect by December 31, 2016. 

Note 17   Earnings Per Share (EPS) 
    
  Basic EPS is calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Allegion plc by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted EPS is calculated after adjusting the denominator of the basic EPS calculation for the effect of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares, which in the Company s case, includes shares issuable under share-based compensation plans.  
    
  The following table summarizes the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30  : 

At   September 30, 2016  ,   0.2 million   stock options were excluded from the computation of weighted-average diluted shares outstanding because the effect of including these shares would have been anti-dilutive.  

Note 18   Business Segment Information 
    
  The Company classifies its businesses into the following   three   reportable segments based on industry and market focus: Americas, EMEIA and Asia Pacific. 
    
  Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that the Company s chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation, performance reviews, and compensation. For these reasons, the Company believes that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss. The Company s chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains, such as corporate charges and other special charges, from Operating income to arrive at a Segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base its operating decisions. The Company defines Segment operating margin as Segment operating income as a percentage of Net revenues.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

A summary of operations by reportable segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30   was as follows: 

Note 19   Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Company is involved in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental and product warranty matters. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in this note, management believes that any liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  The Company is dedicated to an environmental program to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, the Company is currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities.  The Company regularly evaluates its remediation programs and considers alternative remediation methods that are in addition to, or in replacement of, those currently utilized by the Company based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes.  Changes to the Company's remediation programs may result in increased expenses and increased environmental reserves.  
    
  The Company is sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and from time to time receives notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state authorities. It has also been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. For all such sites, there are other PRPs and, in most instances, the Company s involvement is minimal. 
    
  In estimating its liability, the Company has assumed it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based

on our understanding of the parties  financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. Additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future.  
    
  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company incurred $  1.8 million   and $  0.9 million   of expenses for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company incurred   $6.8 million   and   $3.2 million   of expenses for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has recorded reserves for environmental matters of $  17.2 million   and $  15.2 million  . Of the total reserve, $  2.9 million   and $  2.8 million   relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by the Company. Environmental reserves are classified as Accrued expenses and other current liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities based on their expected term. The Company's total current environmental reserve at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was $  4.0 million   and $  3.7 million  , and the remainder is classified as non-current. Given the evolving nature of environmental laws, regulations and technology, the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain. 
    
  Warranty Liability 
    
  Standard product warranty accruals are recorded at the time of sale and are estimated based upon product warranty terms and historical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its liabilities and will make adjustments as necessary based on known or anticipated warranty claims, or as new information becomes available.   
    
  The changes in the standard product warranty liability for the   nine   months ended   September 30   were as follows: 

Standard product warranty liabilities are classified as Accrued expenses and other current liabilities.

  Recent Developments 
    
  2016 and 2015 Acquisitions and Divestitures 
    
  In   2016  , we completed one business acquisition. In 2015, we completed six acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses and two divestitures:    

The incremental impact of the acquisitions and divestitures for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was a net increase in revenues of approximately $9.7 million and a net decrease in operating income of approximately $1.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The incremental impact of the acquisitions and divestitures for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was a net increase in revenues of approximately $64.0 million and a net increase in operating income of approximately $7.7 million compared to the same period in the prior year.

Results of Operations     Three months ended     September 30 

The discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in our results of operations for the periods presented. 
  Net Revenues 
  Net revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   6.7%  , or   $36.6 million  , compared with the same period in   2015  , which resulted from the following: 

The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by favorable volume, the acquisitions and divestitures discussed above, and improved pricing. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate movements due to the strengthening of the US dollar against currencies in EMEIA, primarily the British pound. 
  Operating Income/Margin 
  Operating income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $11.1 million   compared to the same period in   2015   and operating margin for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   to   20.9%   from   20.3%   for the same period in   2015   due to the following: 

34 

     Table of Contents  

Operating income and operating margin increased primarily due to favorable volume/product mix, pricing and productivity in excess of inflation, lower restructuring and acquisition costs compared to the prior year, and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. These increases were partially offset by increased investment spending and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.  
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   $  1.9 million   compared with the same period of   2015   primarily due to increased debt balances resulting from the issuance of the 2023 Senior Notes in 2015. 
  Loss on Divestitures 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we recorded an after tax charge of $84.4 million primarily due to the write-down of the carrying value of consideration receivable related to the September 2015 divestiture of our security system integration business in China. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 we entered an agreement to sell a majority stake in our security system integration business and recorded a pre-tax charge of $80.6 million ($84.4 million after tax charges) to write the carrying value of the assets and liabilities down to their estimated fair value less costs to complete the transaction.  During the three months ended September 30, 2015 we sold our majority ownership in our Venezuelan operation to Venezuelan investors.  As a result of the sale we recorded a non-cash charge of $26.1 million, which primarily represents cumulative currency translation adjustments. 
  Other (Income) Expense, Net 
  The components of Other (income) expense, net for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Other (income) expense, net for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was unfavorable   $3.6 million   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily the result of gains on marketable equity securities of $1.4 million and investment income of $1.2 million during 2015, which is included in Other in the table above, offset by favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  The effective income tax rates for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   90.5%   and   (285.3)%  .  The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was negatively impacted by $84.4 million (before and after-tax) of charges primarily due to the write-down of the carrying value of consideration receivable related to the September 2015 divestiture of our security system integration business in China. The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was negatively impacted by $106.7 million ($110.5 million after-tax) of charges related to the divestiture for our business in Venezuela and the divestiture of our system integration business in China, partially offset by favorable resolution to uncertain tax positions.

The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by higher volumes, improved pricing in all three business segments and the acquisitions and divestitures discussed above. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements due to the strengthening of the US dollar across various currencies.  
  Operating Income/Margin

In February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced changes to its exchange rate system that included the launch of a new, market-based system called the Marginal Currency System, or  SIMADI.   During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   we recorded a charge of $2.8 million in order to remeasure net monetary assets at the SIMADI rate and other unfavorable currency impacts.

Review of Business Segments 
    
  We operate in and report financial results for three segments: Americas, EMEIA, and Asia Pacific. These segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews company financial performance and makes operating decisions. 
    
  Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation, performance reviews, and compensation. For these reasons, we believe that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss. Our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains, such as corporate charges and other special charges from Operating income, to arrive at a Segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions. We define Segment operating margin as Segment operating income as a percentage of Net revenues. 
    
  The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations.

  Segment operating income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   $  1.5 million   and segment operating margin   increased   to   6.3%   from   0.9%   compared to the same period in   2015   due to the following: 

The increase was primarily related to the divestiture of our security system integration business in China, the impact of the acquisition of Milre in the third quarter of 2015, favorable volume/product mix, favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and restructuring costs in the prior year.  These increases were partially offset by unfavorable inflation in excess of pricing improvements and productivity and increased investment spending. 
    
  Segment operating income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by $  7.5 million   and segment operating margin   increased   to   5.0%   from   (4.1)%   compared to the same period in   2015   due to the following: 

The increase in operating income was primarily related to the divestiture of our security system integration business in China, the impact of the acquisition of Milre in the third quarter of 2015, favorable volume/product mix, pricing improvements and productivity in excess of inflation and restructuring costs in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and increased investment spending in the current year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Sources and uses of liquidity 
  
    43 

     Table of Contents  

Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities is used to invest in new product development and channel development, fund capital expenditures and fund working capital requirements and is expected to be adequate to service debt, pay any declared dividends and potentially fund some acquisitions and share repurchases. Our ability to fund these capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash provided by operating activities, and to access our borrowing facilities (including unused availability under our revolving line of credit) and capital markets. We believe that our future cash provided by operating activities, together with our access to cash on hand, unused availability under our revolving line of credit and access to capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs.  
    
  The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30  . For additional details, see the Condensed and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the condensed and consolidated financial statements. 

Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by continuing operating activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $52.4 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase net earnings and a decrease in the use of our working capital. 
    
  In connection with the Spin-off we entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Ingersoll-Rand plc for the allocation of taxes. In the second quarter of 2016, we reached a settlement agreement on a competent authority matter. We remitted   $49.2 million   to Ingersoll Rand related to this matter during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Also, as part of this competent authority matter, we recorded a   $48.7 million   Other current asset (net of tax on interest income accrued on the refund), which is due from the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency and related Canadian Provincial Tax Agencies.  We did not collect on the $48.7 million receivable during three months ended September 30, 2016, but expect to collect it by December 31, 2016. 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in continuing investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $485.1 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . The change in net cash used in investing activities is primarily due to a net reduction in cash payments related to acquisitions and investments in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $14.1 million in 2016 compared to $1.5 million of proceeds in the same period in 2015.  
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in continuing financing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $416.9 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . In the prior year, the company refinanced its credit facilities providing $380.0 million in net proceeds.  Proceeds from short-term borrowings decreased $11.8 million from the prior period and payments on long-term debt increased $29.2 million.  Cash provided by other financing activities increased $4.1 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year due to $9.0 million of debt issuance costs in the prior period compared to $0.3 million in 2016 primarily offset by an increase in dividends to ordinary shareholders of $34.5 million compared to $28.7 million in the same period in 2015.

     Table of Contents  

Capitalization 
    
  Borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt consisted of the following: 

The Term Loan Facility amortizes in quarterly installments, at the following rates per year: 5% in 2016, 5% in 2017, 5% in 2018, and 10% in each year thereafter, with the final installment due on October 15, 2020. We repaid $35.2 million on the Term Loan Facility as of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The 2021 Senior Notes are due in full on October 1, 2021 and the 2023 Senior Notes are due in full on September 15, 2023.  
    
  We have a 5-year,   $500.0 million   Revolver maturing on   October 15, 2020  . At   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and had   $18.5 million   of letters of credit outstanding.  
    
  We are required to comply with certain covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. We are required to comply with a maximum leverage ratio of 4.00 to 1.00 based on a ratio of total consolidated indebtedness, net of unrestricted cash up to $150 million, to consolidated EBITDA. Additionally, we are required to have a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 4.00 to 1.00 based on a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense, net of interest income. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with these covenants. The indenture to our senior notes and the senior secured credit facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.   
    
  Pensions 
    
  Our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. We seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. Global asset allocation decisions are based on a dynamic approach whereby a plan's allocation to fixed income assets increases progressively over time. We monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance. 
    
  We monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis. None of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets. For further details on pension plan activity, see Note 10 to the Condensed and Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  For a further discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our condensed and consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgments in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well  
  
    45 

     Table of Contents  

as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from estimates. 
    
  Management believes there have been no significant changes during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies in "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

There may also be other factors that have not been anticipated or that are not described in our periodic filings with the SEC, generally because we did not believe them to be significant at the time, which could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. 

Item 3   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  There have been no other significant changes in our exposure to market risk during the   third   quarter of   2016  .

Exhibit 

Exhibit 12.1 
  Allegion plc 
  RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES 

*  Includes interest expense on all third-party indebtedness, and excludes interest related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is reported as income tax expense.  
    
  The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed by dividing earnings by fixed charges for the periods indicated where earnings consists of (1) earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus (2) fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of (a) interest on all indebtedness, (b) amortization of premiums, discounts and capitalized expenses related to indebtedness and (c) an interest component representing the estimated portion of rental expense that management believes is attributable to interest.
