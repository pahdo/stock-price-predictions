Note
1   Basis of Presentation  

The
interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Players Network (the  Company ) included herein, presented
in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and stated in US dollars, have been prepared by the
Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that
the disclosures are adequate to not make the information presented misleading.  

These
statements reflect all adjustments, which in the opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of the information
contained therein. Except as otherwise disclosed, all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. It is suggested that
these interim condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company
for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the
SEC. The Company follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of interim reports.

(1) Players
Network entity is in the form of a Corporation.  

(2) Majority-owned
subsidiary formed on July 8, 2014, in which PNTV holds 84.4% ownership, with the remaining 15.6% held by key experts and advisors
as of September 30, 2016.  

(3) Wholly-Owned
subsidiary of GLFH formed for prospective purposes, but has not incurred any income or expenses to date.  

(4) Entity
formed for prospective purposes, but has not incurred any income or expenses to date.  

The
consolidated financial statements herein contain the operations of the wholly-owned subsidiaries listed above. All significant
inter-company transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of these financial statements. The parent company, PNTV and
subsidiaries, GLFH and GLML will be collectively referred to herein as the  Company ,  Players Network 
or  PNTV . The Company s headquarters are located in Las Vegas, Nevada and substantially all of its customers
are within the United States.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Under
FASB ASC 820-10-05, the Financial Accounting Standards Board establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement reaffirms that fair value is the relevant
measurement attribute. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements
as reflected herein. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses reported on the balance sheets are estimated
by management to approximate fair value primarily due to the short term nature of the instruments. In addition, the Company had
debt instruments that required fair value measurement on a recurring basis.  

Construction
in Progress   

The
Company is constructing a grow house in its leased facility, which is scheduled to be operational during the fourth quarter of
2016, at which time depreciation will commence. As of September 30, 2016, the Company incurred and capitalized in Construction
in Progress $116,904. The estimated cost to be incurred in 2016 and 2017 to complete construction of the grow house is approximately
$1.7 million. The construction will be completed in phases and the portion of the $1.7 million incurred after the facility is
initially operational will be capitalized separately as separate leasehold improvements, while the costs incurred to get the facility
operational will begin to be depreciated upon commencement of operations.

Deferred
Television Costs   

Deferred
television costs included direct production and development costs stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on
anticipated revenue. Production overhead is not included as the Company outsources its production costs to third party vendors.
Capitalized television production costs for each pilot episode are to be expensed as revenues are recognized upon delivery and
acceptance of the completed pilot episodes using the individual-film-forecast-computation method for each television show produced.
The Company recognized $95,000 of revenues on November 1, 2012 with the completion of the first of three pilot episodes; and accordingly,
recognized $75,617 of expenses related to the development of the pilot. The remaining $135,000 of revenues, and corresponding
$116,454 of deferred television costs, were deferred and will be recognized upon completion and delivery of the remaining content.
We also delivered a series of  webisodes  and miscellaneous footage in the second quarter of 2014, however, the recipient
refused to accept the modification of the terms and we had to reverse the recognition and defer the revenue and related television
costs.  

Deferred
television costs consist of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Due
to practical limitations applicable to monetizing our developed content over On-Demand networks, the Company has not considered
collectability of advertising or television license revenues to be reasonably assured, and accordingly, the Company has expensed
production costs related to the development of our On-Demand and internet-based content as incurred.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue from its internet television platform from internally generated products and from partnered merchants
when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the selling price is
fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. These criteria are met when the customers purchase a product
or access a web-based video, the product or web-based video has been electronically delivered to the purchaser and payment has
been received. At that time, the Company s obligations to the customer is substantially complete. The Company records the
net amount it retains from the sale of items from its internet television platform after paying any agreed upon percentage of
the purchase price to the featured advertising merchant excluding any applicable taxes. Revenue is recorded on a net basis because
the Company is acting as an agent of the partnered merchant in the transaction. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers,
estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The
Company defers any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company
and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.  

Network
revenue consists of monthly network broadcast subscription revenue, which is recognized over the period in which the subscription
service is available. Broadcast television advertising revenue is recognized when advertisements are aired. Video production revenue
is recognized as digital video film is completed and accepted by the customer and collection is reasonably assured.  

Revenue
from the distribution of domestic television series is recognized as earned using the following criteria:  

Persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists;   

The
    show/episode is complete, and in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, has been delivered or is available for immediate
    and unconditional delivery;   

The
    license period has begun and the customer can begin its exploitation, exhibition or sale;   

The
    price to the customer is fixed and determinable; and   

Collectability
    is reasonably assured.   

Due
to practical limitations applicable to operating relationships with On-Demand networks, the Company has not considered collectability
of advertising or television license revenues to be reasonably assured, and accordingly, the Company has not recognize such revenue
unless payment has been received.  

Audio/Video
content licensing revenues were recognized when the underlying royalties from the sales of the related products were earned. The
Company recognized minimum revenue guarantees, if any, ratably over the term of the license or as earned royalties based on actual
sales of the related products, if greater.

Deferred
revenues consist of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Deferred
Rent Obligation   

The
Company has entered into operating lease agreements for its corporate office and GLFH s warehouse which contains provisions
for future rent increases. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company records monthly rent expense
equal to the total of the payments due over the lease term, divided by the number of months of the lease terms. The difference
between rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged to  Deferred rent obligation,  which is reflected
as a separate line item in the accompanying Balance Sheets.  

Derivative
Liability   

The
Company evaluates its convertible instruments, options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded
components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives and
Hedging.  The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance
sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value
is recorded in the statement of operations as other income (expense). Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument,
the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Equity instruments
that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815 are reclassified to liabilities
at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. We analyzed the derivative financial instruments (the Convertible
Note and tainted Warrant), in accordance with ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked
financial instrument is indexed to an entity s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception which would
enable a derivative instrument to be accounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument
that falls within the scope of ASC 815-40-05  Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially
Settled in, a Company s Own Stock  also hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity s own stock.
A non-derivative instrument that is not indexed to an entity s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted
for as a liability. There is a two-step approach in determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s
own stock. First, the instrument s contingent exercise provisions, if any, must be evaluated, followed by an evaluation
of the instrument s settlement provisions. The Company utilized multinomial lattice models that value the derivative liability
within the notes based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The Company utilized the fair value standard set
forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, defined as the amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or
incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between willing parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation
sale.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
August, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  (a consensus
of the Emerging Issues Task Force). Effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should
be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must
adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial
statements.  

In
June, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments.  For public business entities that are U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filers, the
amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. For all other public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, including not-for-profit entities
and employee benefit plans within the scope of Topics 960 through 965 on plan accounting, the amendments in this Update are effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021.
All entities may adopt the amendments in this Update earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial statements.

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)  ( ASU
2016-09 ) .  The provisions of the update amend ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation, and includes
provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial
statements, including accounting for the income tax consequences, estimates of forfeitures and classification of excess tax benefits
on the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2016, including interim periods. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial statements.  

In
March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).  The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements
for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of Update 2014-09. Accounting
Standards Update No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , defers
the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial
statements.  

In
March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,  Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the
Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.  Effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases
in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application
is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial statements.  

In
March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04,  Liabilities Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition
of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products  (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). Effective for public
business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019. Earlier application is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is evaluating
the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU
2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases, including the recognition of a
right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will
be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
This standard also introduces new disclosure requirements for leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. This ASU must
be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial
statements.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10), Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ) .  The provisions of the update require equity
investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to
measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment. The update also simplifies
the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment
to identify impairment. It also eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized
cost for entities that are not public business entities, and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose
the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on
the balance sheet. ASU No. 2016-16 requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value
of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. It also requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income
the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk
when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments.
The update requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by category and form on the balance sheet
or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. In addition, the update clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need
for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s
other deferred tax assets. For public business entities, the amendments in the update are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim periods. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company s financial statements.

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)  ( ASU 2015-03 ),
which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such
costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the
costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. For public business entities, ASU 2015-03 is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities,
ASU 2015-03 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods
within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been
previously issued. The new guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on its balance
sheets retrospectively during the interim period ending March 31, 2016.

2   Going Concern   

As
shown in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations
resulting in an accumulated deficit of ($30,264,249), and as of September 30, 2016, the Company s current liabilities exceeded
its current assets by $1,969,288. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. Management is actively pursuing new ventures to increase revenues. In addition, the Company is currently seeking additional
sources of capital to fund short term operations. Management believes these factors will contribute toward achieving profitability.
The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
as a going concern.  

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements also do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Note
4   Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

Under
FASB ASC 820-10-5, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The standard outlines a valuation
framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements
and the related disclosures. Under GAAP, certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and FASB ASC 820-10-50
details the disclosures that are required for items measured at fair value.

The
Company has convertible notes that must be measured under the new fair value standard. The Company s financial assets and
liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:  

Level
1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
to access at the measurement date.  

Level
2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
(e.g., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).  

Level
3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability.  

The
following schedule summarizes the valuation of financial instruments at fair value on a non-recurring basis in the balance sheets
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively:  

There
were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Level
2 liabilities consisted of a total of $168,000 and $8,500 of short term, unsecured, promissory notes, net of discounts of $2,856
and $-0- as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. No fair value adjustment was necessary during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Level
3 liabilities consist of a total of $449,118 and $671,940 of convertible debentures, net of discounts of $250,974 and $287,802
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, in addition to the related derivative liabilities of $701,462 and

5   Subsidiary Formation   

On
July 8, 2014, we formed a subsidiary, Green Leaf Farms Holdings, Inc. ( GLFH ), in which we retained 83% ownership,
with the remaining 17% held by key experts and advisors, of which 16% was distributed to individuals as compensation for their
services, including 3% to Mr. Bradley, CEO and 1% to Mr. Berk, President of Programming, and an additional 1% was sold to one
of those individuals for $60,000. An additional 1.6% was sold to an investor on December 8, 2014 and 3% was transferred back from
a founding member on December 2, 2015, giving PNTV 84.4% ownership and minority interests ownership of 18.6% as of December 31,
2015. The subsidiary has been formed as a holding company to potentially own additional subsidiaries that may operate medical
marijuana related businesses. These additional subsidiaries have yet to be formed, and, or, acquired, with the exception of Green
Leaf Medical, LLC ( GLML ), which was formed on July 18, 2014 and has no activity to date. We had applied for a Medical
Marijuana Dispensary special use permit with the City of Las Vegas, and Cultivation and Processing special use permits in North
Las Vegas and a license for all permits in the State of Nevada, and have currently been granted the two special use permits in
North Las Vegas, however there can be no assurance we will be able to conduct these operations. As such, there is a risk that
we may not be able to expand our operations into this field as intended.

for the variable conversion features of the convertible debts incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the
year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The discounts, including Original Issue Discounts of $-0- and $23,500 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, are being amortized to interest expense over
the term of the debentures using the effective interest method. The Company recorded $294,207 and $720,764 of interest expense
pursuant to the amortization of the note discounts during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

All
of the convertible debentures carry default provisions that place a  maximum share amount  on the note holders. The
maximum share amount that can be owned as a result of the conversions to common stock by the note holders is 4.99% of the Company s
issued and outstanding shares.  

In
accordance with ASC 815-15, the Company determined that the variable conversion feature and shares to be issued represented embedded
derivative features, and these are shown as derivative liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company calculated the fair value
of the compound embedded derivatives associated with the convertible debentures utilizing a lattice model.  

The

Note 11   Derivative Liabilities  

As discussed in Note 9 under Convertible Debentures,
the Company issued convertible notes payable that provide for the issuance of convertible notes with variable conversion provisions.
The conversion terms of the convertible notes are variable based on certain factors, such as the future price of the Company s
common stock. The number of shares of common stock to be issued is based on the future price of the Company s common stock.
The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the promissory note is indeterminate. Due to the fact that the
number of shares of common stock issuable could exceed the Company s authorized share limit, the equity environment is tainted
and all additional convertible debentures and warrants are included in the value of the derivative. Pursuant to ASC 815-15 Embedded
Derivatives, the fair values of the variable conversion option and warrants and shares to be issued were recorded as derivative
liabilities on the issuance date. 

The fair values of the Company s derivative
liabilities were estimated at the issuance date and are revalued at each subsequent reporting date, using a lattice model. The
Company recognized current derivative liabilities of $701,462 and $1,038,504 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
The change in fair value of the derivative liabilities resulted in a loss of $238,679 and $206,241 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which has been reported as other expense in the statements of operations. The loss of $238,679
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of a gain of $167 attributable to the fair value of warrants and a net loss
in market value of $238,679 on the convertible notes. The loss of $206,241 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted
of a loss of $293,144 due to the value in excess of the face value of the convertible notes, a gain of $2,793 attributable to the
fair value of preferred stock, a gain of $110,303 attributable to the fair value of warrants and a net loss in market value of
$26,193 on the convertible notes.

Key inputs and assumptions
used to value the convertible debentures and warrants issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended
December 31, 2015:  

Stock  prices on all measurement dates were based on the fair market value and would fluctuate with projected volatility .   

The warrant exercise prices ranged from $0.01 to $0.18, exercisable over 2 to 10 year periods from the grant date.   

The holders of the securities would convert monthly to the ownership limit starting at 4.99% increasing by 10% per month.   

The monthly trading volume would reflect historical averages and would increase at 1% per month.   

The holder would automatically convert the notes at maturity at the greater of 2 times the conversion price or stock price if the registration was effective and the Company was not in default.   

An event of default for the convertible note would occur 0% of the time, increasing to 1% per month to a maximum of 5%.   

Alternative financing for the convertible note would be initially available to redeem the note 0% of the time and increase monthly by 1% to a maximum of 10%.   

The computed volatility was projected based on historical volatility.

Note 15   Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes under
FASB ASC 740-10, which requires use of the liability method. FASB ASC 740-10-25 provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recorded based on the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial
reporting purposes, referred to as temporary differences. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred a net operating loss and, accordingly, no provision for income taxes
has been recorded. In addition, no benefit for income taxes has been recorded due to the uncertainty of the realization of any
tax assets. At September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $21,825,000 of federal net operating losses. The net operating
loss carry forwards, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2025.

The components of the Company s deferred
tax asset are as follows: 

Based on the available objective evidence,
including the Company s history of its loss, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets
will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company provided for a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

A reconciliation between the amounts of income
tax benefit determined by applying the applicable U.S. and State statutory income tax rate to pre-tax loss is as follows: 

In accordance with FASB ASC 740, the Company
has evaluated its tax positions and determined there are no uncertain tax positions.

President of Programming, Michael Berk own 3% and 1%, respectively, through December 8, 2014. On December 9, 2014, one of the non-officer,
minority investors exercised an option to purchase an additional 1.6% interest in the Company s subsidiary from the parent
in exchange for proceeds of $160,000 and 3% was transferred back to Players Network from a founding member on December 2, 2015,
thereby resulting in a minority interest in the subsidiary of 15.6% amongst ten individuals. The net loss attributable to the non-controlling
interest totaled $31,642 and $25,258 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.  

Overview and Outlook  

Players Network is a vertically integrated
diversified, fully reporting public company that is engaged in the development of digital networks, and is actively pursuing the
cultivation and processing of medical marijuana in North Las Vegas pursuant to two medical marijuana establishments (MME) licenses
we were granted by the city of North Las Vegas for cultivation and production. The Company holds an 84.4% interest in Green Leaf
Farms Holdings, LLC, which is a holding company formed to house our medical and marijuana business, and recreational marijuana
business that was legalized in the state of Nevada on November 8, 2016. We distribute broadband video and other social media content
over a wide variety of internet enabled devices and cable television channels. The Company has launched its proprietary scalable
NexGenTV technology platform. The platform is designed to deliver video content and develop digital social communities, including
 Vegas On Demand TV ,  Real Vegas TV  and  Weed TV  on the media side of the business. 

NexGenTV, our scalable Digital Technology Platform,
allows Players Network to distribute content for brands, businesses and celebrities, and provide them with an unlimited amount
of lifestyle category content and the tools to launch their own  Branded Channel, Social Community and Marketplace Destination .
NexGenTV s scalability can create hundreds of niche digital networks that can be viewed worldwide on any smart TV, computer,
tablet or mobile device by millions of people simultaneously. The Platform allows advertisers and marketing partners the ability
to capture their target market through rich content such as professionally produced, branded television segments; user-generated
videos; blogs; editorials; tweets; photos; special offers; events and custom-designed contests. 

Our business model incorporates elements of
traditional proven media features, such as advertising and transactional delivery methods, but also offers professional production,
marketing and distribution services to build and monetize its branded channel destination, in which we expect to retain a continuous
revenue stream with our partners. Channel partners have the option to manage their own Branded New Media Channel, or use our professional
services team of television producers, writers, graphic designers and technologists to keep their channel updated, and their content
fresh and relevant. 

Vegas On Demand TV, Real Vegas TV and Weed
TV are the Company s first three channel offerings that provide their audience the ability to connect to industry insiders
and businesses through unique, high-quality marketing, content production and content management system. In the Las Vegas market,
Vegas On Demand captures the excitement, sex appeal, entertainment, and the non-stop adrenaline rush of the Las Vegas gaming lifestyle.
Our content goes beyond poker, casino action, sports betting, and racing, to lifestyle programs about entertainment and fine living
that attract young and sophisticated viewers that comprise the major digital media demographic. Whenever possible, our content
will incorporate an expert, insider or celebrity within the Vegas community in order to enhance promotional merchandising to prospective
customers. 

Weed TV launched on April 20, 2014, and was
the Company s third network to be launched. Weed TV is a Lifestyle Channel Destination powered by PNTV s NextGenTV(SM)
enterprise platform. Weed TV is the  go to  source for informational entertainment, products and services for people
who relate to the marijuana lifestyle and social community. Weed TV will feature daily stories sourced by weedtv.com correspondents
and contributors from around the world. It will provide a wide variety of editorial content, videos and entertainment, including
lead stories, political news, business news on the industry, financial analysis from industry experts, growing tips, cooking tips,
a  Weed101  section, medical uses, lifestyle features, entertainment specials and merchandise shopping cart offering
the latest products and services.  www.weedtv.com  

We plan for Weed TV to have
other features by the end of 2016 and adapt new technology that the other networks don t have, including a directory of businesses
that cater to the marijuana business, such as dispensaries, smoke shops, doctors, financial institutions, manufactures and more.
These businesses will have a free basic listing and the ability to upgrade for an extra fee of approximately $500 per month, where
they can build their own media channel using the  NextGenTV  Platform. We estimate this market is in excess of approximately
70,000 businesses and will continue to grow as more states legalize MME businesses. Our goal in 2016 is to begin to capture this
market that will translate to significant revenues even if we only convert a small amount of this market into marketing partners
who use our platform. 

We plan to use both, Weed TV s platform
and original branded programming and events, as a means to develop additional revenue streams, in addition to providing marketing
and membership benefits of our social media platform. These revenue streams include branded entertainment, sponsorships for events,
media placement, third party commissions for video and banner advertisements, merchandise and production sales and services. 

We have addressed the digital market in an
effort to grow as a New Media Company using  Vegas On Demand  and Real Vegas TV, our flagship branded television channel,
and to use our scalable custom enterprise web platform, which can also be replicated to launch thousands of channel destinations
in any lifestyle category for any lifestyle brand. 

Our enterprise platform is highly scalable
and can efficiently deploy, manage and distribute videos with integrated revenue-generating tools that go beyond traditional advertising.
On our platform, the viewer of a video is brought into a web environment encompassing the lifestyle represented within the video
content where they are presented with membership, merchandising, couponing, subscription, loyalty programs, contest and other marketing
opportunities, including the integration of live events. The platform also integrates branded sponsorships, and a game-like virtual
economy supported by our Cost Per Action ( CPA ) advertising network. 

Our next-generation media network operates
across all distribution platforms from TV screens to mobile devices, gaming consoles, computers and tablets. We have positioned
ourselves to provide companies an affordable, turnkey, integrated solution. We have not yet generated revenues from our Platform,
but plan to market our services to companies in 2016. 

Through the cross-promotional integration of
sponsored live events, contests and media creation and distribution, our Platform can deliver a targeted audience that can be monetized
in multiple ways. The platform is an engine that grows as audience and page views increase. The platform also provides a self-perpetuating
aggregation juncture where Las Vegas businesses and  insiders  can connect socially with their audience/customer. 

The ability to monetize video in so many ways,
coupled with an efficient, easy-to-use technical and administrative back-end dashboard is a powerful feature of our platform. It
allows the creation of unlimited, new channel destinations using our scalable content management system ( CMS ) framework,
with cost-competitive operations. Importantly, it enables administrative and editorial level employees to manage content without
the expense of having a full-time technical engineering staff in-house. 

Premium members must be industry insiders and/or
experts in their lifestyle category. For example, with regard to Vegas On Demand, insiders are designed to be the who s-who
of Vegas: entertainers, nightclub promoters, casino hosts, famous chefs, etc. who offer our members deals on transactions connected
to their sphere of influence. Deals may include being invited to a special VIP event, line passes, two-for-one offers, pay-per-view
video discounts, etc.

of $(196,086) during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the $(243,397) change in derivative liability for the
three months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in a decrease of $67,311, or 19%, a decreased interest expense on debt financing

for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $694,366 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of

for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $22,607 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $1,024,

Common Stock Sales  

On September 15, 2016, the Company sold 16,750,000
shares of its common stock to an accredited investor in exchange for proceeds of $117,250. 

We have utilized these funds to repay approximately
$54,310 of previously issued convertible debentures and settlements, comply with our regulatory reporting requirements, and to
fund our subsidiary s medical marijuana business during the third quarter. Although our revenues are expected to grow as
we expand our operations, our revenues are not expected to exceed our investment and operating costs in the next twelve months,
and we do not have funds sufficient to fund our operations at their current level for the next twelve months. Our prospects must
be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of operations.
To address these risks, we must, among other things, seek growth opportunities through investment and acquisitions in our industry,
effectively monitor and manage our claims for payments that are owed to us, implement and successfully execute our business strategy,
respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We cannot assure that we will be successful
in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition
and results of operations. 

To conserve on the Company s capital
requirements, the Company has issued shares in lieu of cash payments to outside consultants, and the Company expects to continue
this practice. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted a total of $346,000 stock-based compensation, consisting
of 6,250,000 shares of preferred stock valued at $192,000 and 20,400,000 shares of common stock valued at $102,000 in lieu of cash
payments to our CEO, as well as an aggregate 9,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $45,000 to our Directors and 2,000,000
shares valued at $7,000 to an attorney, compared to a total of 13,700,000 shares of common stock and 5,750,000 shares of Convertible
Preferred Series C Stock valued at $370,640 in lieu of cash payments to employees and outside consultants during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The Company is not now in a position to determine an approximate number of shares that the Company may
issue for the preceding purpose in the remainder of 2016. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we issued a total of 71,386,168 shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of $232,698 of indebtedness on convertible
debentures and related settlements. As of November 16, 2016, we had five convertible notes outstanding with a cumulative outstanding
principal balance of $431,450. Repayment of the notes must be done at a premium to the then-outstanding balance, resulting in the
need for approximately $375,000 in liquid capital. If, rather than repay these notes, we allow them to convert into our common
stock, which conversions would be done at a discount to the market price of our common stock, all of which could be sold into the
open market at the time of conversion. The potential dilutive effects of these conversions at various conversion prices below our
most recent market price of $0.017 per share is as follows: 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources. 

Going Concern   

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company has had recurring net losses, an
accumulated deficit, and a working capital deficiency. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as
a going concern. Management plans to try to increase sales and improve operating results through the expansion of the distribution
channels of our programming with a view to increasing advertising and sponsorship revenues. Management believes that funds generated
from operations will not be sufficient to cover cash needs in the foreseeable future, and we will continue to rely on expected
increased revenues and private equity to cover our cash needs, although there can be no assurance in this regard. In the event
sales do not materialize at the expected rates, management would seek additional financing or would conserve cash by further reducing
expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving these objectives, becoming profitable or continuing
our business without either a temporary interruption or a permanent cessation. 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

We have identified the following policies below
as critical to our business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted by the application of the following accounting
policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve making estimates
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact quarterly or annual results of operations.
For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as expected, and the best estimates routinely
require adjustment. Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs.

The consolidated financial statements herein
contain the operations of the wholly-owned subsidiaries listed above. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated
in the preparation of these financial statements. The parent company, PNTV and subsidiaries, GLFH and GLML will be collectively
referred to herein as the  Company ,  Players Network  or  PNTV . The Company s headquarters
are located in Las Vegas, Nevada and substantially all of its customers are within the United States. 

Revenue
Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenue from its internet
television platform from internally generated products and from partnered merchants when the following criteria are met: persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the selling price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably
assured. These criteria are met when the customers purchase a product or access a web-based video, the product or web-based video
has been electronically delivered to the purchaser and payment has been received. At that time, the Company s obligations
to the customer is substantially complete. The Company records the net amount it retains from the sale of items from its internet
television platform after paying any agreed upon percentage of the purchase price to the featured advertising merchant excluding
any applicable taxes. Revenue is recorded on a net basis because the Company is acting as an agent of the partnered merchant in
the transaction. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are
provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company defers any revenue for which the product has not been
delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been
delivered or no refund will be required. 

Network revenue consists of monthly network
broadcast subscription revenue, which is recognized over the period in which the subscription service is available. Broadcast television
advertising revenue is recognized when advertisements are aired. Video production revenue is recognized as digital video film is
completed and accepted by the customer and collection is reasonably assured. 

Revenue from the distribution of domestic television
series is recognized as earned using the following criteria: 

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;   

The show/episode is complete, and in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, has been delivered or is available for immediate and unconditional delivery;   

The license period has begun and the customer can begin its exploitation, exhibition or sale;   

The price to the customer is fixed and determinable; and   

Collectability is reasonably assured.   

Due to practical limitations applicable to
operating relationships with On-Demand networks, the Company has not considered collectability of advertising or television license
revenues to be reasonably assured, and accordingly, the Company has not recognize such revenue unless payment has been received. 

Audio/Video content licensing revenues were
recognized when the underlying royalties from the sales of the related products were earned. The Company recognized minimum revenue
guarantees, if any, ratably over the term of the license or as earned royalties based on actual sales of the related products,
if greater. 

Derivative Liability  

The Company evaluates its convertible instruments,
options, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives
to be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives and Hedging.  The result of this accounting treatment
is that the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event
that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income
(expense). Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date
and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject
to reclassification under ASC Topic 815 are reclassified to liabilities at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification
date. We analyzed the derivative financial instruments (the Convertible Note and tainted Warrant), in accordance with ASC 815.
The objective is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument is indexed to an entity s
own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception which would enable a derivative instrument to be accounted for under
the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument that falls within the scope of ASC 815-40-05  Accounting
for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company s Own Stock  also hinges on
whether the instrument is indexed to an entity s own stock. A non-derivative instrument that is not indexed to an entity s
own stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted for as a liability. There is a two-step approach in determining
whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock. First, the instrument s contingent exercise
provisions, if any, must be evaluated, followed by an evaluation of the instrument s settlement provisions. The Company utilized
multinomial lattice models that value the derivative liability within the notes based on a probability weighted discounted cash
flow model. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, defined as the
amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between willing
parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risks  

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We carried out an evaluation as of September
30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, who are one and the same, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during our most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

In the ordinary course of business, we may
become subject to lawsuits and other claims and proceedings that might arise from litigation matters or regulatory audits. Such
matters are subject to uncertainty and outcomes are often not predictable with assurance. Our management does not presently expect
that such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. We are
not currently involved in any pending or threatened material litigation or other material legal proceedings, nor have we been made
aware of any penalties from regulatory audits, except as we have previously disclosed, or may in the future disclose. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

As a smaller reporting company, we are not
required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds  

The following sales of equity securities by
the Company occurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2016: 

Common Stock Sales  

On September 15, 2016, the Company sold 16,750,000
shares of its common stock to an accredited investor in exchange for proceeds of $117,250. 

Common Stock Issuances for Debt Conversions  

On September 23, 2016, the Company issued 7,238,041
shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of $16,512 of outstanding principal on the First WHC Note. 

On September 22, 2016, the Company issued 13,813,364
shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of $29,975 of outstanding principal on the First Collier Note. 

On August 30, 2016, the Company issued 4,667,667
shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of $7,000 of outstanding principal on the First Tangiers Note. 

On August 24, 2016, the Company issued 5,000,000
shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of $7,800 of outstanding principal on the First WHC Note. 

On August 24, 2016, the Company issued 10,000,000
shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of $18,900 of outstanding principal on the First Collier Note. 

On July 20, 2016, the Company issued 4,995,098
shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of $10,190 of outstanding principal on the First Tangiers Note. 

On July 15, 2016, the Company issued 969,696
shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of $2,000 of outstanding principal on the Second WHC Note. 

The foregoing securities issued upon conversion
of the Notes are restricted securities as defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. The issuances of the
Notes were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated
thereunder. The purchasers were accredited and sophisticated investors, familiar with our operations, and there was no solicitation. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities  

On October 24, 2014, a note holder submitted
a conversion request to convert $10,000 of principal on the Second LG Note, which was inconsistent with the conversion terms as
stated in the convertible promissory note. The Company requested that the conversion notice be corrected and resubmitted, at which
time the note holder contended the conversion terms were intended to be based on 55% of the lowest closing bid price over the preceding
twelve trading days, as opposed to the stated 55% of the average of the lowest closing bid price of the Common Stock over the preceding
twelve trading days. On October 31, 2014, the note holder sent demand for repayment on the Second LG Note, consisting of $35,000
of principal and $7,514 of accrued interest outstanding as of September 30, 2016. As a result, we are in default on this convertible
promissory note. The note carries an 18% default interest rate and a penalty of $250 per day that the shares are not issued, beginning
on the 4th day after the conversion notice was delivered to the Company. This penalty increased to $500 per day beginning on the
10th day after the conversion notice was delivered to the Company.
