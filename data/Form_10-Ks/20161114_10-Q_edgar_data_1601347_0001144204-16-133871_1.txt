NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

 (unaudited) 

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS  

Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. (the  Company ),
was incorporated in February 2014 under the laws of the State of Maryland. The Company owns all of the outstanding shares of common
stock of Pilgrim Bank (the  Bank ). The Bank is a Massachusetts chartered stock bank which was incorporated in 1916
and is headquartered in Cohasset, Massachusetts.  The Bank operates its business from three banking offices located in Massachusetts. 
The Bank is engaged principally in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits in
residential and commercial real estate loans, and in commercial, consumer and small business loans.  The Bank is subject to
the regulations of, and periodic examination by, the Massachusetts Division of Banks ( DOB ) and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation ( the FDIC ). 

NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank, and the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiaries, 48 South
Main Street Corporation, which was formed to hold securities for its own account; 40 South Main Street Realty Trust, which was
formed to hold our main office; and 800 CJC Realty Corporation, which was formed to invest in and develop residential and commercial
property.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP )
for interim financial information and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and accompanying notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  Information included herein as of September 30,
2016 and for the interim periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, all adjustments
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and were of a normal recurring nature.  The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
entire year or any other interim period. 

These
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity
with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the consolidated balance sheets and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change
in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, impairment of securities and the valuation of deferred
tax assets.    

NOTE 3 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

As an  emerging growth company, 
as defined in Title 1 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, the Company has elected to use the extended transition
period to delay adoption of new or reissued accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements
are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial
statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. As of September 30, 2016, there is no
significant difference in the comparability of the financial statements as a result of this extended transition period. 

In January 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic
825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   The amendments in this ASU address
certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments and make targeted improvements
to GAAP as follows: 

1.  Require equity investments (except those accounted for
under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in net income.  However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not
have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same manner. 

2.  Simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments
without determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment.  When a qualitative assessment
indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. 

3.  Eliminate the requirement for public business entities
to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial
instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. 

4.  Require public business entities to use the exit price
notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. 

5.  Require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive
income the portion of the total change in fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit
risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial
instruments. 

6.  Require separate presentation of financial assets and financial
liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance
sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. 

7.  Clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation
allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred
tax assets. 

Under the extended transition period for
an emerging growth company, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and
interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption of item 5 above is permitted as of the beginning of fiscal years
or interim periods for which financial statements have not been issued.  Early adoption of all other amendments in this ASU
is not permitted.  The Company anticipates that the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842).   This ASU was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring
reporting entities to recognize all leases, including operating, as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and
disclose key information about leasing arrangements.  Under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company,
the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2020.  The Company anticipates that the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact
on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
 Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting.  The ASU simplifies
several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. Under the extended transition
period for an emerging growth company, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently reviewing this ASU
to determine if it will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326).   The amendments in this ASU affect entities holding financial
assets and net investments in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income.  The main objective of this
ASU is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial
instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.  To achieve this objective,
the amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected
credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. 
This ASU also requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant
estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a reporting
entity s portfolio.  Additionally, this ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities
and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.  Under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company,
the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2021.  All entities may adopt the amendments in this ASU earlier as of the fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  An entity will apply the amendments
in this ASU through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which
the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach).  The Company is currently reviewing the amendments
in this ASU to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  Current GAAP is unclear or does not include specific guidance
on how to classify certain transactions in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is intended to reduce diversity in practice in
how eight particular transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. Under the extended transition period for an emerging
growth company, the amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods
within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted
in the same period. Entities will be required to apply the guidance retrospectively. If it is impracticable to apply the guidance
retrospectively for an issue, the amendments related to that issue would be applied prospectively. As this guidance only affects
the classification within the statement of cash flows, ASU No. 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 4 - EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)  

The Company has adopted the EPS guidance
included in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 260-10.  As presented below, basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock
were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the
entity.  For purposes of computing diluted EPS, the treasury stock method is used.  

Unallocated ESOP shares are not deemed
outstanding for earnings per share calculations. 

EPS for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited) have been computed based on the following: 

(1) Options to purchase 169,500 shares,
representing all outstanding options, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 because the effect is anti-dilutive. 

NOTE 5 - INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES  

Investments in securities have been classified in the consolidated
balance sheets according to management s intent.  The amortized cost basis of securities and their approximate fair
values are as follows: 

The scheduled maturities of debt securities
were as follows as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited): 

Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale
securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited) were $1.2 million with gross realized gains of $24,000 and
no gross realized losses. The tax expense related to these net realized gains for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016
(unaudited) amounted to $9,000.  

As of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and
December 31, 2015, there were no securities of issuers whose aggregate carrying amount exceeded 10% of stockholders  equity. 

The aggregate fair value and unrealized
losses of securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and for twelve months
or more, and are not other-than-temporarily impaired, are as follows: 

As of September 30, 2016 (unaudited), investment
securities with unrealized losses consist of 4   debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies
and government-sponsored enterprises, 3 debt securities issued by states of the United States and political subdivisions of the
states and 12   mortgage-backed securities.  The Company reviews investments for other-than-temporary
impairment using a number of factors including the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost
and by examining any credit deterioration or ratings downgrades.  The unrealized losses in the above tables are primarily
attributable to changes in market interest rates.  As Company management has the intent and ability to hold impaired debt
securities until maturity, or for the foreseeable future if classified as available-for-sale, no declines are deemed to be other-than-temporary.   

For those debt securities for which the
fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis and the Company does not intend to sell such security and it is
more likely than not that it will not be required to sell such security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis less
any credit losses, ASC 320-10,  Investments - Debt and Equity Securities,  requires that the credit component of the
other-than-temporary impairment losses be recognized in earnings while the noncredit component is recognized in other comprehensive
income, net of related taxes. 

The following table summarizes other-than-temporary
impairment losses on securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited):

No other-than-temporary impairment losses
were recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, debt securities
with other-than-temporary impairment losses related to credit quality that were recognized in earnings consisted of non-agency
mortgage-backed securities. The Company estimated the credit component portion of loss for the non-agency mortgage-backed securities
using a discounted cash flow model.  Significant inputs for the non-agency mortgage-backed securities included estimated cash
flows of the underlying collateral based on key assumptions such as default rate, loss severity and prepayment rate.  The
present value of the expected cash flows was compared to the Company s holdings to determine the credit-related impairment
loss.  Based on the expected cash flows derived from the model, the Company expects to recover the remaining unrealized losses
on non-agency mortgage-backed securities.

categories are considered  pass  rated loans with low to average risk. 

Loans rated 4:  Loans in this category
are considered  special mention.   These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are being
closely monitored by management. 

Loans rated 5:  Loans in this category
are considered  substandard.   Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by
the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged.  There is a distinct possibility
that the Company will sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected. 

Loans rated 6:  Loans in this category
are considered  doubtful.   Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified
substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently
existing facts, highly questionable and improbable. 

Loans rated 7:  Loans in this category
are considered uncollectible ( loss ) and of such little value that their continuance as loans is not warranted. 

On an annual basis, or more often if needed,
the Company formally reviews the ratings on all commercial real estate, construction and commercial loans.  For residential
real estate and consumer loans, the Company initially assesses credit quality based upon the borrower s ability to pay and
subsequently monitors these loans based on the borrower s payment activity. 

The Company classifies loans modified as
troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) as impaired loans with an allowance established as part of the allocated component of the allowance
for loan losses when the discounted cash flows or value of the underlying collateral of the impaired loan is lower than its carrying
value.  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016 (unaudited), there were no loans modified as TDRs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited), five loans
were modified as TDRs.  Three of the modified loans paid off by September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September
30, 2015 (unaudited), there were no loans modified as TDRs. The following table sets forth information regarding the remaining
loans modified as TDRs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

An analysis of the loans modified as TDRs
was performed as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited). An allowance of $21,000 was assigned to 1 one-to-four family residential loan.
All loans were accruing. 

Loans serviced for others are not included
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  The unpaid principal balances of mortgage and other loans serviced for others
were $27.5 million and $21.8 million at September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

On March 25, 2016, the Company entered
into an agreement to purchase $20.0 million of residential mortgages, with 50% of the purchase being fixed rate loans and 50% being
adjustable rate mortgages of varying maturities. The purchase premium is fixed at 1%. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
purchased $17.8 million of loans under this agreement. 

NOTE 7   DEPOSITS  

The aggregate amount of time deposits in
denominations that meet or exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limit of $250,000 at September 30,
2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015 was $24.4 million and $20.9 million, respectively. The totals at September 30, 2016 (unaudited)
and December 31, 2015 exclude $5.0 million of brokered time deposits which were bifurcated into amounts below the FDIC insurance
limit. 

For time deposits as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited), the
scheduled maturities for each of the following five years ended September 30 are: 

NOTE 8 - FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES  

Maturities of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston
( FHLB ) for the years ending after September 30, 2016 (unaudited) are summarized as follows: 

Interest rates range from 0.39% to 1.41% with a weighted-average
interest rate of 0.91% at September 30, 2016 (unaudited).  

Borrowings from the FHLB are secured by
a blanket lien on qualified collateral, consisting primarily of loans with first mortgages secured by one-to-four family properties,
certain unencumbered investment securities and other qualified assets. 

NOTE 9 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

ASC 820-10,  Fair Value Measurement
- Overall,  provides a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles.  This guidance
also allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial
assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis.  

In accordance with ASC 820-10, the Company
groups its financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the
assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. 

Level 1 - Valuations for assets and liabilities
traded in active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing
sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 - Valuations for assets and liabilities
traded in less active dealer or broker markets.  Valuations are obtained from third party pricing services for identical or
comparable assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 - Valuations for assets and liabilities
that are derived from other methodologies, including option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques,
are not based on market exchange, dealer, or broker traded transactions.  Level 3 valuations incorporate certain assumptions
and projections in determining the fair value assigned to such assets and liabilities.  

A financial instrument s level within
the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

A description of the valuation methodologies
used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation
hierarchy, is set forth below.  These valuation methodologies were applied to all of the Company s financial assets
and financial liabilities carried at fair value as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015.  The Company did
not have any significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 (unaudited) and the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The Company s investment in mortgage-backed
securities and other debt securities available-for-sale is generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
For these securities, we obtain fair value measurements from independent pricing services.  The fair value measurements consider
observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, trading levels, market
consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the instrument s terms and conditions. 

Level 3 is for positions that are not traded
in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability,
and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence.  In the absence of such evidence, management s
best estimate is used.  Subsequent to inception, management only changes level 3 inputs and assumptions when corroborated
by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment
or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalization and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings
in the equity or debt markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows. 

The Company s impaired loans are
reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.  Collateral values
are estimated using level 2 inputs based upon appraisals of similar properties obtained from a third party.  For level 3 inputs,
fair value is based upon management estimates of the value of the underlying collateral or the present value of the expected cash
flows. 

The following summarizes assets measured at fair value as of
September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015. 

ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS 

ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS 

Under certain circumstances we make adjustments
to fair value for certain assets and liabilities although they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis.  The following
table presents assets carried on the consolidated balance sheets by caption and by level in the fair value hierarchy at September
30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015, for which a nonrecurring change in fair value has been recorded: 

The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments,
all of which are held or issued for purposes other than trading, are as follows: 

The carrying amounts of financial instruments shown in the above
table are included in the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015 under the indicated
captions.  Accounting policies related to financial instruments are described below. 

ASC 825,  Financial Instruments, 
requires that the Company disclose estimated fair values for its financial instruments.  Fair value methods and assumptions
used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures are as follows: 

Cash and cash equivalents:  The carrying
amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate those assets' fair values. 

Interest-bearing time deposits with other
banks:  The fair value of interest-bearing time deposits with other banks was determined by discounting the cash flows associated
with these instruments using current market rates for deposits with similar characteristics. 

Securities:  Fair values for securities
are based on quoted market prices, where available.  If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted
market prices of comparable instruments. 

Loans receivable:  For variable-rate
loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values.  The
fair values for other loans are estimated by discounting the future cash flows, using interest rates currently being offered for
loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. 

Accrued interest receivable:  The
carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value. 

Deposit liabilities:  The fair values
disclosed for demand deposits, regular savings, NOW accounts, and money market accounts are equal to the amount payable on demand
at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts).  Fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted
cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected
monthly maturities on time deposits. 

Federal Home Loan Bank advances: 
Fair values for Federal Home Loan Bank advances are estimated using a discounted cash flow technique that applies interest rates
currently being offered on advances to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on Federal Home Loan Bank advances. 

Off-balance sheet instruments:  The
fair value of commitments to originate loans is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter similar agreements, taking
into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.  For fixed-rate
loan commitments and the unadvanced portion of loans, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest
rates and the committed rates.  

NOTE 10   REGULATORY CAPITAL     

The Bank is subject to various regulatory
capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate
certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material
effect on the Bank s financial statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt
corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets,
liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  The Bank s capital
amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other
factors. 

Effective January 1, 2015 (with a phase-in
period of two to four years for certain components), the Bank became subject to new capital regulations adopted by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( FRB ) and the FDIC, which implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms
and the changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.  The new regulations require a new common equity Tier 1 ( CET1 )
capital ratio of 4.5%, increase the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio to 6.0% from 4.0%, require a minimum total
capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%.  CET1 generally consists
of common stock and retained earnings, subject to applicable adjustments and deductions.  Under new prompt corrective action
regulations, in order to be considered  well capitalized,  the Bank must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% (new)
and a Tier 1 ratio of 8.0% (increased from 6.0%), a total risk based capital ratio of 10.0% (unchanged) and a Tier 1 leverage ratio
of 5.0% (unchanged).   In addition, the regulations establish a capital conservation buffer above the required capital
ratios that began phasing in on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year by 0.625% until it is
fully phased in at 2.5% effective January 1, 2019.  Beginning January 1, 2016, failure to maintain the capital conservation
buffer will limit the ability of the Bank and the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. 

The new regulations changed what constitutes
regulatory capital.  Certain instruments will no longer constitute qualifying capital, subject to phase-out periods. 
In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital.  Mortgage servicing
rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of CET1 will be
deducted from capital.  

The new regulations also changed the risk
weights of certain assets, including an increase in the risk weight of certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition,
development and construction loans and non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or on non-accrual status to 150%
from 100%, a credit conversion factor for the unused portion of commitments with maturities of less than one year that are not
cancellable to 20% from 0%, an increase in the risk weight for mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets that are not deducted
from capital to 250% from 100%, and an increase in the risk weight for equity exposures to 600% from 100%. 

Management believes, as of September 30,
2016, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. 

As of September 30, 2016 (unaudited), the
most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
action.  To be categorized as well capitalized the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, Common
Equity risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table.  There are no conditions or events since
that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s category. 

The Bank s actual capital amounts
and ratios are presented in the table below. 

NOTE 11   COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES  

On November 24, 2015, the Board of Directors
of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to 89,903 shares of the Company s
common stock, equal to 4.0% of the Company s outstanding common stock at the time.  The program allows the Company to
repurchase common stock at various prices in the open market or through private transactions.  The actual amount and timing
of future repurchases, if any, will depend on market conditions, applicable SEC rules and various other factors. 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the
Company repurchased 23,100 shares of common stock, at an average cost of $12.89. 

During the nine month period ending September
30, 2016 (unaudited), a total of 42,000 shares of common stock were repurchased at an average cost of $13.10. 

NOTE 12   EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS  

On November 24, 2015, stockholders of the
Company approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ( 2015 EIP ). The 2015 EIP provides for the award of up to 314,661
shares of common stock pursuant to grants of restricted stock awards and stock options. Pursuant to the terms of the 2015 EIP,
on June 1, 2016, the Board of Directors granted 70,950 shares of restricted stock and 169,500 stock options to employees and directors.
Of the 70,950 shares of restricted stock granted, 47,600 shares vest evenly over a five year period and 23,350 shares vest over
a four year period. Of the 169,500 stock options granted, 122,500 options vest evenly over a five year period and 47,000 options
vest over a four year period. The maximum term of each option is ten years. At September 30, 2016, there were 18,953 restricted
stock awards and 55,258 stock options available for future grants.  

The fair value of each option awarded for
the 2015 EIP is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing Model. The expected life represents the
period of time that the option is expected to be outstanding, taking into account the contractual term and the vesting period.
The expected volatility is based on peer group volatility because the Company does not have sufficient trading history. The dividend
yield is based on the Company s expectation of no dividend payouts. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield
curve in effect at the date of the grant for a period equivalent to the expected life of the option. 

The weighted average assumptions used and
fair value for options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited) are as follows:

related to this expense was $18,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited), the Company recognized restricted
stock related compensation expense of $60,000, and the recognized tax benefit related to this expense was $24,000.  

Item 2.             
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

General   

Management s discussion and analysis
of the financial condition and results of operations at and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is
intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained
in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto, appearing in Part
I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

This Report contains forward-looking statements,
which can be identified by the use of words such as  estimate,   project,   believe,   intend, 
 anticipate,   assume,   plan,   seek,   expect,   will, 
 may,   should,   indicate,   would,   contemplate,   continue, 
 target  and words of similar meaning.  These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 

statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; 

statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth
and operating strategies; 

statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and
investment portfolios; and 

estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. 

These forward-looking statements are based
on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties
and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control.  In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions
with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change.  We are under no duty to and do not take
any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Report. 

The following factors, among others, could
cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 

our ability to manage our operations under the current
adverse economic conditions nationally and in our market area; 

adverse changes in the financial industry, securities,
credit and national and local real estate markets (including real estate values); 

significant increases in our loan losses, including as
a result of our inability to resolve classified and non-performing assets or reduce risks associated with our loans, and management s
assumptions in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; 

credit risks of lending activities, including changes in
the level and trend of loan delinquencies and write-offs and in our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses; 

competition among depository and other financial institutions; 

our success in implementing our business strategy, particularly
increasing our commercial real estate, multi-family, non-owner occupied residential and construction lending; 

our success in introducing new financial products; 

our ability to attract and maintain deposits; 

our ability to continue to improve our asset quality even
as we increase our non-residential and non-owner occupied residential lending; 

changes in interest rates generally, including changes
in the relative differences between short term and long term interest rates and in deposit interest rates, that may affect our
net interest margin and funding sources; 

fluctuations in the demand for loans, which may be affected
by the number of unsold homes, land and other properties in our market areas and by declines in the value of real estate in our
market area; 

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits; 

declines in the yield on our assets resulting from the
current low interest rate environment; 

risks related to a high concentration of loans secured
by real estate located in our market area; 

the results of examinations by our regulators, including
the possibility that our regulators may, among other things, require us to increase our reserve for loan losses, write down assets,
change our regulatory capital position, limit our ability to borrow funds or maintain or increase deposits, or prohibit us from
paying dividends, which could adversely affect our dividends and earnings; 

changes in the level of government support of housing finance; 

our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize
on growth opportunities; 

changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting
financial institutions, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the JOBS Act, which could result in, among other things, increased deposit
insurance premiums and assessments, capital requirements (particularly the new capital regulations), regulatory fees and compliance
costs and the resources we have available to address such changes; 

changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be
adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; 

changes in our organization, compensation and benefit plans,
and our ability to retain key members of our senior management team and to address staffing needs in response to product demand
or to implement our strategic plans; 

loan delinquencies and changes in the underlying cash flows
of our borrowers; 

our ability to control costs and expenses, particularly
those associated with operating as a publicly traded company; 

the failure or security breaches of computer systems on
which we depend; 

the ability of key third-party service providers to perform
their obligations to us; 

changes in the financial condition or future prospects
of issuers of securities that we own; and 

other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and
operational factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services described elsewhere in this Report. 

Because of these and a wide variety of
other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking
statements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no material changes to the critical accounting policies
disclosed in Pilgrim Bancshares, Inc. s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on March 28, 2016. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 (unaudited)
and December 31, 2015  

Total assets increased $40.4 million, or
19.2%, to $250.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $210.5 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase
in loans.  

Total cash and cash equivalents increased
$1.2 million, or 11.5%, to $11.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $10.7 million at December 31, 2015.  The increase in cash
resulted from the timing of normal cash flows. 

Net loans increased $37.1 million, or 21.8%,
to $207.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $170.4 million at December 31, 2015.  The Company originated $60.2 million and
purchased $29.2 million of new loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Partially offsetting the loan originations
and purchases were $35.0 million of loan payoffs and amortization, $7.2 million of loans and loan participations sold and $10.1
million of unadvanced funds on loans originated during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Investment securities classified as available-for-sale
increased $1.0 million, or 6.3%, to $17.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $16.6 million at December 31, 2015, due to the purchase
of U.S. government and agency securities.  Investment securities classified as held-to-maturity decreased $13,000, or 10.8%,
to $107,000 at September 30, 2016, from $120,000 at December 31, 2015 due to payments in the ordinary course of business and a
payoff of one security.  

Bank-owned life insurance at September
30, 2016 increased $31,000, or 1.4%, compared to December 31, 2015 due to normal increases in cash surrender value. 

Deposits increased $12.1 million, or 7.1%,
to $181.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $169.4 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to a $12.1 million increase in
certificates of deposit, a $3.2 million increase in noninterest-bearing demand accounts, a $1.3 million increase in savings accounts,
a $1.5 million increase in Money Market accounts, and a $2.4 million decrease in NOW accounts. Our core deposits, which we consider
to be our noninterest-bearing demand accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts, collectively increased
$3.7 million, or 4.2%, to $89.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $86.1 million at December 31, 2015.  

FHLB advances increased $27.9 million,
or 327.9%, to $36.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $8.5 million at December 31, 2015, to fund loan growth.  FHLB advances
as of September 30, 2016 consisted of short and long term borrowings. 

Stockholders  equity increased $343,000,
or 1.1%, to $32.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $32.0 million at December 31, 2015.  The increase was driven by $617,000
of net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $122,000 in other comprehensive income, due to an increase in the
net unrealized gain position of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Partially offsetting the increase was the
purchase and retirement of 42,000 shares of the Company s common stock at a cost of $550,000. 

Delinquent Loans.    The following table sets
forth our loan delinquencies by type and amount at the dates indicated. 

The decrease in total delinquent loans
90 days or more past due from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 was the result of the payoff of one loan in the amount of
$1.4 million. 

Classified Assets  . 
The following table sets forth our amounts of classified assets and assets designated as special mention as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015.  

(1) Includes $1.4 million of non-accruing
loans that were more than 90 days past due at December 31, 2015. 

The decrease in classified assets from
December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 was the result of the payoff of one non-accruing loan in the amount of $1.4 million, the
upgrade of two loans totaling $2.5 million from  substandard  to  special mention,  and normal amortization. 

Non-Performing Assets  . 
The following table sets forth information regarding our non-performing assets and troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated. 
The information reflects net charge-offs but not specific reserves.  Troubled debt restructurings include loans where the
borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and for which either a portion of interest or principal has been forgiven or an extension
of term granted, or for which the loans were modified at interest rates materially less than current market rates. 

The decrease in non-performing
assets from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 was the result of the payoff of a non-accruing loan totaling $1.4 million. 

Non-performing loans totaled $11,000 at
September 30, 2016, and consisted of one owner occupied one- to four- family residential loan. We had no non-performing commercial
real estate and multi-family loans at September 30, 2016.  We had no foreclosed real estate at September 30, 2016. 

Interest income that would have been recorded
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, had the one non-accruing loan been current according to its original terms, amounted
to less than $1,000.  

Other Loans of Concern.    
There were no other loans at September 30, 2016 that are not already disclosed where there is information about possible credit
problems of borrowers that caused management to have serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan
repayment terms and that may result in disclosure of such loans in the future. 

Comparison of Operating Results for
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015   

General  .  Net income
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $276,000, compared to net income of $203,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase of $73,000, or 36.0%, in net income was due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by an
increase in provision for loan losses, and an increase in noninterest expense. 

Interest and Dividend Income.   
Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $422,000, or 23.8%, to $2.2 million
compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest and dividend income was the result
of higher average loans in the three months ended September 30, 2016. The average balance of loans during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 increased $43.5 million to $204.3 million from $160.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015,
while the average yield on loans decreased 7 basis points to 4.15% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.22% for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The average balance of investment securities increased $1.8 million to $16.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $14.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and the yield on
investment securities (on a tax-equivalent basis) decreased 60 basis points to 1.41% for the three months ended September 30, 2016
from 2.01% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.    

Interest Expense  .  Total
interest expense increased $158,000, or 59.0%, to $426,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $268,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015.  Interest expense on interest-bearing deposit accounts increased $107,000, or 42.8%,
to $357,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $250,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The
increase was primarily due to higher average deposit balances and overall changes in the deposit mix. 

Interest expense on FHLB advances increased
$51,000, or 283.3%, to $69,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $18,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015.  The average balance of advances increased $19.4 million, or 199.4%, to $29.2 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The cost of funds on FHLB advances increased
19 basis points to 0.92% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.73% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Interest and Dividend Income  . 
Net interest and dividend income increased $264,000, or 17.6%, to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
$1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest and dividend income increased
$259,000, or 17.1%, to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.5 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015.  The tax-equivalent basis increase resulted from a $417,000 increase in interest income, partially offset
by a $158,000 increase in interest expense.  Our average interest-earning assets increased $48.7 million to $232.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $183.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Our net
interest rate spread decreased 25 basis points to 2.89% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.14% for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, and our net interest margin decreased 25 basis points to 3.05% for the three months ended September
30, 2016 from 3.30% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in our interest rate spread and net interest
margin reflected a reduction in the average yield on loans and higher average balances of certificates of deposit and Federal Home
Loan Bank advances. 

Provision for
Loan Losses.    We recorded a provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $62,000, compared
to a provision of $36,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.    We maintain the allowance for loan
losses at levels we believe are adequate to cover our estimate of probable credit losses as of the end of the reporting period. 
There were no charge-offs recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan
losses was $1.0 million, or 0.49% of total loans at September 30, 2016, compared to $839,000, or 0.51% of total loans at September
30, 2015.  

Noninterest Income  . 
Noninterest income decreased $1,000, or 0.6%, to $155,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $156,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  The slight decrease was spread across various categories.  

Noninterest Expense  . 
Noninterest expense increased $97,000, or 7.4%, to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.3
million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $98,000 in salaries
and benefits expense, due to staff merit increases and equity incentive compensation. Additionally, professional fees increased
$8,000, occupancy expense decreased $14,000, and all other noninterest expenses increased $5,000, spread across various categories.    

Income Taxes.    Income
before income taxes of $460,000 resulted in income tax expense of $184,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to income before income taxes of $320,000 resulting in an income tax expense of $117,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The effective income tax rate was 40.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 36.6% for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. 

Comparison of Operating Results for
the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015   

General  .  Net income
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $617,000, compared to net income of $438,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015.  The increase of $179,000, or 40.9%, in net income, was due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset
by an increase in provision for loan losses, and an increase in noninterest expense. 

Interest and Dividend Income.   
Total interest and dividend income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $928,000, or 18.3%, to $6.0 million compared
to $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest and dividend income was the result of higher
average loans in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The average balance of loans during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 increased $30.5 million to $185.8 million from $155.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, while the
average yield on loans decreased five basis points to 4.11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.16% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The average balance of investment securities increased $3.5 million to $16.9 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 from $13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and the yield on investment securities
(on a tax-equivalent basis) decreased 50 basis points to 1.62% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 2.12% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015.    

Interest Expense  .  Total
interest expense increased $377,000, or 48.6%, to $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $775,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Interest expense on interest-bearing deposit accounts increased $303,000, or 41.5%,
to $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $730,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
The increase was primarily due to higher average deposit balances and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and overall changes in the
deposit mix. 

Interest expense on FHLB advances increased
$74,000, or 164.4%, to $119,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $45,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015.  The average balance of advances increased $8.0 million, or 97.0%, to $16.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 from $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The cost of funds on FHLB advances increased 22
basis points to 0.97% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.75% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Interest and Dividend Income  . 
Net interest and dividend income increased $551,000, or 12.9%, to $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from
$4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest and dividend income increased
$541,000, or 12.5%, to $4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $4.3 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015.  The tax-equivalent basis increase resulted from a $918,000 increase in interest income, partially offset by a $377,000
increase in interest expense.  Our average interest-earning assets increased $35.9 million to $215.9 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 from $180.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Our net interest rate spread
decreased 20 basis points to 2.85% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.05% for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, and our net interest margin decreased 19 basis points to 3.00% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.19%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in our interest rate spread and net interest margin reflected
higher average balances of certificates of deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and related cost of funds. 

Provision
for Loan Losses.    We recorded a provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $134,000,
compared to a provision of $96,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    We maintain the allowance for
loan losses at levels we believe are adequate to cover our estimate of probable credit losses as of the end of the reporting period. 
There was a charge-off of $7,000 related to a consumer loan for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. No charge-offs were recognized
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The allowance for loan losses was $1.0 million, or 0.49% of total loans at September
30, 2016, compared to $839,000, or 0.51% of total loans at September 30, 2015.  

Noninterest Income  .

million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $208,000 in salaries
and benefits expense, due to staff merit increases and equity incentive compensation. Additionally, data processing expense increased
$27,000 and occupancy expense decreased $52,000.     

Income Taxes.    Income
before income taxes of $1.0 million resulted in income tax expense of $389,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to income before income taxes of $676,000 resulting in an income tax expense of $238,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The effective income tax rate was 38.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 35.2% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. 

Average Balances
and Yields.    The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information
for the periods indicated.  Tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made because we had tax-exempt interest-earning assets
during the periods.  All average balances are daily average balances based upon amortized costs.  Non-accrual loans were
included in the computation of average balances.  The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts,
and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. 

(1)  Yields and rates are annualized. 

(3)  Net interest rate spread represents the difference between
the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate of interest-bearing liabilities. 

(4)  Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning
assets less total interest-bearing liabilities. 

(5)  Net interest margin represents net interest income divided
by average total interest-earning assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our primary sources of funds are deposits,
principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, proceeds from maturities and calls of
securities, maturities of certificate of deposit investments and FHLB advances.  While maturities and scheduled amortization
of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general
interest rates, economic conditions, and competition.  Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including
interest-bearing demand deposits.  The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing
activities during any given period. 

Our cash flows are comprised of three primary
classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.  Net cash provided
by operating activities was $952,000 and $987,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of disbursements
for the purchase of loans, the origination of loans, and the purchase of available-for-sale securities, offset by principal collections
on loans, proceeds from loan sales, proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities. Net cash used
in investing activities was $39.2 million and $20.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
respectively.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we purchased $6.3 million of securities held as available-for-sale
securities, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we purchased $4.4 million of securities held as available-for-sale.
We sold $1.2 million and $0 of securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash
provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of the activity in deposit accounts and FHLB advances, was $39.4 million
and $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. 

At September 30, 2016, we exceeded all
 well capitalized  regulatory capital requirements with a CET1 capital level of $23.0 million or 13.8% of risk-weighted
assets, which is above the required level of $10.8 million, or 6.5% of risk-weighted assets; a tier 1 capital level of $23.0 million,
or 13.8% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the required level of $13.4 million, or 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; a tier 1
leverage capital level of $23.0 million, or 9.5% of average assets, which is above the required level of $12.2 million, or 5.0%
of average assets; and total risk-based capital of $24.0 million, or 14.4% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the required
level of $16.7 million, or 10.0% of risk-weighted assets. At December 31, 2015, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements
with a CET1 capital level of $22.2 million, or 15.6% of risk-weighted assets, which was the above the required level of $9.3 million,
or 6.5% of risk-weighted assets; a tier 1 capital level of $ 22.2 million, or 15.6% of risk-weighted assets which is above the
required level of $11.4 million, or 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; a tier 1 leverage capital level of $22.2 million, or 10.9% of
average assets, which is above the required level of $10.2 million, or 5.0% of average assets; and a total risk-based capital of
$23.1 million, or 16.2% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the required level of $14.3 million, or 10.0% of risk-weighted
assets.  Accordingly, Pilgrim Bank was categorized as well capitalized at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.     

At September 30, 2016,
we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $8.3 million, commitments to purchase loans of $2.2 million, and unadvanced
funds on loans of $21.8 million.  We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination,
loan purchase and securities purchase commitments.  Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one
year from September 30, 2016 totaled $59.0 million.  Management expects, based on historical experience, that a substantial
portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed.  However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not
retained, we may utilize FHLB advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher
levels of interest expense. 

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements.     In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial
transactions that, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. 
These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk.  Such transactions are
used primarily to manage customers  requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, lines of credit and standby
letters of credit.  These arrangements are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial condition
or results of operations.  

We have not engaged in
any other off-balance sheet transactions in the normal course of our lending activities. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk  

Quantitative and qualitative disclosures
about market risk are not required by smaller reporting companies, such as the Company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2016. 
Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,
concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

During the quarter ended September 30,
