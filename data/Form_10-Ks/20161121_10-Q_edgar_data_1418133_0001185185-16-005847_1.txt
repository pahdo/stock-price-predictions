NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1     ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS  

Biostar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Biostar  or the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Maryland on March 27, 2007. On June 15, 2007, Biostar formed Shaanxi Biostar Biotech Ltd. ( Shaanxi Biostar ). Shaanxi Biostar is a wholly owned subsidiary of Biostar and a limited liability company organized under the laws of the People s Republic of China (the  PRC ).

On November 1, 2007, Shaanxi Biostar entered into a series of agreements including a Management Entrustment Agreement, a Shareholders  Voting Proxy Agreement, an Exclusive Option Agreement and a Share Pledge Agreement (collectively the  Agreements ) with Shaanxi Aoxing Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ( Aoxing Pharmaceutical ) and its registered owners (the  Transaction ). Aoxing Pharmaceutical is a corporation formed under the laws of the PRC. According to these Agreements, Shaanxi Biostar acquired management control of Aoxing Pharmaceutical whereby Shaanxi Biostar is entitled to all of the net profits of Aoxing Pharmaceutical as a management fee and is obligated to fund Aoxing Pharmaceutical s operations and pay all of the debts. In exchange for entering into the Agreements, on November 1, 2007, the Company issued 19,832,311 shares (representing 944,396 shares, after the one-for-three reverse split of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company effective on April 3, 2012 and the one-for-seven reverse split of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company effective on February 4, 2016) of its common stock to Aoxing Pharmaceutical s registered owners, representing approximately 90% of the Company s common stock outstanding immediately after the Transaction.

Following the change in registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical on July 9, 2010, a set of new Agreements had been entered into with all the then existing registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical on the same day.

The Agreements dated July 9, 2010 were merely replacements of the Agreements dated November 1, 2007 and therefore, there was no significant change in the contractual terms between the Agreements dated July 9, 2010 and November 1, 2007. The then existing registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical, Shaanxi Biostar and Biostar had mutually agreed that no consideration would be paid / payable upon the execution of the Agreements on July 9, 2010. The interest of Biostar in Aoxing Pharmaceutical was not and would not be affected by the replacement for the Agreements.

Following the change in registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical on May 24, 2013, a set of new Agreements had been entered into with all the existing registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical on May 24, 2013.

The Agreements dated May 24, 2013 are merely replacements of the Agreements dated July 9, 2010 and therefore, there is no significant change in the contractual terms between the Agreements dated May 24, 2013, July 9, 2010 and November 1, 2007. The existing registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical, Shaanxi Biostar and Biostar had mutually agreed that no consideration would be paid / payable upon the execution of the Agreements on May 23, 2013. The interest of Biostar in Aoxing Pharmaceutical was not and would not be affected by the replacement for the Agreements.

Following the change in registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical on October 29, 2014, a set of new Agreements had been entered into with all the existing registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical on October 29, 2014.

The Agreements dated October 29, 2014 are merely replacements of the Agreements dated May 24, 2013 and therefore, there is no significant change in the contractual terms between the Agreements dated October 29, 2014, May 24, 2013, July 9, 2010 and November 1, 2007. The existing registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical, Shaanxi Biostar and Biostar had mutually agreed that no consideration would be paid / payable upon the execution of the Agreements on October 29, 2014. The interest of Biostar in Aoxing Pharmaceutical was not and would not be affected by the replacement for the Agreements.

Following the change in registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical on May 11, 2015, a set of new Agreements had been entered into with all the existing registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical on May 11, 2015.

The Agreements dated May 11, 2015 are merely replacements of the Agreements dated October 29, 2014 and therefore, there is no significant change in the contractual terms between the Agreements dated May 11, 2015, October 29, 2014, May 24, 2013, July 9, 2010 and November 1, 2007. The existing registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical, Shaanxi Biostar and Biostar had mutually agreed that no consideration would be paid / payable upon the execution of the Agreements on May 11, 2015. The interest of Biostar in Aoxing Pharmaceutical was not and would not be affected by the replacement for the Agreements.

The Agreements provide Shaanxi Biostar with control over Aoxing Pharmaceutical as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810,  Consolidation , which requires Shaanxi Biostar to consolidate the financial statements of Aoxing Pharmaceutical and ultimately consolidate with its parent company, Biostar (see Note 2  Principles of Consolidation ).

In October 2011, Aoxing Pharmaceutical entered into and completed a Share Transfer Agreement (the  Weinan Share Transfer Agreement ) to acquire Shaanxi Weinan Huaren Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. ( Shaanxi Weinan ) from the holders of 100% of equity interests in Shaanxi Weinan.  Therefore, Shaanxi Weinan became a wholly owned subsidiary of Aoxing Pharmaceutical. Shaanxi Weinan is engaged in manufacturing of drugs and health products.  In April 2013, Aoxing Pharmaceutical executed a supplemental agreement to the Weinan Share Transfer Agreement (the  Weinan Supplemental Agreement ) with all the former equity holders of Shaanxi Weinan to acquire 13 drug approval numbers which were excluded from the Weinan Share Transfer Agreement due to incomplete re-registration.  The Company acquired ownership of the 13 drug approval numbers for which re-registration has been completed in April 2013. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $10.2 million, consisting of approximately $8.8 million in cash and 228,938 shares (after the one-for-seven reverse split of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company effective on February 4, 2016) of the Company s common stock, valued at approximately $1.4 million. 

The Company, through its subsidiary and the Agreements with Aoxing Pharmaceutical, is engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing and marketing over-the-counter ( OTC ) and prescription pharmaceutical products in the PRC.

Note 2 -   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).

Liquidity and Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash of $659,359 and net working capital of $759,717. For the period ended September 30, 2016, we reported a net loss of $9,086,460 and net cash provided by operating activities of $911,057. We generated cash flow from operations even though we incurred a net loss as (1) we collected outstanding receivables from our trade debtors; and (2) our net loss includes certain non-cash expenses that are added back to our cash flow from operations as shown on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

We had experienced a substantial decrease in sales volume of all Aoxing Pharmaceutical Products due to the temporarily suspension of production to conduct maintenance of its production lines to renew its GMP certificates from 2015. While our production levels of Shaanxi Weinan products, being sold to a single customer as detailed in Note 13, helped to offset the substantial decrease in our sales volume in the most recent fiscal quarter, our sales volume continued to remain at the present decreased levels. There is no assurance that the production lines at Aoxing will resume and the renewal of GMP certificates will occur when anticipated, or even if they are renewed, we will be able to return to the production levels as anticipated. Our inability to regain our production levels as anticipated may have material adverse effects on our business, operations and financial performance, and the Company may become insolvent. In addition, the Company already violated its financial covenants included in its short-term bank loans as discussed in Note 5  Short-term Bank Loans .

During 2015, as a result of outstanding personal debts of the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ronghua Wang, one of the Company s bank accounts was frozen, title of three residential properties of the Company had been transferred and resulted in a loss of approximately $0.5 million (RMB 3.3 million), and certain buildings and land use rights are currently seized by the court but have not been transferred to the lender. In February 2016, the count attempted to force a sale of the Company s land use rights and buildings. As of September 30, 2016, Mr. Ronghua Wang had partially repaid the outstanding balance of the loan, thus the creditor petitioned the court to terminate the auction sale. Mr. Ronghua Wang has repaid approximately $0.5 million (RMB 3.3 million) to the company to make good the loss recognized in 2015. Such cash collection is included in  other income  for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The Company has disclosed the above legal proceedings related to the Company to the best of its knowledge. There is no assurance that Mr. Ronghua Wang will be able to repay his personal debts in full before his creditors take any other further legal action. There is also no assurance that there will be no other cases that would put the Company s properties at risk. 

The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current plans for the next twelve months, we anticipate that the sales of the Company s pharmaceutical products in Shaanxi Weinan after having recently gained renewal of its GMP certificates, will be the primary organic source of funds for future operating activities in 2016. The Company will also make substantial efforts to collect outstanding accounts and other receivables to meet its debt obligations; we may also try to procure bank borrowing, if available, as well as capital raises through public or private offerings. There is no assurance that we will find such funding on acceptable terms, if at all. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.

We anticipate that the new topical health product called  Easy Breathing  will be launched for sale in November 2016. The product was developed by the Company s research and development team over the past 3 years. The product is designed to have effects of relieving stuffy nose, inhibiting nasal bacteria and viruses, and mitigating effects on the inflammation of nasal mucosa. It will be manufactured, distributed and sold in China. Although we do not anticipate any significant sales revenue in 2016, we expect to sell approximately 400,000 units within the next 2 years, which is expected to yield approximately $7.5 million (RMB 50 million) and improve our cash flow position.

Principles of Consolidation 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary and variable interest entity ( VIE ) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in those condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company has adopted ASC 810,  Consolidation  which requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and either (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or (2) the right to receive benefits from the VIE .

In determining Aoxing Pharmaceutical is a VIE of Shaanxi Biostar, the Company considered the following indicators, among others:

Shaanxi Biostar has the full right to control and administer the financial affairs and daily operation of Aoxing Pharmaceutical and has the right to manage and control all assets of Aoxing Pharmaceutical. The registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical as a group have no right to make any decision about Aoxing Pharmaceutical s activities without the consent of Shaanxi Biostar.

Shaanxi Biostar is assigned all voting rights of Aoxing Pharmaceutical and has the right to appoint all directors and senior management personnel of Aoxing Pharmaceutical. The registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical possess no substantive voting rights.

Shaanxi Biostar is committed to provide financial support if Aoxing Pharmaceutical requires additional funds to maintain its operations and to repay its debts.

Shaanxi Biostar is entitled to a management fee equal to Aoxing Pharmaceutical s net profits and is obligated to assume all operation risks and bear all losses of Aoxing Pharmaceutical.  Therefore, Shaanxi Biostar is the primary beneficiary of Aoxing Pharmaceutical.

Additional capital provided to Aoxing Pharmaceutical by the Company was recorded as an interest-free loan to Aoxing Pharmaceutical. There was no written note to this loan, the loan was not interest bearing, and was eliminated during consolidation. Under the terms of the Agreements, the registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical are required to transfer their ownership of Aoxing Pharmaceutical to the Company s subsidiary in the PRC when permitted by the PRC laws and regulations or to designees of the Company at any time when the Company considers it is necessary to acquire Aoxing Pharmaceutical. In addition, the registered owners of Aoxing Pharmaceutical have pledged their shares in Aoxing Pharmaceutical as collateral to secure these Agreements.

Unaudited Interim Financial Information 

These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial reporting and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. Therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented have been made. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

The consolidated balance sheets and certain comparative information as of December 31, 2015 are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015 Annual Financial Statements ), included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 2015 Annual Financial Statements.

Foreign Currency 

The Company s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar ( $ ). The Company s operations in the PRC use the Chinese Yuan Renminbi ( RMB ) as its functional currency. The financial statements of the subsidiary and VIEs are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830,  Foreign Currency Matters . According to the topic, all assets and liabilities were translated at the current exchange rate, stockholders  equity are translated at the historical rates and income statement items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income in accordance with ASC 220,  Comprehensive Income . Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are reflected in the statement of operations.  For the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized foreign translation under other comprehensive income adjustment of a loss for $1,152,031 and a loss for $2,479,077, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires that the Company discloses estimated fair values of financial instruments. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for current assets and current liabilities qualifying as financial instruments are a reasonable estimate of fair value.

The Company applies the provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. For certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, loan receivables and short-term bank loans, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

The Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives. The effects of interactions between embedded derivatives are calculated and accounted for in arriving at the overall fair value of the financial instruments. In addition, the fair values of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrant are valued using the Binominal Model.

The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for the fair value of warrant.

The binomial lattice relies on the following Level 3 inputs: (1) expected volatility of the Company s common stock; and (2) risk free rate which is based on daily treasury yield curve rates as published by U.S. Department of the Treasury. The expected volatility of the Company s common stock is estimated from the historical volatility of daily returns in the Company s common stock price.

The following tables present the estimated fair value of the following financial assets and liabilities of the Company:

At September 30, 2016  :

F-8 

Table of Contents 

At December 31, 2015  :

At September 30, 2016, the fair value of the warrants liability, which are recognized as level 3 financial instruments, were calculated using the binomial model that included the following inputs: stock price of the underlying asset of $3.72, an exercise price of $22.61 expected volatility of 149.91%, risk free rate of 0.37% and initial time to expiration of 3 years. The change in fair value was recognized on the Company s statement of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

In accordance with ASC-820-10-50-2(g), the Company has performed a sensitivity analysis of the outstanding warrants of the Company which are classified as level 3 financial instruments. The Company recalculated the value of warrants by applying a +/- 5% changes to the input variables in the binomial model that vary overtime, namely, the volatility and the risk free rate. A 5.0% decrease in volatility would decrease the value of the warrants to $3,162; a 5.0% increase in volatility would increase the value of the warrants to $3,669. A 5.0% decrease or increase in the risk free rate would not have materially changed the value of the warrants; the value of the warrants is not strongly correlated with small changes in interest rates.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with the GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for certain items such as allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization, impairment, inventory allowance, taxes and contingencies.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and cash in time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents were mainly denominated in RMB and were placed with banks in the PRC.  These cash and cash equivalents may not be freely convertible into foreign currencies and the remittance of these funds out of the PRC may be subjected to exchange control restrictions imposed by the PRC government.

Table of Contents 

Accounts Receivable 

The Company maintains allowance for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these allowances. Terms of sales vary. Allowances are recorded primarily on a specific identification basis.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for doubtful debts was approximately $14.3 million and $6.8 million respectively.

Reverse Stock Split 

On February 4, 2016, the Company effectuated a one-for-seven reverse split of its common stock; the Company s stockholder s equity, information on a number of shares and (loss) earnings per share has been retroactively restated to the first period presented. See Note 6(a).

Inventories 

Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market. Management compares the cost of inventories with the market value, and allowance is made for writing down the inventories to market value, if lower. Inventories consisted of the following:

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for substantially all assets with estimated lives of:

Buildings

30 years

Building improvements

30 years

Machinery   equipment

5-10 years

Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from ten to fifty years. Management evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and takes into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate impairment exists. The Company s land use rights will expire between 2053 and 2056. The Company s proprietary technologies include land use rights and drug approvals and permits. All of the Company s intangible assets are subject to amortization with estimated useful lives of:

Land use rights

50 years

Proprietary technologies

10 years

Recent accounting pronouncements 

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2019, and early adoption is permitted. Subsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations ( ASU 2016-08  ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ( ASU 2016-10  and ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients ( ASU 2016-12 ). The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the  new revenue standards ). The new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company currently expects to adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2018 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The adoption of the new revenue standards is not expected to have any material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2015-02,  Consolidation  (Topic 810). ASU 2015-02 changes the guidance with respect to the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation mode. ASU 2015-02 affects the following areas: (1) Limited partnerships and similar legal entities. (2) Evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider as a variable interest. (3) The effect of fee arrangements on the primary beneficiary determination. (4) The effect of related parties on the primary beneficiary determination. (5) Certain investment funds. ASU 2015-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the guidance in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this guidance using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have any material impact on the Company s financial statement presentation or disclosures.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . The accounting guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be reported on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The guidance is effective for the Company retrospectively beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have any material impact on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost. Under the updated guidance, an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out ( LIFO ). ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company will adopt the standard in the interim and annual period after December 31, 2016.

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Updates ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ). The FASB issued ASU 2015-17 as part of its ongoing Simplification Initiative, with the objective of reducing complexity in accounting standards. The amendments in ASU 2015-17 require entities that present a classified balance sheet to classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as a noncurrent amount. This guidance does not change the offsetting requirements for deferred tax liabilities and assets, which results in the presentation of one amount on the balance sheet. Additionally, the amendments in this ASU align the deferred income tax presentation with the requirements in International Accounting Standards (IAS) 1, Presentation of Financial Statements.  The amendments in ASU 2015-17 are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU 2015-17 to determine if there will be any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Updates ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 will also require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU 2016-02 to determine if there will be any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The objective of the simplification initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of US GAAP for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The areas for simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for public companies for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is assessing the impact to its accounting practices and financial reporting procedures as a result of the issuance of this standard.

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have any material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . The updated guidance aims to reduce diversity in presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments by addressing eight specific cash flow issues including (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination; (4) Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned Life Insurance Policies; (6) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees; (7) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions and (8) Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. Among the afore-mentioned eight addressed cash flow issues, the category of  Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle  requires a reporting entity to classify cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows first by applying specific guidance in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and, only in the absence of specific guidance, by determining each separately identifiable source or use within the cash receipts and cash payments on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows. In situations in which cash receipts and payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated by source or use, a reporting entity should classify such cash receipts and cash payments by referring to the predominant source or use of cash flows for the item. The updated guidance is effective from reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is assessing the impact to its accounting practices and financial reporting procedures as a result of the issuance of this standard.

Overview

Biostar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( we , the  Company  or  Biostar ) was incorporated on March 27, 2007 in the State of Maryland. Our business operation is conducted in China primarily through our variable interest entity ( VIE ), Shaanxi Aoxing Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ( Aoxing Pharmaceutical ), which we control through contractual arrangements between Aoxing Pharmaceutical and our wholly owned subsidiary, Shaanxi Biostar Biotech Ltd. ( Shaanxi Biostar ). Shaanxi Weinan owns 99 drug approvals.

Prior to suspension of our production in order to conduct maintenance of such lines to renew our GMP certificates (as discussed below), we manufactured and sold twelve over-the-counter ( OTC ) medications and seventeen prescription-based pharmaceuticals which were sold and distributed in over 25 provinces and provincial-level cities throughout China.

When we sell our equity or borrow funds, we expect the proceeds will be forwarded to Aoxing Pharmaceutical and accounted for as a loan to Aoxing Pharmaceutical and eliminated during consolidation. If we borrow funds, we expect to be the primary obligor on any debt.

Neither Biostar nor Shaanxi Biostar has any operations or plans to have any operations in the future other than acting as a holding company and management company for Aoxing Pharmaceutical and raising capital for its operations. However, we reserve the right to change our operating plans regarding Biostar and Shaanxi Biostar.

Gross profit decreased by approximately $9.4 million or 90.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in gross profit was due primarily to the decrease in sales volume.

The overall gross profit margin maintained at approximately the same level for the same period in 2015.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses decreased by approximately $0.2 million or 9.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period last year.

In anticipation of reduced sales volume as result of decreased production capacity, the Company significantly reduced its advertising and research activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016; however, as a result of the future roll-out of the Company s new  Easy Breathing  nasal product, management is currently formulating its budget for future advertising and research spend. 

Selling expenses consist mostly of salesman salaries, commission and other selling expenses.  Overall decrease was approximately $0.5 million or 65.2%.  The Company s accrued selling expenses are correlated with the Company s sales; accordingly, with the reduced sales as function of the maintenance of the production line, the Company s selling expenses decreased as well.

General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and wages, amortization and depreciation, stock-based compensation and other general and administrative expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.2 million or 28.5% due to the decrease in staff salary and welfare.

Total operating expenses decreased by approximately $3.6 million or 25.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period last year.

In anticipation of reduced sales volume as result of decreased production capacity, the Company significantly reduced its advertising and research activities during the first nine months ended September 30, 2016; however, as a result of the future roll-out of the Company s new  Easy Breathing  nasal product, management is currently formulating its budget for future advertising and research spend.

Selling expenses consist mostly of salesman salaries, commission and other selling expenses.  Overall decrease was approximately $3.5 million or 79.7%.  The Company s accrued selling expenses are correlated with the Company s sales; accordingly, with the reduced sales as function of the maintenance of the production line, the Company s selling expenses decreased as well.

General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and wages, amortization and depreciation, stock-based compensation and other general and administrative expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.0 million or 35.7% due to the     decrease in staff salary and welfare. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had no income tax expense nor income tax benefit. We are subject to the uniform corporate income tax rate of 25% in China. The calculation of effective tax rate includes the operating results of all our subsidiaries and the U.S. parent company.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.7 million and net working capital of approximately $0.8 million.  Collection of receivables and lower production capacity from preparation for further GMP renewal certification at our Aoxing facility led to weak results in generating cash flows during the fiscal year. We have been working with the bank to extend the outstanding loans, trying to collect as much account receivables as possible, and restoring production volumes to regular levels; however, as of the time of this filing, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully extend our loans and restore all production to regular volumes. The Company s short-term bank loan is due on demand and the Company is in negotiations to extend this loan.  As of September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were mainly denominated in RMB and were placed with banks in the PRC.  These cash and cash equivalents may not be freely convertible into foreign currencies and the remittance of these funds out of the PRC may be subjected to exchange control restrictions imposed by the PRC government.

On an on-going basis, we take steps to identify and plan our needs for liquidity and capital resources, to fund our operations and day to day business operations. Our future capital expenditures will include, among others, expanding product lines, research and development capabilities, and making acquisitions as deemed appropriate.

Based on our current plans for the next twelve months, we anticipate that the sales of the Company s pharmaceutical products in Shaanxi Weinan after having recently gained renewal of its GMP certificates, as well as proceeds of the most recently completed capital raise in October 2016 will be the primary organic source of funds for future operating activities in 2016 and beyond. The Company will also make substantial efforts to collect outstanding accounts and other receivables to meet its debt obligations; we may also try to procure bank borrowing, if available, as well as capital raises through public or private offerings. There is no assurance that we will find such funding on acceptable terms, if at all. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.

We anticipate that the new topical health product called  Easy Breathing  will be launched for sale in November 2016. The product was developed by the Company s research and development team over the past 3 years. The product is designed to have effects of relieving stuffy nose, inhibiting nasal bacteria and viruses, and mitigating effects on the inflammation of nasal mucosa. It will be manufactured, distributed and sold in China. We do not expect any substantial revenue from sales of this product in 2016.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.1 million when comparing the same level for the same period.

Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $0.3 million which was the result of the Company s repayment of short term bank borrowings. 

Critical Accounting Policies

We believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements:

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of customer accounts and management s best estimate of the likelihood of potential loss, taking into account such factors as the financial condition and payment history of major customers. Management evaluates the collectability of the receivables at least quarterly. If the financial condition of a customer was to deteriorate further, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.  Such differences could be material and could significantly impact cash flows from operating activities.

The following are steps the Company takes in collecting accounts receivable:

Step 1: After the payment term has been exceeded, the Company stops taking orders from the delinquent customer and allows the responsible sales person three to six months to collect the accounts receivable. Most of the accounts receivable will be collected in this step because the sales person s compensation is tied to sales receipts. The Company typically offers is 90 to 120 days credit terms to its customers.

Step 2: If the sales person s collection efforts are not successful, the Company hires a collection agent and allows the agent another three to six months to collect the accounts receivable.

Step 3: If the collection agent s efforts are not successful, the Company will commence legal action to collect the accounts receivable.

Our policies for writing off the accounts receivable are as follows:

1.

If after taking legal action, it appears that an accounts receivable is not likely to become collectible, such accounts receivable will be written off if it is more than two years old.

2.

If during the collection period, the customer provides bankruptcy or other insolvency documentation, the corresponding accounts receivable will be written off.

3.

If we are no longer able to locate a particular customer in order for us to take any collection or legal actions, the accounts receivable for such customer will be written off if it is more than two years old.

Inventory 

We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand, future pricing and market conditions. If actual future demands, future pricing or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required and the differences could be material. Such differences might significantly impact cash flows from operating activities.

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Judgment is required to determine the estimated useful lives of assets, especially for computer equipment, including determining how long existing equipment can function and when new technologies will be introduced at cost-effective price points to replace existing equipment. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the financial position and results of operations.

Table of Contents 

Stock-Based Compensation 

Our stock-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model for share options and Binominal model for warrants and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The BSM model and Binominal model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life. Changes in these assumptions could materially impact the financial position and results of operations.

Valuation of Intangibles 

From time to time, we acquire intangible assets that are beneficial to our product development processes. Management periodically evaluates the carrying value of intangibles, including the related amortization periods. In evaluating acquired intangible assets, management determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the operation and eventual disposition of the product line with its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, the amount of the impairment, if any, will be determined by comparing the carrying value of each intangible asset with its fair value.  Fair value is generally based on either a discounted cash flows analysis or market analysis. Future operating income is based on various assumptions, including regulatory approvals, patents being granted, and the type and nature of competing products. If regulatory approvals or patents are not obtained or are substantially delayed, or other competing technologies are developed and obtain general market acceptance or market conditions otherwise change, our intangibles may have a substantially reduced value, which could be material.

Research and Development 

The remuneration of the Company s research and development staff, materials used in internal research and development activities, and payments made to third parties in connection with collaborative research and development arrangements, are all expensed as incurred.  Where the Company makes a payment to a third party to acquire the right to use a product formula which has received regulatory approval, that payment is accounted for as the acquisition of a license or patent and is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over the shorter of the remaining license period or patent life.

Income Taxes 

We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine the current provision for income taxes and the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Management s judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, management s interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or management s interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the financial statements. Management s assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render management s current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from the estimates, thus materially impact the financial position and results of operations.

Foreign Currency 

Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and our subsidiary and our VIE in China use their respective local currencies as their functional currencies, i.e. the RMB. An entity s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Management must use judgment in determining an entity s functional currency, assessing economic factors including cash flow, sales price, sales market, expense, financing and inter-company transactions and arrangements. The impact from exchange rate changes related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency is recorded as a gain and loss in the statements of operations, while the impact from exchange rate changes related to translating a foreign entity s financial statements from the functional currency to its reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, is disclosed and accumulated in a separate component under the equity section of the balance sheets. Different judgments or assumptions resulting in a change of functional currency may materially impact our financial position and results of operations.

Business Combinations 

Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. Under the acquisition method the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes 100 percent of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, regardless of the percentage owned, at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets acquired, including other identifiable assets, exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed from contingencies must also be recognized at fair value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. Results of operations of an acquired business are included in the statement of earnings from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs, including conversion and restructuring charges, are expensed as incurred.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings.

From time to time, the Company is involved in legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Except as set forth in the updated disclosures below, there were no material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the information set forth herein, whether as a result of new information, changed circumstances or future events or for any other reason.

To the best of the Company s present understanding, on September 1, 2015, Shaanxi Aoxing Biostar Biotech Ltd. was informed by the People s Court of Shaanxi Province (the  Shaanxi Court ) that its properties, consisting of three residential properties valued at $0.54 million (RMB 3.3 million) had been transferred to Mr. Lianhe Wang, an individual (not affiliated with the Company) to settle an outstanding personal loan to Ronghua Wang, the Company s Chairman and CEO, in the amount of approximately RMB 5.7 million (USD$0.9 million). It is the Company s understanding that because the corporate seal of Shaanxi Biostar was affixed to the loan agreement between the foregoing parties (which was done at the request of the lender for the sole purpose of Shaanxi Biostar s acknowledging the transaction that involved its Chief Executive Officer, and not for any guarantee, security and/or undertaking or other similar purpose), the Shaanxi Court deemed Shaanxi Biostar as a co-borrower under this loan arrangement. The foregoing debt was personal debt of Ronghua Wang and no assets of Shaanxi Aoxing Biostar Biotech Ltd. were pledged to secure Ronghua Wang s obligations in connection with such personal loan. Ronghua Wang has not borrowed money from the Company; nor has the Company obtained any proceeds from, guaranteed or secured any of his loans. Subsequently, Shaanxi Biostar was informed by the Shaanxi Court that as a result of Ronghua Wang s inability to service the personal debt in question, Shaanxi Biostar s properties (3 properties totaling 504 sq. meters), valued at RMB 3.3 million (US$0.54 million) had been transferred to Lianhe Wang to satisfy the outstanding debt. Shaanxi Biostar agreed to the foregoing arrangement to avoid further legal costs; Ronghua Wang agreed to compensate the Company for any loss arising from this legal matter, with such compensation to be paid no later than September 2016. The Company understands that with respect to the properties transferred to Wang Lianhe, Wang Lianhe is willing to return the properties to Shaanxi Biostar if Ronghua Wang satisfies and discharges his personal loan obligations. Ronghua Wang has repaid in full the $0.5 million (RMB 3.3 million) to the Company as compensation for the loss of properties and there are no any material effects on the Company s day-to-day operations as a result of the foregoing events.

To the best of the Company s understanding, in May 2015, a bank account of Shaanxi Aoxing Pharmaceutical Company Limited was frozen as a result of actions by Bai Yun, an individual lender (not affiliated with the Company), in his attempt to collect the outstanding balance on the personal loan due to him from Ronghua Wang in the amount of RMB 3 million (USD$0.48 million), which personal loan was in default. The foregoing debt was personal debt of Ronghua Wang dating to 2010, which Ronghua Wang obtained to acquire a real estate parcel; no assets of Shaanxi Aoxing Pharmaceutical Company Limited were pledged to secure Ronghua Wang s obligations in connection with such personal loan. Also, the corporate seal of Shaanxi Biostar was affixed to the loan agreement between the foregoing parties (which was done at the request of the lender for the sole purpose of Shaanxi Biostar s acknowledging the transaction that involved its Chief Executive Officer, and not for any guarantee, security and/or undertaking or other similar purpose). As of June 2014, Wang Ronghua owed Bai Yun RMB 5.17 million (or US$0.8 million representing principal and accrued interest on the original loan. Subsequently, Ronghua Wang commenced a lawsuit against the seller of the real estate in question and, in December 2014, secured a judgment in the amount of RMB 17 million against the seller to recover the purchase price. At approximately the same time, Bai Yun initiated a legal action against Ronghua Wang to collect on the outstanding debt. The parties to the dispute engage in settlement negotiations and on January 9, 2015, the court finalized the settlement arrangement between the parties. Ronghua Wang has been attempting to collect on his judgment against the seller, but so far he has not been successful, which, in turn, resulted in his inability to honor the terms of his settlement arrangement with Bai Yun. In May 2015, Bai Yun sought to foreclose on the Company s land and bank account to satisfy the outstanding debt and in February 2016, the court attempted to force a sale of the Company s 2,674 sq. meter parcel which is currently idle, at an auction. In order to prevent such auction sale, Ronghua Wang paid RMB 2.5 million to Bai Yun in March 2016 which amount was applied to the outstanding debt; following this payment, Bai Yun petitioned the court to terminate the auction sale. The title of the buildings and land use rights subject of this legal matter are currently seized by the court, but have not been transferred to the lender. It is also the Company s understanding that as of June 30, 2016, Ronghua Wang had partially repaid the outstanding balance of the loan, thus avoiding the Company s land use rights and buildings being seized and auctioned with proceeds used to settle this debt. Ronghua Wang is in the process of resolving this matter and settling the outstanding balance on the loan; if he pays off the outstanding balance of the loan to Bai Yun, it is the Company s understanding that the properties and land will be immediately released. As of the date of this report, the matter has not been resolved and the remaining balance owed to Bai Yun remains still outstanding; accordingly, the properties and land remain seized by the courts.

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings. (Cont d)

Following Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff s comments on the Company s disclosures relating to the foregoing matters set forth in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015, the Company provided a full set of responses and supplemental materials for the staff s review and consideration. There is also no assurance that Ronghua Wang will be able to repay his personal debts in full before his creditor(s) take any other further legal action. If the remaining balance is not repaid, the Company s property and assets in question will remain in Ronghua Wang s creditor(s)  possession until the debt is discharged. If and to the extent such properties are not returned to the Company or the Company does not obtain timely and adequate compensation for such transfers, the Company s business and operations may suffer adverse consequences. On October 10, 2016, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff sent a follow up letter to the Company regarding the background and circumstances as well as involvement and actions by the Company s Board of Directors regarding the use of Company assets, and internal controls governing the use of Company stamps and chops related to the legal proceedings described above. The Company provided its responses to the follow-up letter to Nasdaq on October 28, 2016 with details surrounding the legal proceedings as well as the Board involvement, or lack thereof, to the loan agreements entered into by Mr. Ronghua Wang that have resulted in the seizure of certain of the Company assets. There is no assurance that the Nasdaq staff will not continue its inquiry resulting in an action that may have adverse effects on the Company s continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Except as set forth below, there were no material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2015.

There is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash of $659,359 and net working capital of $759,717. For the period ended September 30, 2016, we reported a net loss of $9,086,460 and net cash provided by operating activities of $ 911,057 . We generated cash flow from operations even though we incurred a net loss as we collected outstanding receivables from our trade debtors, and our net loss includes certain non-cash expenses that are added back to our cash flow from operations as shown on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. There is no assurance that the production lines at Aoxing will resume and the renewal of GMP certificates will occur when anticipated, or even if they are renewed, we will be able to return to the production levels as anticipated. Our inability to regain our production levels as anticipated may have material adverse effects on our business, operations and financial performance, and the Company may become insolvent. In addition, as discussed elsewhere in this Report, there is no assurance that Mr. Wang will be able to repay his personal debts in full before his creditors take further legal actions. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current plans for the next twelve months, we anticipate that the sales of the Company s pharmaceutical products in Shaanxi Weinan, after having recently gained renewal of its GMP certificates, will be the primary organic source of funds for future operating activities in 2016. However, no assurance can be given that we will have revenues sufficient to support and sustain our operations or that we would be able to obtain equity financing in the current economic environment. We intend to make substantial efforts to collect outstanding accounts and other receivables to meet its debt obligations; we may also seek bank borrowing, if available, as well as capital raises through public or private offerings. There is no assurance that we will find such funding on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope, or substantially curtail or, under certain dire financial circumstances, cease our operations.  We also anticipate that the new topical health product called  Easy Breathing  will be launched for sale in November 2016. The product was developed by the Company s research and development team over the past 3 years. The product is designed to have effects of relieving stuffy nose, inhibiting nasal bacteria and viruses, and mitigating effects on the inflammation of nasal mucosa. It will be manufactured, distributed and sold in China.  

If we are unable to renew our GMP certificates and subsequently achieve anticipated production levels, our operations may be materially adversely affected.

The Company has experienced a substantial decrease in sales volume of all Aoxing Pharmaceutical Products in the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was due to Aoxing Pharmaceutical s temporarily suspension of production to conduct maintenance of its production lines to renew its GMP certificates which is currently anticipated to be completed at the end of 2016. While our production levels of Shaanxi Weinan products helped to offset the substantial decrease in our sales volume in the most recent fiscal quarter, our sales volume continue to remain at the present decreased levels. However, there is no assurance that the production lines at Aoxing will resume as anticipated and the renewal of GMP certificates will occur when anticipated, or even if they are renewed, we will be able to return to the anticipated production levels. Our inability to regain anticipated production levels may have material adverse effects on our business, operations and financial performance, and may render the Company insolvent.
