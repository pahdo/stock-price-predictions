Financial Statements     NU-MED PLUS, INC.            FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (UNAUDITED)   September 30, 2016       The financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted.  However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been made.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes, and with the historical financial information of the Company.                   2                  Nu-Med Plus, Inc.

The Company's immediate focus is on a nitric oxide powder formulation that is 99% pure-with a one year shelf life, a "hospital" generator device with controls, plus built-in safety monitors, that delivers inhaled nitric oxide to replace expensive pressurized canisters, a compact mobile rechargeable device to deliver inhaled nitric oxide gas and a nitric oxide clinical unit, along with research into the application of nitric oxide in wound healing. The Company is incorporated in Utah.        NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       a. Basis of Interim Financial Statement Presentation       The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted in accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The information furnished in the interim financial statements includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of such financial statements.  Although management believes the disclosures and information presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, it is suggested that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company s most recent audited financial statements and notes thereto included in its December 31, 2015 financial statements.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.       b. Revenue Recognition       The Company is currently developing its products. It is anticipated that revenue will be recognized on product sales once the product has been shipped to the customers, persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.        c. Estimates       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.       d.  Derivative Financial Instruments       In the 4 th  quarter of 2015 the Company issued a note payable which terms require that the transaction be accounted for as a derivative financial instrument.  The Company is accounting for this financial instrument in accordance with ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging , which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability, measured at its fair value as of the reporting date.  ASC 815 also requires that changes in the derivatives  fair value be recognized in earnings.  The Company recorded the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the accompanying balance sheets and income statements.  (See Note 7).        7                          Nu-Med Plus, Inc.     Notes to the Financial Statements     (Unaudited)        e. Fair Value       All cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  Additionally, we measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis.         Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include:       Level 1 - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;       Level 2 - Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and       Level 3 - Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.       Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is observable.       In applying the Black-Scholes option model at September 30, 2016, the Company again revalued the conversion features using the following assumptions:  stock price of $0.40, annualized volatility of 170%, and interest rate of 0.59% and determined that, during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company s derivative liability increased by $8,558 and decreased by $133,874, respectively, to $63,019.  The Company recognized a corresponding gain on derivative liability in conjunction with this revaluation during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016.       Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows at September 30, 2016 and 2015:             The following table shows the classifications of the Company s liability at September 30, 2016 that are subject to fair value measurement and the roll-forward of these liabilities from December 31, 2015:                8                      Nu-Med Plus, Inc.     Notes to the Financial Statements     (Unaudited)              f. Cash and Cash Equivalents       The Company considers all deposit accounts and investment accounts with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.         g. Fixed Assets       Fixed assets are stated at cost.  Expenditure for minor repairs, maintenance, and replacement parts which do not increase the useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures exceeding $500 for new assets, or that increase the useful life of existing assets, are capitalized.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method.  The lives over which the fixed assets are depreciated are five to seven years.       NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)       h. Earnings per Share       The computation of earnings per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period of the financial statement as follows:     
          Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares plus dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. During the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 there were no outstanding common stock equivalents.  Furthermore, due to the net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, common stock equivalents would not be included in the calculation of the net loss per common share, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.                     9                      Nu-Med Plus, Inc.     Notes to the Financial Statements     (Unaudited)        i. Income Taxes       Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.       j. Equity Instruments Issued for Non-Cash Items       In accordance with ASC Topic 718, the Company records equity instruments issued for non-cash items at the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued.        NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN       The Company acknowledges that the funds on hand as of September 30, 2016, will not be sufficient and funding through the sale of equity capital and short term related party and other shareholder loans in order to meet the planned expenditures for development, operations, and administrative cost over the next 12 months will be required. Planned expenditures are approximately $1,160,000 for the next twelve months. The Company is currently funded through November 30, 2016. The Company is actively working to secure the funding needed to execute its business plan.  Until such funding is secured, management will adjust any salaries and expenditures based on the need for successful continuous operations. If plans to obtain further financing prove to be insufficient to fund operations, continued viability could be at risk. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  No adjustments have been made in the financial statements that might result from this uncertainty.        NOTE 4 - FIXED ASSETS       Fixed assets and related accumulated depreciation consisted of the following at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015:         Depreciation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,787 and $1,855, respectively.       Depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $5,361 and $5,429, respectively.            10                      Nu-Med Plus, Inc.     Notes to the Financial Statements     (Unaudited)        NOTE 5 - PREFERRED STOCK       On October 19, 2011, the Company filed Articles of Incorporation with the State of Utah so as to authorize 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock having a par value of $0.001 per share. No preferred shares are issued or outstanding at September 30, 2016.        NOTE 6 - COMMON STOCK       In February 2016, the Company entered into a stock subscription agreement with an investor for them to purchase up to 17,500 shares of common stock at a price of $0.40 per share. In February 2016, the Company received $7,000 for the Stock Subscription Payable.        In March 2016, the Company entered into a stock subscription agreement with an investor for them to purchase up to $100,000 of common stock at a price of $0.40 per share. In March 2016, the Company received $100,000 for the Stock Subscription Payable.        On April 21, 2016, the Company issued 267,500 shares of its restricted common stock in full satisfaction of all obligations under the stock subscription agreements then outstanding.       On June 13, 2016, the directors of the Company entered into an amended consulting agreement and authorized the issuance of 2,500,000 shares of its restricted common stock in payment of those services.  The agreement covers services to be provided through October 2016.  The stock issued has a valuation, based on the closing price of the date of authorization, of $1,000,000.  Of that amount, $773,371 was expensed in recognition of services received and the balance of $226,629 is recorded as a prepaid expense and will be amortized as the future services are rendered.       On July 18, 2016 the Company entered into a stock subscription agreement with an investor for them to purchase up to 157,500 shares of restricted common stock at $0.40 per share.  The agreement has an expiration date of August 1, 2017.  On July 18 and July 27, 2016 the Company received $1,000 and $1,500, respectively, under this agreement.       On August 5, 2016, Dr. Craig Morrison returned to the Company 2,000,000 shares of restricted common stock which is part of the 4,000,000 shares which had been issued to him for his services as a director and medical advisor.  The 2,000,000 shares of stock were retired at their par value of $2,000, reducing the number of shares issued and outstanding.       NOTE 7   DERIVATIVE LIABILITY       The Company adopted ASC 815 which defines determining whether an instrument (or embedded feature) is solely indexed to an entity s own stock. The exercise price of the newly issued and outstanding warrants are subject to  reset  provisions in the event the Company subsequently issues common stock, stock warrants, stock options or convertible debt with a stock price, exercise price or conversion price lower than exercise price of these warrants. If these provisions are triggered, the exercise price of the warrant will be reduced. As a result, the Company has determined that the exercise feature is not considered to be solely indexed to the Company s own stock and is therefore not afforded equity treatment. In accordance with ASC 815, the Company has bifurcated the exercise feature of the warrants and recorded a derivative liability.            11                      Nu-Med Plus, Inc.     Notes to the Financial Statements     (Unaudited)        ASC 815 requires Company management to assess the fair market value of certain derivatives at each reporting period and recognize any change in the fair market value as another income or expense item. The Company s only asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its derivative liability associated with warrants.       At origination, the Company valued the conversion features using the following assumptions:  stock price of $0.50 and annualized volatility of 232%.  The Company determined that at origination the liability related to the debt issued was $102,327, which was $47,327 greater than the transaction value and was expensed at the time of origination.       At December 31, 2015, the Company revalued the conversion features using the following assumptions:  stock price of $0.94 and annualized volatility of 240%, and determined that, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company s derivative liability increased by $94,566 to $196,893.  The Company recognized a corresponding loss on derivative liability in conjunction with this revaluation during the year ended December 31, 2015.       The Company revalued the conversion features at September 30, 2016 using the following assumptions:  stock price of $0.40 and annualized volatility of 170%, and determined that, during the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company s derivative liability increased by $8,558 for the three months and decreased by $133,874 for the nine-month period to $63,019.  The company recognized a corresponding loss of $8,558 on derivative liability in conjunction with this revaluation during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016.       During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 we had the following activity in the accounts related to our convertible notes payable:                  12                      Nu-Med Plus, Inc.     Notes to the Financial Statements     (Unaudited)        NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES        Operating Lease Obligations        The Company leases office space for which it incurred lease payments, on a month-to-month basis, beginning in February of 2012 for $1,000 per month. The Company also had a one-year lease on lab space beginning April 1, 2012 and ending March 31, 2013, with a monthly lease payment of $388. Pursuant to the lease agreement, at the end of one year, the term is month-to-month at the same rate of $388 per month.        NOTE 9   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS        In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02,  L eases.    This ASU requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses in the income statement in a manner similar to current accounting treatment.  This ASU changes the guidance on sale-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs and lease execution costs, and, for lessors, modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases.  For public business entities, this ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein.  Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements and disclosures.       In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .  This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements and disclosures.       The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on its consolidated results of operation, financial position and cash flows.  Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on its current or future earnings or operations.        NOTE 10 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS        Contributed Services        During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company officers contributed services to the Company in the amount of $0 and $409, respectively. The Company officers received no compensation and have no expectation of compensation for these services, either now or in the future, and waive their rights to any such compensation.          Compensation of Officers        Its 2012 the Company agreed to compensate its Chief Executive Officer $3,600 per month. Beginning in January 2013 the Company agreed to compensate its CEO $3,550 per month.        In February 2015, the Company began compensating the Vice President of Technology and the Vice President of Scientific Development $2,000 per month for services provided to the Company.         13                      Nu-Med Plus, Inc.     Notes to the Financial Statements     (Unaudited)        NOTE 11 - LOAN PAYABLE       The Company received, during the year ended December 31, 2013, proceeds from a loan in the amount of $91,600.        The Lender agreed to loan the Company up to $10,000 per month effective September 2012, for up to one year. This loan was memorialized in writing on September 30, 2013. The loan is considered to be a demand note, with a maturity 30 days from the receipt of demand and the holder may not make demand for payment until six months from the date thereof. On June 30, 2014, the Company accrued additional interest on this note, at a rate of 8.0% in the amount of $5,161 for six months. The total loan balance and accrued interest is $130,100 and $13,482 respectively. The note contains a conversion option. The conversion price is one share for each $0.01 of principal and accrued but unpaid interest of the note subject to a beneficial ownership limitation. That limitation prevents the holder from owning more than 4.9% of the number of shares of the common stock outstanding after conversion. If the holder's ownership has not previously been reduced to less than 4.9% of the number of shares outstanding, then the limitation shall be 9.9%. On November 18, 2015, the Company received $55,000 for which it issued a note payable.  As the note carries no rate of interest, in December 2015, 33,800 shares of restricted common stock were issued in consideration.         NOTE 12 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS       The Company has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to ASC Topic 855 and has determined that there are no events that require disclosure as of the date of issuance.        Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations          Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements        Certain statements in this Report constitute  forward-looking statements.   Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, among others, uncertainties relating to general economic and business conditions; industry trends; changes in demand for our products and services; uncertainties relating to customer plans and commitments and the timing of orders received from customers; announcements or changes in our pricing policies or that of our competitors; unanticipated delays in the development, market acceptance or installation of our products and services; changes in government regulations; availability of management and other key personnel; availability, terms and deployment of capital; relationships with third-party equipment suppliers; and worldwide political stability and economic growth. The words  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intend  and  plan  and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made.        Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates           The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and accompanying notes.  Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.              14                     The Company s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the audited financial statements in our recently filed Form 10-K.  As discussed in Note 2, the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual differences could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  The Company believes that the following addresses the Company s most critical accounting policies.       We recognize revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,  Revenue Recognition  ( SAB 104 ).  Under SAB 104, revenue is recognized at the point of passage to the customer of title and risk of loss, when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.        Our policy for our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers  inability to make required payments.  If there is deterioration of our customers  credit worthiness and/or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used, additional allowances may be required.        We account for income taxes in accordance with FASC 740-20,  Accounting for Income Taxes .   Under FASC 740-20, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred tax assets will be reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized.         BUSINESS OVERVIEW        NU-MED PLUS, INC., a Utah corporation ( NU-MED  or the  Company ) was incorporated in October 2011 in the state of Utah as an early stage, emerging growth company, to develop, manufacture and market new technologies in the medical device field.  NU-MED s immediate focus is on the creation of a nitric oxide tablet formulation along with a hospital nitric oxide generator and a mobile rechargeable device to deliver nitric oxide gas. NU-MED is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.          Business        The mission of NU-MED is to design, develop, and market technologies in the medical device field. Our technologies will focus on market niches in high growth trend areas.  We hope each developed technology will fill a current need in medical procedures by improving upon an existing technology or device, or by designing a device to serve a need that is clearly defined and acknowledged by medical professionals.        NU-MED intends to become a medical device company principally engaged in the design, innovation, development, enhancement and commercialization of beginning, early, and selective later-stage quality medical devices. Our immediate focus is on the creation of a nitric oxide tablet formulation, a hospital and clinical inhaled nitric oxide ( NO ) generator and a mobile rechargeable device to deliver nitric oxide gas to offer solutions to hospitals, health systems and the medical community throughout the world.        The core of the product embodiment is the kinetically controlled release of nitric oxide from a chemical reaction. The mechanical means to deliver a metered dose to a patient is of secondary concern and will be addressed once the nitric oxide generation has been optimized. A research laboratory, completed in July 2012, has been equipped with the appropriate safety measures (negative pressure fume hood), nitric oxide analyzer, and standard lab ware to assess chemical reactions that produce nitric oxide. The initial goal is developing a kinetic control and be able to complete testing to optimize the process. Initial efforts are focusing on a proprietary mixture that will show the requisite parameters for generating nitric oxide in a controlled manner.  Once this stage of development is complete, we will         15                     move forward with additional development of the delivery system. The optimization may take an unknown direction that will necessitate changes in the anticipated design of the mechanical delivery apparatus.  Additionally, unforeseen delays, such as obtaining needed chemicals, which we experienced in September and October of 2012, can hamper development timelines.  Management believes it will take some time before a product will be finalized and testing completed.  Until a final product is completed and testing done, no assurance can be given we will be able to complete the product or achieve the costs savings for the patient.       Presently we have filed for four patents for our nitric oxide systems and we hope to file additional patents for our products which will help us build a strong IP portfolio and value for our company and our shareholders.  Our initial preliminary patent applications cover a gas generator (#14/996,685) a controlled delivery of medical gases using diffusion membrane (#14529112), a self-pressuring technique for nitric oxide (62/392,086) and Thermal release of nitric oxide for short term therapies (#62/283,145). Our patent applications are still pending and have not been approved. Our application related to Thermal release of nitric oxide was a provisional patent and we are in the process of filing the definitive patent application.  No assurance can be given that we will be successful in obtaining patent protection and, even if obtained, that there will be any value to the patents. We are also pursuing a proprietary protection strategy of our key formulations and methods for further strengthening the overall intellectual property portfolio. We have no trademarks. We also have no franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts.        The gas generator was developed with the hope it could eventually be used in the delivery of inhaled nitric oxide gas to patients. The basis of the patent for the gas generator s gas delivery system is the kinetically controlled release of gas from a chemical reaction which converts our low cost proprietary powder into a highly purified, therapeutic metered dose. Our system is designed for precision and safety of the delivered quantity over the full range of anticipated doses and applications.  We have also filed a patent for our portable rechargeable inhaled nitric oxide membrane unit and a short term therapy thermal release unit. We have only filed the initial patent applications and there is no assurance any patent will be received from such filing.  Additionally, even if we receive the patent, the gas generator systems would still require extensive study and would be required to receive FDA approval before it could be used, which could take years to receive.        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES        At September 30, 2016, we had assets of $252,882 with current assets of $228,012 and liabilities of $389,490. Our current assets consisted primarily of cash in the amount of $1,383 and prepaid expenses in the amount of $226,629. We currently do not have the cash to pay ongoing expenses and have had to rely on loans from shareholders or sale of our stock to cover expenses.  Without additional capital, we will not be able to stay in business and move our business plan forward.  We anticipate, based on our preliminary budgets, that we will need $200,000 in additional financing for the next twelve months to cover our corporate overhead and need an additional $960,000 to cover ongoing product development. Since we will not have a commercial product in the next twelve months, we will have to rely on outside funding to support our operations and product development and testing efforts.  Given the financial state of NU-MED, we will not be able to seek traditional bank financing and have to rely on private stock sales as well as potential loans from investors and shareholders.  At this time, we have no commitments from any party to help fund our operations and if we are unable to raise additional capital, we will be force to shut operations until such capital can be raised or go out of business.  We cannot estimate the full costs to bring our proposed product to market or the timing of such commercialization.  Given the nature of our product being in the medical field, testing is very expensive and we would need more capital prior to completing the testing phase.  Any refinement or modification of the product after the prototype is developed would also require additional capital.  At this time, we will have to continue to rely on outside capital and a budget that may require adjustment as we move further in the product development phase.        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had no revenues and operating expenses of $695,815 and $939,452, respectively.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had net losses of         16                     $716,807 and $842,893, respectively.  This compares to net losses of $307,378 and $823,228 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Professional and consulting fees were $672,751 and $868,072 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and were predominately composed of legal and audit fees and stock issued to consultants.  Without the cash to pay consultants and with an illiquid market for our shares, we have been forced to pay consultants with shares which may have limited value to the consultant, and as such, the consultants have asked for larger numbers of shares as compensation than would have been required if we had a more active trading market for our shares.  We will be dependent on outside capital to support operations for the foreseeable future and at this time do not have any commitments for additional capital.  We have signed a term sheet with the intent to raise $1,160,000 in capital.  However, there can be no assurance that the proposed offering will be successful.  We do not anticipate any revenue for the foreseeable future as our products are still in the development stage.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.        The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and it is not anticipated that the Company will enter into any off-balance sheet arrangements.        Forward-looking Statements        Our Company and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are  forward-looking,  including statements contained in this Quarterly Report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our Company s stockholders. Management believes that all statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters, as well as from developments beyond our Company s control including changes in global economic conditions are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. These statements are made on the basis of management s views and assumptions, as of the time the statements are made, regarding future events and business performance. There can be no assurance, however, that management s expectations will necessarily come to pass. Factors that may affect forward- looking statements include a wide range of factors that could materially affect future developments and performance, including the following:       Changes in Company-wide strategies, which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which our Company is involved or chooses to invest; changes in U.S., global or regional economic conditions, changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including significant interest rate fluctuations, which may impede our Company s access to, or increase the cost of, external financing for our operations and investments; increased competitive pressures, both domestically and internationally, legal and regulatory developments, such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities, the imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions and changes in international tax laws or currency controls; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, labor disputes, which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations.       This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.          Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.        Not applicable.          Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.          Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures          Our management, with the participation of our CEO and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation,          17                      our CEO and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.              Changes in internal control over financial reporting        There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting.
