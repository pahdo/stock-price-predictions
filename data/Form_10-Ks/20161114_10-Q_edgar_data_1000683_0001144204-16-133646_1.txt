Note 1   Company and Basis of Consolidation   

Blonder Tongue Laboratories,
Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the   Company  ) is a technology-development and manufacturing
company that delivers television signal encoding, transcoding, digital transport, and broadband product solutions to the cable
markets the Company serves, including the multi-dwelling unit market, the lodging/hospitality market and the institutional market
including, hospitals, prisons and schools, primarily throughout the United States and Canada. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The results for the
third quarter of 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year and have not been
audited. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (  GAAP  ) for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation
S-X. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments,
consisting primarily of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation. Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to Securities
and Exchange Commission  ( SEC )  rules and regulations. These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto that were included in the Company s latest annual report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

Note 2   Liquidity and Going Concern  

The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported loss from operations of $379 and $4,386, respectively, and net cash provided
by (used in) operating activities of $763 and $(356), respectively. Although operations have improved, the Company continues to
experience liquidity constraints. In addition, the Company s Revolver and Term Loan (as such terms are defined in Note 6
below) will expire by their terms on December 1, 2016, unless extended. The above factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern. 

In response to lower
than expected sales due to a slowdown in market activities experienced during the prior fiscal year, the Company implemented a
multi-phase cost-reduction program in 2015, which has reduced annualized expenses, including a temporary reduction in certain executive
salaries, a decrease in workforce and a decrease in engineering consulting expenses. 

T he Company s primary
sources of liquidity are its existing cash balances, cash generated from operations and amounts available under the Santander
Financing and the Subordinated Loan Facility (as such terms are defined in Note 7 below). As of September 30, 2016, the Company
had approximately $1,910 outstanding under the Revolver and $810 of additional availability for borrowing under the Revolver.
As indicated in Note 7 below, the Subordinated Loan Facility provides the Company with up to $750 of additional liquidity, of
which $250 remains available for borrowing at September 30, 2016. The Company expects to either obtain an extension on the maturity
date or refinance all or part of the Santander Financing indebtedness prior to December 1, 2016. If anticipated operating results
are not achieved, and/or sufficient funds are not obtained from the Company s expected extension or refinancing of the Santander
Financing, further reductions in operating expenses may be needed and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
ability to achieve its intended business objectives.  

The Company cannot
provide any assurance that it will be able to refinance its current debt obligations. If the Company is unable to refinance, it
may be required to take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve its cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations
and meet its obligations, which measures may be insufficient to enable the Company to continue as a going concern.

Note 3   Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies  

(a)    Use of Estimates  

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

(b)    Derivative Financial Instruments  

The Company evaluates
its convertible instruments to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivative financial
instruments to be separately accounted for in accordance with Topic 815 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  )
Accounting Standards Codification (  ASC  ). The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires
that the Company record the embedded conversion option at its fair value as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair
value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense
for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at
each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as
of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. 

The Black-Scholes Model,
which approximates the Binomial Lattice Model was used to estimate the fair value of the conversion options that is classified
as a derivative liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can
materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of
time equal to the weighted average life of the conversion options. 

Conversion options
are recorded as a discount to the host instrument and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying instrument. 

(c)    Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company measures
fair value of its financial assets on a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies
in measuring fair value: 

Level 1   Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level 2   Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.   

Level 3   Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.   

The fair value hierarchy
also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. 

The derivative liability
is measured at fair value using quoted market prices and estimated volatility factors based on historical quoted market prices
for the Company s common stock, and is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

  (unaudited)  

(d)    Earnings (loss) Per Share  

Earnings (loss) per
share is calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 260  Earnings Per Share,  which provides for the calculation of  basic 
and  diluted  earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing
net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share
reflect, in periods in which they have a dilutive effect, the effect of potential common shares. The diluted earnings (loss) per
share excludes incremental shares related to stock options, restricted stock and convertible debt of 1,875 and 2,183 for the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and 2,028 and 1,799 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. These shares were excluded due to their antidilutive effect. 

Note 4   New Accounting Pronouncements  

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments , seeking to eliminate diversity in practice related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented
and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues and apply
to all entities, including both business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash
flows under FASB  Accounting Standards Codification  (FASB ASC) 230,  Statement of Cash Flows . The amendments in ASU
2016-15 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and
interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim
period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning
of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in
the same period. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.
If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be
applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. 

In March, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update  ASU 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting . This standard is intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affects all organizations
that issue share based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share -based payment award transactions
are simplified, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification
on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated
financial position and results of operations. 

In March 2016 the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-17,  Investment-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying
the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  that affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities
accounted for under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Under the
new guidance, all equity investments in unconsolidated entities (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting)
will generally be measured at fair value through earnings. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification for equity
securities with readily determinable fair values. For financial liabilities when the fair value option has been elected, changes
in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive income. In addition,
the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax. The standard is effective
for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments
should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence
that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption
of this standard will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations. 

In March, 2016, the
FASB issued  ASU 2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments . This
standard clarifies the required steps to be taken when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call/put options
are clearly and closely related to those of their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not
believe the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position and results
of operations. 

In February 2016, FASB
issued  ASU 2016-02 ,  Leases (Topic 842).  FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among
organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing
arrangements. Certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required, as well as a retrospective recognition and measurement
of impacted leases. The new ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15,
2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on
the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations. 

In November 2015,
the FASB issued  ASU 2015-17 ,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation
of deferred taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17
is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. The guidance may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not
believe the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position and results
of operations. 

In July 2015, the FASB
issued  ASU 2015-11 ,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory . ASU 2015-11 simplifies the subsequent measurement of
inventory by requiring inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 applies only to inventories
for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in first-out and the retail inventory method. ASU 2015-11 is effective
for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption of ASU 2015-11 is permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material effect
on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In May 2014, the FASB
issued  ASU 2014-09 ,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition
model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that
reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , which deferred the effective date of
ASU 2014-09 to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016. Subsequently, FASB issued ASUs in 2016 containing implementation guidance related to ASU 2014-09, including:
ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross
versus Net) , which is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal
versus agent considerations; ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing , which is intended to clarify two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing
implementation guidance; and ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and
Practical Expedients , which contains certain provision and practical expedients in response to identified implementation issues.
The Company is planning to adopt ASU 2014-09 and related ASUs on February 1, 2018. Companies may use either a full retrospective
or a modified retrospective approach to adopt these ASUs. The Company is currently evaluating these ASUs, including which transition
approach to use, but does not expect these ASUs to materially impact the Company's consolidated net income, financial position
or cash flows. 

Note 5   Inventories  

Inventories net of reserves are summarized as follows: 

Inventories are stated
at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method, or market. 

The Company periodically
analyzes anticipated product sales based on historical results, current backlog and marketing plans. Based on these analyses, the
Company anticipates that certain products will not be sold during the next twelve months. Inventories that are not anticipated
to be sold in the next twelve months have been classified as non-current.

Approximately 51% and
73% of the non-current inventories were comprised of finished goods at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
The Company has established a program to use interchangeable parts in its various product offerings and to modify certain of its
finished goods to better match customer demands. In addition, the Company has instituted additional marketing programs to dispose
of the slower moving inventories. 

The Company continually
analyzes its slow-moving and excess inventories. Based on historical and projected sales volumes for finished goods, historical
and projected usage of raw materials and anticipated selling prices, the Company establishes reserves. Inventory that is in excess
of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates its estimate of future demand. Products that
are determined to be obsolete are written down to the lower of cost or market value. 

Note 6   Debt  

On August 6, 2008,
the Company entered into a Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with Santander Bank, N.A. (formerly known as Sovereign
Bank, N.A.) (  Santander  ), pursuant to which the Company obtained an $8,000 credit facility from Santander (the
  Santander Financing  ). The Company and Santander entered into a series of amendments to the foregoing Revolving
Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement (as so amended, the   Santander Agreement  ), which, among other things,
adjusted the Santander Financing to $6,946 consisting of (i) a $3,500 asset-based revolving credit facility (  Revolver  )
and (ii) a $3,446 term loan facility (  Term Loan  ), each expiring on December 1, 2016. The amounts which may
be borrowed under the Revolver are based on certain percentages of Eligible Receivables and Eligible Inventory, as such terms are
defined in the Santander Agreement. The obligations of the Company under the Santander Agreement are secured by substantially all
of the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. 

Under the Santander
Agreement, the Revolver currently bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime lending rate announced from time to time
by Santander  ( Prime )  plus 5.00%. The Term Loan currently bears interest at a rate per annum equal to Prime
plus 5.00%. Prime was 3.50% at September 30, 2016. 

On August 25, 2016,
the Company entered into the Sixteenth Amendment to Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with Santander (the   Sixteenth
Amendment  ) to amend the Santander Financing. The Sixteenth Amendment extended the termination date of the Santander
Agreement and the  Additional Availability Period  under the Santander Agreement from September 1, 2016 to December
1, 2016. In addition, the Sixteenth Amendment also amended certain financial terms and certain of the Company s financial
covenants. In particular, (i) the  Revolving Interest Rate  increased from an amount equal to the Index (as defined
in the Loan Agreement) plus 1.75% to an amount equal to the Index plus 5.00%, (ii) the  Term Loan Rate  increased from
an amount equal to the Index plus 1.75% to an amount equal to the Index plus 5.00% and (iii) the maximum revolving advance amount
was been reduced from $4,000 to $3,500. In addition, the amended covenants required the Company to achieve EBITDA of not less than
negative (-) $82 as of September 30, 2016 (calculated on a trailing nine month basis). The Company is currently in compliance with
the financial covenants provided in the Sixteenth Amendment. In connection with the Sixteenth Amendment, the Company paid Santander
an amendment fee of $5 and agreed to pay Santander an additional fee of $15 on November 30, 2016 if the Obligations (as defined
in the Santander Agreement) are not paid in full on or before such date. 

On June 1, 2016, the
Company entered into the Fifteenth Amendment to Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with Santander (the   Fifteenth
Amendment  ) to amend the Santander Financing. The Fifteenth Amendment extended the termination date of the Santander
Agreement and the  Additional Availability Period  under the Santander Agreement from June 1, 2016 to September 1,
2016. In addition, the Fifteenth Amendment amended certain of the Company s financial covenants. In particular, the amended
covenants extended the previous balance sheet leverage ratio compliance threshold of not more than 2.00 to 1.00, and required that
the Company to achieve EBITDA of not less than negative (-) $82 as of June 30, 2016 (calculated on a trailing six month basis).
In addition, the Fifteenth Amendment eliminated the Company s ability to request LIBOR loans under the Santander Agreement.

On March 1, 2016, the
Company entered into the Fourteenth Amendment to Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with Santander (the   Fourteenth
Amendment  ) to amend the Santander Financing. The Fourteenth Amendment extended the termination date of the Santander
Agreement and the  Additional Availability Period  under the Santander Agreement from March 1, 2016 to June 1, 2016.
In addition, the Fourteenth Amendment amended certain of the Company s financial covenants. In particular, the amended covenants
relaxed the previous balance sheet leverage ratio compliance threshold of 1.25:1.00, and required that the Company maintain a balance
sheet leverage ratio of not more than (i) 1.85 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2015 and (ii) 2.00 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2016. In addition,
the amended covenants relaxed the previous EBITDA compliance threshold and required that the Company achieve EBITDA thresholds
of not less than (i) negative (-) $3,897 as of December 31, 2015 (calculated on a trailing twelve month basis) and (ii) $50 as
of March 31, 2016 (calculated on a trailing three month basis). The Fourteenth Amendment also required that the Subordinated Lenders
provide the Company with advances under the Subordinated Loan Facility in an aggregate amount (taking into account all prior advances)
of $500, not later than March 31, 2016. 

On February 1, 2016,
the Company entered into the Thirteenth Amendment to Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with Santander (the   Thirteenth
Amendment  ) to amend the Santander Financing. The Thirteenth Amendment extended the termination date of the Santander

Amendment  ) to amend certain terms of the Santander Agreement to facilitate the Company s ability to obtain additional
capital through the issuance of equity or subordinated debt securities or the entry into subordinated loan arrangements following
the date of the Twelfth Amendment. In particular, the Twelfth Amendment modified terms of the Santander Agreement that had restricted
the incurrence of indebtedness and the creation of liens, to allow the Company to incur indebtedness that is subordinate to the
indebtedness under the Santander Agreement and to permit that indebtedness to be secured, provided that any security would also
be subordinate to the obligations and liens under the Santander Agreement. In addition, the Twelfth Amendment modified the restrictions
on the Company s ability to enter into transactions with its affiliates to permit the issuance of equity or subordinated
debt securities to one or more affiliates or the entry into subordinated loan arrangements with one or more affiliates. The Twelfth
Amendment also excluded the proceeds of any permitted equity or debt financing from the collateral subject to Santander s
lien under the Santander Agreement, until such time as and to the extent, such proceeds were utilized for the Company s working
capital or other general corporate purposes. 

On November 14, 2015,

30, 2015, and (ii) increased the advance rate applicable to Eligible Inventory (as defined in the Santander Agreement) from 25%
to 35% through and until February 1, 2016, after which it was to revert back to 25%. The Eleventh Amendment also contained other
customary representations, covenants, terms and conditions. In connection with the Eleventh Amendment, the Company paid Santander
an amendment fee of $50. 

On October 14, 2015,
the Company entered into the Tenth Amendment to Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with Santander (the   Tenth
Amendment  ) to amend the Santander Financing. The Tenth Amendment extended the increase in the advance rate applicable

it was to revert back to 25%. The Tenth Amendment also contained other customary representations, covenants, terms and conditions.
In connection with the Tenth Amendment, the Company paid Santander an amendment fee of $5. 

On August 12, 2015,
the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment to Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with Santander (the   Ninth
Amendment  ) to amend the Santander Financing. The Ninth Amendment waived the Company s failure of compliance with

On May 14, 2015, the
Company entered into the Eighth Amendment to Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with Santander (the   Eighth
Amendment  ) to amend the Santander Financing. The Eighth Amendment (i) waived the Company s failure of compliance
with the Minimum EBITDA covenant for the three-month period ended March 31, 2015, effective as of March 31, 2015, and (ii) increased
the advance rate applicable to Eligible Inventory (as defined in the Santander Agreement) from 25% to 35% through and until September
30, 2015, after which it was to revert back to 25%. The Eighth Amendment also contained other customary representations, covenants,
terms and conditions. In connection with the Eighth Amendment, the Company paid Santander an amendment fee of $15. The Eighth Amendment
was in lieu of the Temporary Overadvance Facility, as more fully discussed in the next paragraph. 

On March 30, 2015, Santander agreed to provide
the Company with $500 of additional availability beyond its borrowing base under the Revolver (the   Temporary Overadvance
Facility  ) during the period April 1, 2015 through April 24, 2015, for which the Company paid Santander an accommodation
fee of $2.5. Under the agreement, the Company was required to eliminate the outstanding balance under the Temporary Overadvance
Facility on or before September 30, 2015, which was accomplished prior to entering into the Eighth Amendment. 

On January 21, 2015,
the Company entered into the Seventh Amendment to Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with Santander (the   Seventh
Amendment  ) to amend the Santander Financing. The Seventh Amendment (i) extended by one year the Termination Date of
the Santander Agreement from February 1, 2015 to February 1, 2016; (ii) continued the installment payments of principal under the
Term Loan at the same monthly payment of $18 per month for the additional year until the final payment of unpaid principal and
interest is due on February 1, 2016; (iii) increased the interest rates applicable to the Revolver and the Term Loan by one quarter
of one percent (0.25%); and (iv) reset and modified the Minimum EBITDA covenant to address the term being extended by one year.
The Seventh Amendment also contained other customary representations, covenants, terms and conditions. The Company paid a $15 amendment
fee to Santander in connection with the Seventh Amendment. 

Upon expiration of
the Revolver, all outstanding borrowings under the Revolver are due. The outstanding principal balance of the Revolver was $1,910
at September 30, 2016. The Term Loan requires equal monthly principal payments of approximately $18 each, plus interest, with the
remaining balance due at maturity. The outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan was $3,428 at September 30, 2016. 

The Santander Agreement
contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial covenants.
The Santander Agreement contains customary events of default, including, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or other
amounts when due. 

Note 7   Subordinated Convertible Debt with Related
Parties  

On March 28, 2016 the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, R.L. Drake Holdings, LLC (  RLD  ), as borrowers and Robert J. Pall ,
as agent (in such capacity   Agent  ) and as a lender, together with Carol M. Pall , Steven Shea and James
H. Williams as lenders (collectively, the   Subordinated Lenders  ) entered into a certain Amended and Restated
Senior Subordinated Convertible Loan and Security Agreement (the   Subordinated Loan Agreement  ), pursuant to
which the Subordinated Lenders agreed to provide the Company with a delayed draw term loan facility of up to $750 (  Subordinated
Loan Facility  ), under which individual advances in amounts not less than $50 may be drawn by the Company. Interest on
the outstanding balance under the Subordinated Loan Facility from time to time, accrues at 12% per annum (subject to increase under
certain circumstances) and is payable monthly in-kind by the automatic increase of the principal amount of the loan on each monthly
interest payment date, by the amount of the accrued interest payable at that time (  PIK Interest  ); provided,
however, that at the option of the Company, it may pay interest in cash on any interest payment date, in lieu of PIK Interest.
The Subordinated Lenders have the option of converting the principal balance of the loan, in whole (unless otherwise agreed by
the Company), into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of $0.54 per share (subject to adjustment under
certain circumstances). This conversion right was subject to stockholder approval as required by the rules of the NYSE MKT, which
approval was obtained on May 24, 2016 at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders. The obligations of the Company and
RLD under the Subordinated Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company s and RLD s assets, including
by a mortgage against the Old Bridge Property (the   Subordinated Mortgage  ). The Subordinated Loan Agreement
terminates three years from the date of closing, at which time the accreted principal balance of the loan (by virtue of the PIK
Interest) plus any other accrued unpaid interest, will be due and payable in full. 

In connection with
the Subordinated Loan Agreement, the Company, RLD, the Subordinated Lenders and Santander entered into an Amended and Restated
Subordination Agreement (the   Subordination Agreement  ), pursuant to which the rights of the Subordinated Lenders
under the Subordinated Loan Agreement and the Subordinated Mortgage are subordinate to the rights of Santander under the Santander
Loan Agreement and related security documents. The Subordination Agreement precludes the Company from making cash payments of interest
in lieu of PIK Interest, in the absence of the prior written consent of Santander.

  (unaudited)  

As of September 30,
2016, the Subordinated Lenders have advanced $500 to the Company. In addition, $16 and $37 of PIK interest has been accrued in
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The Company evaluated the conversion option embedded in the Subordinated Loan Agreement issued in September 2016 in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives and Hedging ,
and determined that the conversion option has all of the characteristics of a derivative in its entirety and does not qualify for
an exception to the derivative accounting rules. Specifically, the exercise price of the conversion option entitles the Subordinated
Lenders to an adjustment of the exercise price in the event that the Company subsequently issues equity securities or equity linked
securities at prices more favorable than the exercise price of the conversion option embedded in the Subordinated Loan Agreement.
Accordingly, the conversion option is not indexed to the Company s own stock. Due to the derivative treatment of the conversion
option, the Company recorded $371 derivative liability at September 30, 2016. The Company computed the fair value of the derivative
liability at the date of issuance and the reporting date using Black-Scholes, which approximates a binomial lattice model with
the following assumptions: stock price of $0.61 and $0.38, conversion price of $0.54 and $0.54, volatility of 102% and 91%, expected
term of 2.5 years and 3 years, risk free rate of 0.83% and 0.87% and dividend yield 0% and 0% at September 30, 2016 and March 31,
2016, respectively. The change in the fair value of the derivative liability and accretion of the debt discount was $122 and $194
in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Subordinated Loan
Agreement amended and restated a prior agreement entered into on February 11, 2016 between the Company and RLD, as borrowers and
Robert J. Pall  and Carol M. Pall , as lenders (the   Prior  S ubordinated Loan Agreement  ),
pursuant to which Mr. and Mrs. Pall  had agreed to provide the Company with a delayed draw term loan facility of up to $600
on terms substantially similar to those terms set forth in the Subordinated Loan Agreement, including the conversion rights and
pledge of Company assets to secure the loan. Aggregate advances under the Prior Subordinated Loan Agreement were $300 and such
balances have transferred over to and now constitute outstanding balances under the Subordinated Loan Agreement. The Prior Subordinated
Loan Agreement was amended and restated by the Subordinated Loan Agreement in order to increase the amount available for borrowing
by the Company in an effort to further enhance the Company s capital resources and liquidity.

Condition and Results of Operations). 

General  

The Company was incorporated
in November, 1988, under the laws of Delaware as GPS Acquisition Corp. for the purpose of acquiring the business of Blonder-Tongue
Laboratories, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, which was founded in 1950 by Ben H. Tongue and Isaac S. Blonder to design, manufacture
and supply a line of electronics and systems equipment principally for the private cable industry. Following the acquisition, the
Company changed its name to Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc. The Company completed the initial public offering of its shares of
Common Stock in December, 1995. 

Today, the Company
is a technology-development and manufacturing company that delivers a wide range of products and services to the cable entertainment
and media industry. For 65 years, Blonder Tongue/Drake products have been deployed in a long list of locations, including lodging/hospitality,
multi-dwelling units/apartments, broadcast studios/networks, education universities/schools, healthcare hospitals/fitness centers,
government facilities/offices, prisons, airports, sports stadiums/arenas, entertainment venues/casinos, retail stores, and small-medium
businesses. These applications are variously described as commercial, institutional and/or enterprise environments. The customers
we serve include business entities installing private video and data networks in these environments, whether they are the largest
cable television operators, telco or satellite providers, integrators, architects, engineers or the next generation of Internet
Protocol Television (  IPTV  ) streaming video providers. The technology requirements of these markets change
rapidly and the Company s research and development team is continually delivering high performance-lower cost solutions to
meet customers  needs. 

The Company s
strategy is focused on providing a wide range of products to meet the needs of the commercial, institutional and/or enterprise
environments described above, and to provide offerings that are optimized for an operator s existing infrastructure, as well
as the operator s future strategy. A key component of this growth strategy is to provide products that deliver the latest
technologies (such as IPTV and digital SD and HD video content) and have a high performance-to-cost ratio. 

The Company has seen
a continuing long-term shift in product mix from analog products to digital products and expects this shift to continue. Sales
of digital video headend products were $2,763,000 and $2,610,000 in the third three months of 2016 and 2015, respectively and $8,889,000
and $7,115,000 in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales of analog video headend products were $559,000 and
$930,000 in the third three months of 2016 and 2015, respectively and $1,789,000 and $2,843,000 in the first nine months of 2016
and 2015, respectively. Any substantial decrease in sales of analog products without a related increase in digital products could
have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

-  13  - 

The Company s
manufacturing is allocated primarily between its facility in Old Bridge, New Jersey the (  Old Bridge Facility  )
and a key contract manufacturer located in the People s Republic of China (  PRC  ). The Company currently
manufactures most of its digital products, including the latest encoder and EdgeQAM collections at the Old Bridge Facility. Since
2007 the Company has transitioned and continues to manufacture certain high volume, labor intensive products, including many of
the Company s analog products, in the PRC, pursuant to a manufacturing agreement that governs the production of products
that may from time to time be the subject of purchase orders submitted by (and in the discretion of) the Company. The Company may
transition additional products to the PRC if determined by the Company to be advantageous based upon changing business and market
conditions. Manufacturing products both at the Company s Old Bridge Facility as well as in the PRC, enables the Company to
realize cost reductions while maintaining a competitive position and time-to-market advantage. 

Results of Operations  

Third three months of 2016 Compared with third three months
of 2015  

Net Sales.  Net
sales decreased $272,000 or 4.8% to $5,432,000 in the third three months of 2016 from $5,704,000 in the third three months of 2015.
The decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease in analog video headend products partially offset by an increase in sales of
digital video headend products. Sales of analog video headend products were $559,000 and $930,000 and digital video headend products
were $2,763,000 and $2,610,000 in the third three months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Cost of Goods Sold.
  Cost of goods sold decreased to $3,531,000 for the third three months of 2016 from $4,931,000 for the third three months of
2015, and decreased as a percentage of sales to 65.0% from 86.5%. The overall decrease as well as the decrease as a percentage
of sales was primarily attributed to an overall reduction in manufacturing overhead, a reduced provision for inventory reserves,
as well as a more favorable product mix. 

Selling Expenses. 
Selling expenses decreased to $645,000 for the third three months of 2016 from $776,000 in the third three months of 2015, and
decreased as percentage of sales to 11.9% for the third three months of 2016 from 13.6% for the third three months of 2015. The
$131,000 decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in salary expense (including fringe benefits) of $104,000 due to a decrease
in headcount. 

General and Administrative
Expenses.  General and administrative expenses decreased to $959,000 for the third three months of 2016 from $1,003,000 for
the third three months of 2015 but increased as a percentage of sales to 17.7% for the third three months of 2016 from 17.6% for
the third three months of 2015. The $44,000 decrease was primarily the result of by a decrease in salary expense (including fringe
benefits) of $53,000 due to a decrease in headcount and decreased professional fees of $50,000 offset by an increase of $58,000
of expenses related to warehouse and factory renovation. 

Research and Development
Expenses.  Research and development expenses decreased to $711,000 in the third three months of 2016 from $869,000 in the third
three months of 2015 and decreased as a percentage of sales to 13.1% for the third three months of 2016 from 15.2% for the third
three months of 2015. This $158,000 decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in amortization expense of $102,000 relating
to license fees and a decrease in salary expense (including fringe benefits) of $55,000 due to a decrease in headcount. 

Operating Loss. 
Operating loss of $414,000 for the third three months of 2016 represents a decrease from the operating loss of $1,875,000 for the
third three months of 2015. Operating loss as a percentage of sales was (7.6%) in the third three months of 2016 compared to (32.9%)
in the third three months of 2015. 

Other Expense. 
Interest expense increased to $107,000 in the third three months of 2016 from $79,000 in the third three months of 2015. The increase
is the result of higher interest rates. 

First nine months of 2016 Compared with first nine months
of 2015  

Net Sales.  Net
sales increased $1,328,000, or 8.4% to $17,057,000 in the first nine months of 2016 from $15,729,000 in the first nine months of
2015. The increase is primarily attributed to an increase in sales of digital video headend products and data products offset by
a decrease in analog video headend products and contract manufactured products. Sales of digital video headend products were $8,889,000
and $7,115,000, data products were $1,592,000 and $499,000, analog video headend products were $1,789,000 and $2,843,000 and contract
manufactured products were $994,000 and $1,144,000 in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Cost of Goods Sold.
  Cost of goods sold decreased to $10,471,000 for the first nine months of 2016 from $12,040,000 for the first nine months
of 2015 and decreased as a percentage of sales to 61.4% from 76.6%. The overall decrease as well as the decrease as a percentage
of sales was primarily attributed to an overall reduction in manufacturing overhead, a reduced provision for inventory reserves,
as well as a more favorable product mix. 

Selling Expenses. 
Selling expenses decreased to $1,961,000 for the first nine months of 2016 from $2,392,000 in the first nine months of 2015 and
decreased as percentage of sales to 11.5% for the first nine months of 2016 from 15.2% for the first nine months of 2015. The $431,000
decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in salary expense (including fringe benefits) of $447,000 due to a decrease in
headcount. 

General and Administrative
Expenses.  General and administrative expenses decreased to $2,906,000 for the first nine months of 2016 from $3,085,000 for
the first nine months of 2015 and decreased as a percentage of sales to 17.0% for the first nine months of 2016 from 19.6% for
the first nine months of 2015. The $179,000 decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in salary expense (including fringe
benefits) of $434,000 due to a decrease in headcount offset by an increased travel and entertainment expense of $103,000 due to
increased business travel in the first quarter and an increase of $67,000 of expenses related to warehouse and factory renovation.
The percentage decrease was primarily the result of higher sales. 

Research and Development
Expenses.  Research and development expenses decreased to $2,098,000 in the first nine months of 2016 from $2,598,000 in the
first nine months of 2015 and decreased as a percentage of sales to 12.3% for the first nine months of 2016 from 16.5% for the

to license fees, a decrease in salary expense (including fringe benefits) of $167,000 due to a decrease in headcount and a decrease
in consulting fees of $78,000.

first nine months of 2015. Operating loss as a percentage of sales was (2.2%) in the first nine months of 2016 compared to (27.9%)
in the first nine months of 2015. 

Other Expense. 
Interest expense increased to $281,000 in the first nine months of 2016 from $228,000 in the first nine months of 2015. The increase
is the result of higher interest rates. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s working capital surplus (deficit) was $574,000 and $(309,000), respectively. The
increase in working capital is primarily due to an increase of cash of $204,000, a decrease in the line of credit of $754,000 and
a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $678,000, offset by a decrease in inventory of $396,000 and an increase
in the derivative liability of $371,000. 

The Company s
net cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $763,000, primarily due to non-cash
adjustments of $1,326,000 and a decrease in inventories of $877,000, offset by a net loss of $857,000 and a decrease in accounts
payable and accrued expenses of $678,000. 

Cash used in investing
activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $86,000, of which $19,000 was attributable to acquisition of
license fees and $67,000 was attributable to capital expenditures. 

Cash used in financing
activities was $473,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, comprised of net repayments on the Revolver of $754,000
and repayment of debt of $119,000, offset by borrowing from related parties of $400,000.

of the Company s senior secured indebtedness under the Santander Facility and the Company s senior subordinated convertible
indebtedness under the Subordinated Loan Facility, and their respective effects upon the Company s condensed consolidated
financial position and results of operations, see Note 6   Debt and Note 7   Subordinated Convertible Debt with Related
Parties, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company s
primary sources of liquidity are its existing cash balances, cash generated from operations and amounts available under the Santander
Financing and the Subordinated Loan Facility. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $1,910,000 outstanding under
the Revolver and approximately $810,000 of additional availability for borrowing under the Revolver, as well as $250,000 of additional
availability for borrowing under the Subordinated Loan Facility. As of October 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $1,728,000
outstanding under the Revolver and approximately $1,146,000 of additional availability for borrowing under the Revolver, as well
as $250,000 of additional availability for borrowing under the Subordinated Loan Facility.

The Company s
Revolver and Term Loan under the Santander Financing, which was to have expired on February 1, 2016, has been extended by Santander
through December 1, 2016. While the Company anticipates either obtaining a further extension of the maturity date of the Santander
Financing or refinancing all or part of the Santander Financing prior to December 1, 2016, there can be no assurances that an extension
or refinancing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment
obligations and additional covenants and operating restrictions. 

Beginning in early
2015, the Company experienced a significant decline in its net sales, which have not recovered to historical norms, but which have
stabilized at reduced levels. Although sales increased in the first nine months of 2016, the Company does not anticipate that sales
will recover to historical norms during 2016. In light of these developments and as detailed below, the Company has taken dramatic
steps during the past year, implemented in several phases, in order to manage operations through what has been and is anticipated
to be a protracted period of diminished sales levels. Based upon these facts and trends occurring in our business, together with
our current expectations for the next four fiscal quarters, we believe that if we are unable to further extend our current Revolver
and Term Loan or otherwise refinance this indebtedness, we will not have sufficient liquidity necessary to sustain operations for
the next twelve months. These factors, and possibly others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern, a risk that was first discussed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed in November 2015. 

During the past eighteen
months, the Company has focused on implementing a turnaround strategy, under which, since March 2015, it has been implementing
operational and financial processes to improve liquidity, cash flow and profitability. In addition to seeking to further extend
or refinance its outstanding indebtedness with Santander that is due on December 1, 2016, the Company has also entered into the
Subordinated Loan Facility, which has provided the Company with $500,000 of additional working capital and under which there remains
availability for further borrowings of an additional $250,000. The Company is currently in discussions with Santander to extend
the term of the Company s Revolver and Term Loan and is in early stage discussions with several alternative lenders regarding
refinancing of the Santander Financing. As of the date of this Report, however, uncertainty exists as to the ultimate outcome of
a refinancing or extension of the Company s Revolver and Term Loan and any commitment or proposal. Accordingly, there are
no assurances that these commitments, proposals or discussions will result in any transaction, or that any such transaction, if
implemented, will be successful. 

In other efforts to
alleviate the liquidity pressures and reposition the Company to generate positive cash flow at a lower level of net sales, since
March 2015, the Company has implemented a multi-phase cost-reduction program which reduced expenses during 2015 by approximately
$1,035,000 and is expected to reduce annualized expenses by approximately $2,850,000. During 2016, the Company has been implementing
additional elements of its cost reduction program designed to preserve working capital, including the further reduction of salaries
of certain employees of the Company. Although we believe we have made and will continue to make progress under these programs (e.g.,
the Company s liquidity has modestly improved since March 30, 2015, and the Company is on track to meet or exceed its cost
reduction target for 2016), we operate in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing
or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our planned operational
improvements will be successful. If anticipated operating results are not achieved, and/or sufficient funds are not obtained from
the Company s efforts to refinance and raise capital, further reductions in operating expenses may be needed and could have
a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives and continue as a going concern. 

The Company s
primary long-term obligations are for payment of interest and principal on the Company s Revolver and Term Loan, both of
which expire on December 1, 2016. The Company expects to use cash generated from operations to meet its long-term debt obligations,
and anticipates obtaining a further extension or refinancing its long-term debt obligations at maturity. The Company considers
opportunities to refinance its existing indebtedness based on market conditions. Although the Company will be required to refinance
all or part of its existing indebtedness by December 1, 2016 (unless a further extension from Santander is obtained), there can
be no assurances that it will successfully do so. Changes in the Company s operating plans, lower than anticipated sales,
increased expenses, or other events, may require the Company to seek additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance
that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment
obligations and additional covenants and operating restrictions. The Company also expects to make financed and unfinanced long-term
capital expenditures from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which capital expenditures were $67,000 and $188,000
in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company expects to use cash
generated from operations, amounts available under its credit facility, proceeds from advances under the Subordinated Loan Facility,
and purchase-money financing to meet any anticipated long-term capital expenditures.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

The Company maintains
a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
in the Company s reports filed or submitted pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the   Exchange
Act  ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The
Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at September 30,
2016. 

During the quarter
ended September 30, 2016, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
