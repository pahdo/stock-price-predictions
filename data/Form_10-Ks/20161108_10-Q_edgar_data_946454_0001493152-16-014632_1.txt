1.
Nature of Operations   

Ballantyne
Strong, Inc. ( Ballantyne  or the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company with diverse
business activities focused on serving the cinema, retail, financial, and government markets. The Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries Strong Westrex, Inc. ( SWI ), Strong Technical Services, Inc., Strong/MDI Screen Systems, Inc., Strong
Westrex (Beijing) Technology Inc. ( SWBTI ), Convergent Corporation and Convergent Media Systems Corporation ( Convergent )
design, integrate, and install technology solutions for a broad range of applications; develop and deliver out-of-home messaging,
advertising and communications; manufacture projection screens; and provide managed services including monitoring of networked
equipment to our customers.  

The
Company s products are distributed to the cinema, retail, financial, and government markets throughout the world.  

2.
Discontinued Operations   

On
June 21, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved a plan under which the Company will pursue a sale of the operations
conducted by its subsidiaries SWBTI and SWI (the  China Operations ) which has historically been included in the Cinema
segment. We expect to complete the sale within the next twelve months. The purpose of the plan is to focus the efforts of the
Company on the business units that have opportunities for higher return on invested capital. As part of this plan, the Company
incurred charges of $0.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 and zero in the third quarter of 2016, which are included in loss
from discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. We reflected the results of the China Operations
as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the China Operations have been reclassified
as assets and liabilities held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.  

On
November 4, 2016, the Company sold SWBTI to GABO Filter, Inc. for total proceeds of $0.4 million. As part of this sale
the Company expects to record a loss on discontinued operations of approximately $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The
final loss from discontinued operations related to this sale may differ from this estimate depending on the actual proceeds received
and the actual disposition costs incurred. In addition, the Company expects to incur charges of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter
related to severance for discontinued operations in conjunction with the sale of SWBTI.  

The
summary comparative financial results of discontinued operations were as follows (in thousands):  

The
assets and liabilities classified as held for sale reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in
thousands):  

3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation    

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all majority owned and controlled domestic
and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

The
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report are presented in accordance with the requirements of Form
10-Q and consequently do not include all of the disclosures normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America for annual reporting purposes or those made in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. These
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2015.  

The
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the Company s audited consolidated balance
sheet as of that date. All other condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein are unaudited and, in the opinion
of management, reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary to present a fair statement of the financial position
and the results of operations and cash flows for the respective interim periods. The results for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of trends or results expected for a full year.  

Use
of Management Estimates    

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S.
GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results and changes in facts and circumstances may alter
such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods.  

Marketable
Securities    

The
Company s marketable securities are comprised of investments in the common stock of a publicly traded company. Changes in
fair value, based on the market price of the investee s stock are recognized in other income in the consolidated statement
of operations. The Company uses the fair value option to account for the investment to more appropriately recognize the value
of this investment in our consolidated financial statements since the Company does not exert significant influence over the investment,
in which case the equity method of accounting has been applied. Marketable securities at fair value were as follows:  

Equity
Method Investments    

In
December 2015, the Company acquired 7.8% ownership in RELM Wireless Corporation ( RELM ) for $4.0 million and increased
its ownership to 8.3% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 for an additional $0.3 million. RELM is a publicly traded
company that designs, manufactures and markets two-way land mobile radios, repeaters, base stations, and related components and
subsystems. The Company s Chief Executive Officer is a member of the board of directors of RELM, and controls entities that,
when combined with the Company s ownership in RELM, own greater than 20% of RELM, providing the Company with significant
influence over RELM, but not controlling interest. As a result of this significant influence, the Company accounts for its investment
in RELM under the equity method. The Company s carrying value for RELM was $4.3 million as of September 30, 2016 and the
Company s equity method investment income of RELM was $0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Based
on quoted market prices, the market value of the Company s ownership in RELM was $6.1 million at September 30, 2016.  

In
May 2016, the Company acquired 31.2% ownership in Itasca Capital Ltd. ( Itasca ) for $3.5 million and increased its
ownership to 32.3% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 for an additional $0.2 million. Itasca is a publicly traded
Canadian company that is an investment vehicle seeking transformative strategic investments. The Company s Chief Executive
Officer is a member of the board of directors of Itasca. This board seat, combined with the Company s 32.3% ownership of
Itasca, provide the Company with significant influence over Itasca, but not controlling interest. As a result of this significant
influence, the Company accounts for its investment in Itasca under the equity method. The Company s carrying value for Itasca
was $3.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and the Company s equity method investment loss in Itasca was $0.1 million during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Based on quoted market prices, the market value of the Company s ownership in
Itasca was $4.4 million at September 30, 2016.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:  

Level
    1 - inputs to the valuation techniques are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   

Level
    2 - inputs to the valuation techniques are other than quoted prices but are observable for the assets or liabilities, either
    directly or indirectly   

Level
    3 - inputs to the valuation techniques are unobservable for the assets or liabilities   

The
following tables present the Company s financial assets measured at fair value based upon the level within the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall.  

Fair
Values Measured on a Recurring Basis at September 30, 2016:  

Fair
values measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2015:  

Quantitative
information about the Company s level 3 fair value measurements at September 30, 2016 is set forth below:  

The
notes receivable are recorded at estimated fair value at September 30, 2016.  

The
significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s note receivable are discount rate and
probability of default. Significant increases (decreases) in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly
lower (higher) fair value measurement.  

The
following table reconciles the beginning and ending balance of the Company s notes receivable fair value:  

The
carrying values of all other financial assets and liabilities including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
reported in the consolidated balance sheets equal or approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
All non-financial assets that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis,
which includes non-financial long-lived assets, are measured at fair value in certain circumstances (for example, when there is
evidence of impairment). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any significant non-recurring
measurements of non-financial assets or liabilities.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 requires
an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The guidance
is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. An entity may adopt this ASU either retrospectively or through a cumulative
effect adjustment as of the start of the first period for which it applies the ASU. Early adoption is not permitted. While the
Company has not yet completed its analysis of ASU 2014-09, the Company anticipates a more significant impact on its Digital Media
segment, primarily due to the nature of that segment s contracts with customers. The Company is currently evaluating adoption
methods and the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements. The Company anticipates that the adoption
may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU
2015-11 ). ASU 2015-11 requires an entity utilizing the first in-first out inventory method to change their measurement
principle for inventory changes from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. The guidance is effective
for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. An entity must adopt this ASU prospectively and early adoption is permitted. The adoption
of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ). ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments that do not result in consolidation
and are not accounted under the equity method to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income;
simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative
assessment to identify impairment; requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total
change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected
to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; requires separate presentation
of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets on the balance sheet or the
accompanying notes to the financial statements; clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on
a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets
and modifies certain fair value disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-01 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is not permitted. The adoption
of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 requires
lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-to-use asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater
than twelve months, on its balance sheet. This ASU is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early
adoption permitted, and requires a modified retrospective transition method. The Company has not yet completed its analysis of
ASU 2016-02 and is evaluating the impact and timing of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements. The Company
anticipates that the adoption may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,  Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting,  ( ASU
2016-07 ). ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement for the Company to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase
in ownership interests (or degree of influence) in an investee triggers equity method accounting. This ASU is effective for the
Company on January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted ASU 2016-07 and there was no impact on its consolidated
financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  ( ASU 2016-09 ).
ASU 2016-09 simplifies accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized
as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for the Company on January
1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. While the Company has not yet completed its analysis, the adoption of ASU 2016-09 is not
expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share   

Basic
earnings (loss) per share has been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Diluted loss per share has been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding after
giving effect to potential common shares from dilutive stock options and certain non-vested shares of restricted stock. The following
table provides the reconciliation between average shares used to compute both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share:  

For
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, grants and options to purchase 350,000 and 363,700 shares of common
stock respectively were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as the option s
exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares for the respective periods. For the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016, options and restricted stock units of 65,937 and 85,618, respectively, were excluded as
their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, thereby decreasing the net loss per share. For the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2015, options to purchase 20,625 and 124,125 shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding but were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as the option s exercise price was greater than the average market
price of the common shares for the respective periods. For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, options
and restricted stock units of 56,873 and 88,877, respectively, were excluded as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, thereby
decreasing the net loss per share.  

5.
Warranty Reserves   

In
most instances, the Company s digital products are covered by the original equipment manufacturing firm s warranty;
however, there are certain customers where the Company may grant warranties in excess of the manufacturer s warranty for
digital products which can be for up to three years. The Company accrues for these costs at the time of sale. The following table
summarizes warranty activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Restructuring Activities   

In
connection with its strategic planning process, as well as the Company s ongoing plans to improve efficiency and effectiveness
of its operations, the Company initiated plans in the second quarter of 2015 to reduce headcount and more efficiently utilize
real estate assets. These plans were completed in the first quarter of 2016 and no expense was recorded in 2016.  

In
connection with the integration of the 2013 Convergent acquisition, as well as the Company s ongoing plans to improve efficiency
and effectiveness of its operations, the Company initiated plans in the fourth quarter of 2013 to reduce headcount and move the
Company s warehouse from Omaha, Nebraska to Georgia. The restructuring initiative was completed in the first quarter of
2015.

Income Taxes   

In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences, projected
future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A cumulative loss in a particular tax jurisdiction
in recent years is a significant piece of evidence with respect to the realizability that is difficult to overcome. Based on the
available objective evidence including recent updates to the taxing jurisdictions generating income, the Company concluded that
a valuation allowance of $8.3 million should be recorded against the Company s U.S. tax jurisdiction deferred tax assets
as of September 30, 2016. During the third quarter the valuation allowance decreased $0.4 million.  

The
Company has completed the examination for Federal purposes for the 2011 fiscal year with no changes. The Company has examinations
not yet initiated for Federal purposes for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015. In most cases, the Company has examinations open
for state or local jurisdictions based on the particular jurisdiction s statute of limitations.  

10.
Stock Compensation   

The
Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on their estimated
fair values. Share-based compensation expense included in selling and administrative expenses approximated $0.1 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Long-Term
Incentive Plan    

The
Company s 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2010 Plan ) provides the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
with the discretion to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance
shares, and performance units. Vesting terms vary with each grant and may be subject to vesting upon a  change in control 
of the Company. The total number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2010 Plan is 1,600,000 shares. During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted no restricted stock units or stock options and during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company granted no restricted stock units and 100,000 stock options under the 2010 Plan.  

Options    

As
noted above, under the 2010 Plan, the Company granted options to purchase 100,000 shares during the nine month period ended September
30, 2016. Options to purchase shares of common stock were granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the common stock
on the date of grant and vest immediately or over a five-year period.  

The
weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was $4.20.
There were no stock options granted during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 or during the three and nine month
period ended September 30, 2015. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions:  

The
risk-free interest rate assumptions were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected
volatility was based on historical daily price changes of the Company s stock for one year prior to the date of grant. The
expected life of options is the average number of years the Company estimates that options will be outstanding. The Company considers
groups of associates that have similar historical exercise behavior separately for valuation purposes.  

The
following table summarizes the Company s activities with respect to its stock options for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as follows:  

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total that would have been received by the option holders if all in-the-money
options had been exercised and sold on September 30, 2016.  

As
of September 30, 2016, 420,000 stock option awards were non-vested. Unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards
was approximately $0.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 4.2 years.  

Restricted
Stock Plans     

The
Ballantyne Strong, Inc. 2014 Non-Employee Directors  Restricted Stock Plan (the  2014 Non-Employee Plan ) provides
for the award of restricted shares to outside directors. Shares issued under the 2014 Non-Employee Plan vest the day preceding
the Company s Annual Meeting of Stockholders in the year following issuance. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company granted 45,555 restricted shares with a weighted average grant date fair value of $4.89 under the Non-Employee
Plan.  

In
connection with the restricted stock granted to certain employees and non-employee directors, the Company accrues compensation
expense based on the estimated number of shares expected to be issued utilizing the most current information available to the
Company at the date of the financial statements. The Company estimates the fair value of restricted stock awards based upon the
market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock awards was approximately
$0.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.1 years.  

The
following table summarizes restricted stock activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

Commitments, Contingencies and Concentrations   

Concentrations    

The
Company s top ten customers accounted for approximately 53.3% and 49.8% of total consolidated net revenues for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Trade accounts receivable from these customers represented approximately
35.5% of net consolidated receivables at September 30, 2016. While the Company believes its relationships with such customers
are stable, most arrangements are made by purchase order and are terminable at will by either party. A significant decrease or
interruption in business from the Company s significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company could also be adversely affected by such factors as changes
in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which the Company sells its products.  

Financial
instruments that potentially expose the Company to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of accounts receivable.
The Company sells product to a large number of customers in many different geographic regions. To minimize credit concentration
risk, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers  financial condition.  

Leases

The
Company and its subsidiaries lease plant and office facilities, furniture, autos and equipment under operating leases expiring
through 2021. These leases generally contain renewal options and the Company expects to renew or replace certain of these leases
in the ordinary course of business. The Company s future minimum lease payments for leases at September 30, 2016 are as
follows:  

12.
Business Segment Information   

As
of September 30, 2016 the Company s operations were conducted principally through two business segments: Cinema and Digital
Media. Cinema operations include the sale of digital projection equipment, screens, and sound systems. Digital Media operations
include the delivery of end to end digital signage solutions, video communication solutions, content creation and management and
service of digital signage and digital cinema equipment. The Company allocates resources to business segments and evaluates the
performance of these segments based upon reported segment operating profit. The Company records intercompany sales at cost and
has eliminated all significant intercompany sales in consolidation. The results of discontinued operations are excluded from the
Cinema segment information below.  

Summary
by Business Segments   

Summary
by Geographical Area   

Net
revenues by business segment are to unaffiliated customers. Identifiable assets by geographical area are based on location of
facilities. Net sales by geographical area are based on destination of sales.

Overview   

Ballantyne
Strong, Inc. ( BTN ,  Ballantyne ,  the Company ,  we ,  our ,
and  us ) is a holding company with diverse business activities focused on serving the cinema, retail, financial and
government markets. The Company and its subsidiaries design, integrate, and install technology solutions for a broad range of
applications; develop and deliver out-of-home messaging, advertising and communications; manufacture projection screens; and provide
managed services including monitoring of networked equipment to our customers. We add value through our design, engineering, manufacturing
excellence and customer service.  

We
conduct our operations through two primary business segments: Cinema and Digital Media. The Cinema segment provides a full range
of products and services to the theatre exhibition industry from the design and installation of new theatre exhibition systems
and related equipment to complete film-to-digital theatre conversion services. The systems include a wide spectrum of premier
audio-visual products and accessories such as: digital projectors, state of the art projection screens, servers and library management
systems, menu boards, flat panel displays, and sound systems. The Digital Media segment delivers solutions and services across
two primary markets: digital out-of-home and cinema. These markets are served through the capabilities the Company has from our
Convergent and Strong Technical Services ( STS ) businesses, respectively. While there is digital signage equipment
sold within this segment, the primary focus of this segment is providing solutions and services to our customers.  

Our
segments were determined based on the manner in which management organizes segments for making operating decisions and assessing
performance. Approximately 57% of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were from Cinema and approximately
43% were from Digital Media. Additional information related to our reporting segments can be found in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.  

On
June 21, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved a plan under which the Company will pursue a sale of the operations
conducted by its subsidiaries Strong Westrex (Beijing) Technology Inc. ( SWBTI ) and Strong Westrex Inc. (the  China
Operations ) which was historically included in the Cinema segment. We expect to complete the sale within the next twelve
months. The purpose of the plan is to focus the efforts of the Company on the business units that have opportunities for higher
return on invested capital. We reflected the results of the China Operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  

On
November 4, 2016, the Company sold SWBTI to GABO Filter, Inc. for total proceeds of $0.4 million. As part of this sale
the Company expects to record a loss on discontinued operations of approximately $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The
final loss from discontinued operations related to this sale may differ from this estimate depending on the actual proceeds received
and the actual disposition costs incurred. In addition, the Company expects to incur charges of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter
related to severance for discontinued operations in conjunction with the sale of SWBTI.  

Results
of Operations:   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues   

Net
revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 5.5% to $18.7 million from $19.7 million during the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  

Cinema     

Sales
of cinema products and services increased 0.2% to $11.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $11.0 million in the third quarter
of 2015. This increase was driven by a $0.2 million increase in digital cinema products and services and a $0.1 million increase
in screen sales, offset by a $0.1 million decrease in lighting and security sales as those businesses were exited in 2015.  

Digital
Media     

Sales
of digital media products and services decreased 12.0% to $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $9.0 million in the third
quarter of 2015. Sales of products and services related to cinema equipment maintenance and digital signage as well as content
creation, management and distribution decreased $1.0 million.  

Export
Revenues   

Sales
outside the United States (primarily from the cinema segment) decreased to $4.0 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $4.3
million a year ago resulting primarily from decreased sales in Canada, Mexico, and Europe, offset by increased sales in China.
Export sales are sensitive to worldwide economic and political conditions that lead to volatility. Certain areas of the world
are more cost conscious than the U.S. market and there are instances where our products are priced higher than local manufacturers
making it more difficult to generate sufficient profit to justify selling into these regions. Additionally, foreign exchange rates
and excise taxes sometimes make it difficult to market our products overseas at reasonable selling prices.  

Gross
Profit   

Consolidated
gross profit was $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2015, gross profit as a percent
of revenue was 23.4% and 19.1% in the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2015, respectively. Gross profit in the cinema
segment decreased to $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2015 and decreased as
a percentage of sales to 24.8% in 2016 from 29.2% in 2015. The decrease in gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of sales
from the cinema segment was driven by increases in inventory valuation and warranty reserves.  

The
gross profit in the digital media segment increased to $1.6 million or 20.6% as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter
of 2016 from $0.6 million or 6.2% as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in gross margin was driven
by more favorable absorption of our fixed operating costs as revenues increased compared to prior year.  

Selling
Expenses   

Selling
expenses increased 11.1% to $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.0 million a year-ago and as a percentage
of revenues increased to 6.0% from 5.1% a year-ago. The increase in selling expenses was primarily due to increased employee related
costs.  

Administrative
Expenses   

Administrative
expenses decreased 20.0% to $3.0 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2015
and as a percent of total revenue decreased to 16.0% in the third quarter of 2016 from 18.9% in the third quarter of 2015. The
decrease in expenses is primarily due to lower compensation related costs resulting from our 2015 strategic restructuring.  

Other
Financial Items   

The
third quarter of 2016 includes insignificant total other income due to various insignificant income and expense items.  

The
effective tax rate differs from the statutory rates primarily as a result of the valuation allowance recorded against the Company s
U.S. tax jurisdiction deferred tax assets and differing foreign and U.S. tax rates applied to respective pre-tax earnings by tax
jurisdiction.  

As
a result of the items outlined above, we generated net loss from continuing operations of approximately ($0.5) million and basic
and diluted loss per share from continuing operations of ($0.03) in the third quarter of 2016 compared to net loss from continuing
operations of ($2.5) million and basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations of ($0.18) a year-ago, respectively.  

Results
of Discontinued Operations   

Our
discontinued operations were insignificant in the third quarter of 2016 compared to an after tax loss of ($0.7) million and basic
and diluted loss per share of ($0.05) in the third quarter of 2015.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues   

Net
revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 0.7% to $56.3 million from $56.7 million during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.  

Cinema     

Sales
of cinema products and services decreased 5.0% to $32.1 million in the first nine months of 2016 from $33.8 million in the first
nine months of 2015. This decrease was driven by a $1.4 million decrease in digital cinema products and services and a $1.4 million
decrease in lighting and security sales as those businesses were exited in 2015. These decreases were offset by a $1.1 million
increase in screen sales.  

Digital
Media     

Sales
of digital media products and services increased 6.6% to $25.4 million in the first nine months of 2016 from $23.8 million in
the first nine months of 2015. Sales of products and services related to cinema equipment maintenance and digital signage as well
as content creation, management and distribution increased $1.6 million.  

Export
Revenues   

Sales
outside the United States (primarily from the cinema segment) decreased to $12.2 million in the first nine months of 2016 from
$13.3 million in the first nine months of 2015 resulting primarily from decreased sales in Latin America, Europe, Mexico and Canada,
offset by increased sales in China. Certain areas of the world are more cost conscious than the U.S. market and there are instances
where our products are priced higher than local manufacturers making it more difficult to generate sufficient profit to justify
selling into these regions. Additionally, foreign exchange rates and excise taxes sometimes make it difficult to market our products
overseas at reasonable selling prices.  

Gross
Profit   

Consolidated
gross profit was $15.8 million in the first nine months of 2016 and $11.5 million in the first nine months of 2015, gross profit
as a percent of revenue was 28.0% and 20.3% in the first nine months of 2016 and the first nine months of 2015, respectively.
Gross profit in the cinema segment increased to $10.0 million in the first nine months of 2016 from $8.4 million in the first
nine months of 2015 and increased as a percentage of sales to 31.2% in 2016 from 25.0% in 2015. The increase in gross margin was
driven by write-offs of inventory in 2015.  

The
gross profit in the digital media segment increased to $5.8 million or 22.7% as a percentage of revenues in the first nine months
of 2016 from $3.1 million or 13.0% as a percentage of revenues in the first nine months of 2015. The increase in gross margin
was driven by more favorable absorption of our fixed operating costs as revenues increased compared to prior year.  

Selling
Expenses   

Selling
expenses decreased 16.4% to $3.3 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $3.9 million a year-ago and as a percentage
of revenues decreased to 5.9% from 7.0% a year-ago. The decrease in selling expenses was primarily due to decreased employee related
costs.  

Administrative
Expenses   

Administrative
expenses decreased 18.5% to $9.1 million in the first nine months of 2016 from $11.2 million in the first nine months
of 2015 and as a percent of total revenue decreased to 16.3% in the first nine months of 2016 from 19.7% in the first nine months
of 2015. The decrease in expenses is primarily due to lower compensation related costs resulting from our 2015 strategic restructuring.  

Other
Financial Items   

The
first nine months of 2016 includes total other expense of $0.8 million primarily related to $1.0 million of net losses on foreign
currency transactions and $0.4 million of decrease in market value of marketable securities, offset by $0.5 million of excess
joint venture distributions recognized as income. The first nine months of 2015 includes total other income of $0.1 million primarily
related to $1.3 million of net gains on foreign currency transactions and $0.3 million of net interest income, offset by a loss
of $1.6 million related to the fair value adjustment to notes receivable.  

The
effective tax rate differs from the statutory rates primarily as a result of the valuation allowance recorded against the Company s
U.S. tax jurisdiction deferred tax assets and differing foreign and U.S. tax rates applied to respective pre-tax earnings by tax
jurisdiction.  

As
a result of the items outlined above, we generated net earnings from continuing operations of approximately $0.5 million and basic
and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.03 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to net loss from
continuing operations of ($15.2) million and basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations of ($1.08) a year-ago,
respectively.  

Results
of Discontinued Operations   

Our
discontinued operations generated an after tax loss of ($0.7) million and basic and diluted loss per share of ($0.05) in the first
nine months of 2016 compared to an after tax loss of ($1.1) million and basic and diluted loss per share of ($0.07) in the first
nine months of 2015, respectively.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

During
the past several years, we have met our working capital and capital resource needs from either our operating or investing cash
flows or a combination of both. We ended the third quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $13.8 million compared to $17.9
million at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, $8.3 million of the $13.8 million in cash and cash equivalents was
held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to pay U.S. income
taxes and foreign withholding taxes on a portion of these funds when repatriated back to the U.S.  

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities   

Net
cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was $0.5 million in the first nine months of 2016, which included
net income from continuing operations of $0.5 million, offset by non-cash charges (benefits) of deferred tax expense, depreciation
and amortization, reserve provisions, equity method investment income, change in value of marketable securities and, excess
distribution from joint ventures non-cash stock compensation totaling $1.8 million. Changes in working capital decreased
cash from operating activities of continuing operations by $2.3 million, primarily due an increase in inventories and a decrease
in current income taxes. Inventories increased $0.7 million primarily due to timing of customer orders at the end of the quarter.
Current income taxes decreased $1.7 million primarily due to payments for Canadian income taxes.  

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 million in the first nine months of 2015, which included a net loss from continuing
operations of $15.2 million, offset by non-cash charges (benefits) of deferred tax expense, depreciation and amortization, reserve
provisions, equity method investment income, fair value adjustment to notes receivable, impairment of intangibles, and non-cash
stock compensation totaling $14.9 million. Changes in working capital benefitted cash from operating activities of continuing
operations of $5.2 million, primarily due to decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in accounts
payable. Accounts receivable balances decreased $6.1 million due to decreased sales in the first nine months of 2015 compared
to the last nine months of 2014. Accounts payable balances decreased $1.0 million due to payments made to vendors during the first
nine months of 2015 for purchases made to fulfill orders during the fourth quarter of 2014.  

Net
cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was $1.6 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared
to net cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations of $0.4 million in the first nine months of 2015.  

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities   

Net
cash used in investing activities amounted to $5.0 million in the first nine months of 2016 due to $4.1 million in purchases
of equity securities and $1.1 million for capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $1.0 million
in the first nine months of 2015 and was primarily for capital expenditures.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities   

Net
cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2016 was $0.3 million and primarily for purchase of treasury stock
and payment on capital leases. Cash flows from financing activities were minimal in the first nine months of 2015.  

The
effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from continuing operations increased (decreased) cash and cash equivalents by $0.8
million and ($1.2) million in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The
effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from discontinued operations decreased cash and cash equivalents by $0.1 million in
the first nine months of 2016 and 2015.  

Hedging
and Trading Activities   

Our
primary exposure to foreign currency fluctuations pertains to our subsidiaries in Canada and China. In certain instances, the
Company may enter into a foreign exchange contract to manage a portion of this risk. We do not have any trading activities that
include non-exchange traded contracts at fair value.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   

The
future estimated payments under these arrangements are summarized below along with our other contractual obligations:  

There
were no other material contractual obligations other than inventory and property, plant and equipment purchases in the ordinary
course of business.  

Seasonality   

Generally,
our quarterly revenue and earnings fluctuate moderately from quarter to quarter. As we increase our sales in our current markets,
and as we expand into new markets in different geographies, it is possible we may experience different seasonality patterns in
our business. As a result, the results of operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for an entire fiscal year.  

Litigation   

From
time to time we may be involved in various claims and legal actions which are routine litigation matters incidental to the business.
In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

See
Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of recently
issued accounting pronouncements.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

In
preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management must
make a variety of decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. These decisions include the selection
of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In making these
decisions, management applies its judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and our historical
experience.  

Our
accounting policies and estimates that are most critical to the presentation of our results of operations and financial condition,
and which require the greatest use of judgments and estimates by management, are designated as our critical accounting policies.
See further discussion of our critical accounting policies under Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our year ended December 31,
2015. We periodically re-evaluate and adjust our critical accounting policies as circumstances change. There were no significant
changes in our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     

The
principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We market our products
throughout the United States and the world. As a result, we could be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign
currency rates and weak economic conditions. As a majority of our sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, a strengthening
of the dollar can and sometimes has made our products less competitive in foreign markets.  

Interest
Rates Interest rate risks from our interest related accounts such as our postretirement obligations are not deemed significant.
We currently have long-term notes receivables bearing interest rates of 15% which are recorded at fair value. A change in long-term
interest rates for comparable types of instruments would have the effect of us recording changes in fair value through our statement
of operations.  

Foreign
Exchange Exposures to transactions denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency are primarily
related to our China and Canadian subsidiaries. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures, which can adversely
affect our results of operations. From time to time, as market conditions indicate, we will enter into foreign currency contracts
to manage the risks associated with forecasted transactions. A portion of our cash in the China and Canadian subsidiaries is denominated
in foreign currencies, where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in U.S. dollar terms. A hypothetical
10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately $0.8 million.  

Equity
Price Risk We are exposed to equity price risk related to certain of our investments in equity securities. At September
30, 2016, our equity securities aggregated $9.8 million, of which $2.0 million represented marketable securities that are reported
at fair value, and $7.8 million accounted for using the equity-method. A change in the equity price of the marketable securities
or equity method investments would result in a change in the fair value or economic value, respectively, of such securities.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures     

The
Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including
the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the
reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended) is (1) accumulated and communicated
to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and (2) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal
quarter for the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, such
internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II.
Other Information    

Item
1. Legal Proceedings     

In
the ordinary course of business operations, we are involved, from time to time, in certain legal disputes. No such disputes, individually
or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material effect on our business or financial condition.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors     

Item
1A  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a detailed
discussion of the Company s risk factors. There have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed.  

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds     

On
August 20, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors adopted a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up
to 700,000 shares of our outstanding Common Stock pursuant to a plan adopted under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (as amended). Repurchases during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 are reflected in the following table.
