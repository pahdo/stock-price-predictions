1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Medidata Solutions, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), is the leading global provider of cloud-based solutions for clinical research in life sciences, offering platform technology that transforms clinical development and increases the value of its customers' research investments. The Company was organized as a New York corporation in June 1999 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in May 2000. 
  Except to the extent updated or described below, the Company s significant accounting policies as of   September 30, 2016   are the same as those at   December 31, 2015  , which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on   February 29, 2016  . 
  Basis of Presentation       The accompanying interim condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and applicable rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules that would ordinarily be required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   February 29, 2016  . 
  Except for the changes resulting from early adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No 2016-09, which is described in the "Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements" section of this Note, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , results of its operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , comprehensive income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
  Income Taxes         The Company s interim period provision for income taxes is computed by using an estimate of the annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items taken into account in the relevant period, if any. Each quarter, the annual effective income tax rate is recomputed and if there are material changes in the estimate, a cumulative adjustment is made. 
  Accounts Receivable         Accounts receivable are recorded at original invoice amount less an allowance that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on uncollectible accounts. This allowance is based on an evaluation of the collectability of accounts receivable and prior bad debt experience. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible. Unbilled receivables consist of revenue recognized in excess of billings, substantially all of which is expected to be billed and collected within one year. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , unbilled accounts receivable of   $14.1 million   and   $10.3 million  , respectively, were included in accounts receivable on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. In general, there is a direct relationship between the Company's accounts receivable balance and its transaction volume. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements         In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern  . This new guidance formally establishes management's responsibility to evaluate at each reporting period whether there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date the financial statements are issued, and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim and annual periods thereafter. The Company will adopt ASU No. 2014-15 for the annual reporting period ending December 31, 2016, and the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   ASU No. 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented not as an asset but as a reduction of the carrying amount of the related debt liability, similar to a debt discount. ASU No. 2015-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 retrospectively on January 1, 2016, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements, aside from a balance sheet reclassification. Refer to Note   6  , "Debt," for details. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,   Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  , which provides guidance on whether an entity should account for the fees paid as a customer under a cloud computing arrangement as a license of internal-use software or as a service contract. ASU No. 2015-05 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-05 prospectively on January 1, 2016, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its

consolidated financial statements as the Company accounts for all subscription fees paid under its cloud computing arrangements as service contracts. 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07,   Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).   ASU No. 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy those investments that are measured at fair value using net asset value per share as a practical expedient and requires that sufficient information be provided to permit reconciliation of the fair value of assets categorized within the fair value hierarchy to amounts presented on the balance sheets. ASU No. 2015-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-07 retrospectively on January 1, 2016, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liability, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period; if an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company's early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 in the third quarter of 2016 impacted its consolidated financial statements as follows: 
             
    The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies on equity awards, which were formerly recognized in additional paid-in capital, to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled; adoption of this portion of ASU No. 2016-09 resulted in recognition of deferred tax assets for all excess tax benefits that had not been previously recognized because the related tax deduction had not reduced income taxes payable. This was effected through a   $50.6 million   cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2016. 
                
    The new guidance requires cash flows related to excess tax benefits, which were formerly classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows, to be classified as an operating activity; as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, the Company has classified the excess tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows. Use of the permitted modified retrospective approach has resulted in an offsetting increase of $1.7 million to cash provided by operating activities and cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.     
     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements         There have been no changes in the expected dates of adoption or estimated effects on the Company's consolidated financial statements of recently issued accounting pronouncements from those disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as described below. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,   which enhances the reporting model for financial instruments by amending certain aspects of existing guidance on recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company will adopt ASU No. 2016-01 on January 1, 2018, and is presently evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases,   which replaces previous lease guidance in its entirety with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 842,   Leases.   The new guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for those arrangements classified as operating leases under previous guidance, with the exception of leases with a term of twelve months or less. The new guidance also adds quantitative and qualitative disclosure requirements around leasing activities. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, and requires a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU No. 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, and is presently evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which addresses the diversity in practice around presentation of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and may consider early adoption, which is permitted in any interim or annual period.

2.     STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY    
  Common Stock       Common stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held. Common stockholders may receive dividends if and when the Board of Directors determines, at its sole discretion. 
  Treasury Stock       From time to time, the Company grants nonvested restricted stock awards ("RSAs"), restricted stock units ("RSUs"), and performance-based restricted stock units ("PBRSUs") to its employees pursuant to the terms of its Second Amended and Restated 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  2009 Plan ). Under the provisions of the 2009 Plan, unless otherwise elected, participants fulfill their related income tax withholding obligation by having shares withheld at the time of vesting. On the date of vesting, the Company divides the participant's income tax withholding obligation in dollars by the closing price of its common stock and withholds the resulting number of vested shares. The shares withheld are then transferred to the Company's treasury stock at cost for future reissuance. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company withheld   338,523   shares at an average price of   $36.22   and   338,792   shares at an average price of   $50.27  , respectively, in connection with the vesting of equity awards. 
  Nonvested RSAs forfeited by plan participants are transferred to the Company's treasury stock at par. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   132,626   and   80,752   forfeited shares, respectively, were transferred to treasury stock at their par value of   $0.01  . 
   
  3.     INVESTMENTS    
  Marketable Securities 
  Marketable securities, which the Company classifies as available-for-sale securities, primarily consist of high quality commercial paper, corporate bonds, and U.S. government debt obligations. Marketable securities with remaining effective maturities of twelve months or less from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term; otherwise, they are classified as long-term on the consolidated balance sheet. 
  The following table provides the Company s marketable securities by security type as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

Contractual maturities of the Company s marketable securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $0.5 million   of gross unrealized losses primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of certain corporate bonds.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Investments that are impaired are those that are considered to have losses that are other-than-temporary. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include: 
      the length of time and extent to which fair value has been lower than the cost basis; 
     the financial condition, credit quality and near-term prospects of the investee; and 
     whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery. 
  As the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be until maturity, the Company has determined that the gross unrealized losses on such investments at   September 30, 2016   are temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Company did not consider its investments in marketable securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following tables provide the fair market value and the gross unrealized losses of the Company's marketable securities with unrealized losses, aggregated by security type, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded an insignificant amount of net realized gains from the sale of marketable securities. 
  Cost Method Investment 
  In August 2016, the Company purchased shares of Series B Preferred Stock of SHYFT Analytics, Inc. ("SHYFT") via a private placement. This investment is accounted for under the cost method and is included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet   as of   September 30, 2016   at its purchase price of   $4.0 million  . 
  The Company's vice chairman, Steven Hirschfeld, has served on the board of directors of SHYFT since 2014 in an individual capacity and not as a representative of the Company.

4.     FAIR VALUE    
  The following table summarizes, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, according to the fair value hierarchy described in our significant accounting policies included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):   

  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had no financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and none of its financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis relied upon Level 3 inputs. 
  Investments in commercial paper, corporate bonds, and U.S. government agency debt securities have been classified as Level 2 as they are valued using quoted prices in less active markets or other directly or indirectly observable inputs. Fair values of corporate bonds and U.S. government agency debt securities were derived from a consensus or weighted-average price based on input of market prices from multiple sources at each reporting period. With regard to commercial paper, all of the securities had high credit ratings and one year or less to maturity; therefore, fair value was derived from accretion of purchase price to face value over the term of maturity or quoted prices for similar instruments if available. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   transfers of financial assets between Level 1 and Level 2. 
  The carrying amounts of all other current financial assets and current financial liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 
   
  5.     GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS    
  On   April 1, 2016  , the Company acquired Intelemage, LLC ("Intelemage"), a medical image sharing and workflow management company for a net purchase price of   $17.2 million  , broadening its offerings with the addition of digital image management technology. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of the following intangible assets (in thousands): 

The change in the carrying amount of goodwill during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016    was as follows (in thousands):

  The Company's 1.00% convertible senior notes (the "Notes"), issued in August 2013, consisted of the following components as of   September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015   (in thousands):   

  On January 1, 2016, the Company retrospectively adopted ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   which requires unamortized debt issuance costs to be presented as a reduction of the carrying amount of the related debt liability, similar to a debt discount. This resulted in the reclassification of   $3.3 million   in unamortized debt issuance costs from other assets to 1.00% convertible senior notes on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  As of     September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  , the estimated fair value of the Notes was     $332.9 million     and     $313.0 million  , respectively. The Company considers this disclosure     to be a Level 2 measurement because it is based upon a recent modeled bid-price quote for the Notes, reflecting activity in a less than active market. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Notes are not convertible. Based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on   September 30, 2016   of   $55.76  , which is less than the Notes' initial conversion price of   $58.05  , the if-converted value of the Notes was less than their principal amount. 
   As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining life of the Notes was approximately   22 months  .

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $23.15   and   $19.99  , respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $17.92   and   $21.81  , respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $4.4 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $7.4 million   and   $14.1 million  , respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.7 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $3.8 million   and   $3.5 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $6.8 million   in unrecognized compensation cost related to all non-vested stock options granted.

  R  estricted Stock Awards and Units 
  The following table summarizes the status of the Company s nonvested time-based RSAs and RSUs as of   September 30, 2016  , and changes during the   nine   months then ended (in thousands, except per share data):   

  The total fair value of RSAs and RSUs vested during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.5 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively.

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $60.4 million   in unrecognized compensation cost related to all nonvested RSAs and RSUs granted. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of   2.72 years  . 
  Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units 
  No PBRSUs were granted during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   223 thousand   PBRSUs ("2016 TSR PBRSUs") with   market conditions based on the Company's total stockholder return ("TSR") relative to that of the Russell 2000 Index over the three-year period ending December 31, 2018, vesting in full in three years with the number of PBRSUs ultimately earned ranging from zero to 200% of the target number of shares  . The Company also granted an insignificant number of other PBRSUs with performance conditions based on achievement of certain individual performance objectives. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company granted   242 thousand   PBRSUs ("2015 TSR PBRSUs") with   market conditions based on the Company's TSR relative to that of the Russell 2000 Index over the one-, two-, and three-year periods ending December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, vesting in equal parts over three years with the number of PBRSUs ultimately earned ranging from zero to 200% of the target number of shares  . 
  The fair value of PBRSUs with market conditions granted during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was estimated as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions:

The following table summarizes the status of the Company s PBRSUs based upon expected performance as of   September 30, 2016  , and changes during the   nine   months then ended (in thousands, except per share data):   

  The total fair value of PBRSUs vested during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively. The total fair value of PBRSUs vested during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $10.1 million   and   $10.7 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $12.6 million   in unrecognized compensation cost related to all nonvested PBRSUs. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of   1.60 years  . 
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
  The fair value of shares granted under the Company's employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP") was estimated using a Black-Scholes pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:   

  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   89 thousand   shares were purchased under the ESPP at a weighted-average price of   $38.35  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   86 thousand   shares were purchased under the ESPP at a weighted-average price of   $37.93  .   No   shares were purchased under the ESPP during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $5.4 million   in unrecognized compensation cost related to ESPP shares. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining period of   1.59 years  . 
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company increased the number of shares reserved under the ESPP from   0.3 million   to   0.8 million  . 
  Modifications 
  Net incremental expense associated with modifications to stock options, RSAs, RSUs, and PBRSUs during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.1 million   and   $0.5 million   in the aggregate, respectively, and immaterial on an individual basis. 
  No   equity awards were modified during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , net incremental expense associated with modifications was   $1.3 million   as a result of the Company's CFO transition in the second quarter of 2015.

8.     ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) 
  The changes in the balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are as follows (in thousands):   

  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , reclassifications of items from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income were insignificant. 
   
  9.     EARNINGS PER SHARE    
  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. The holders of unvested RSAs do not have nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents and therefore, such unvested awards do not qualify as participating securities and are excluded from the basic earnings per share calculation. Diluted earnings per share includes the determinants of basic net income per share and, in addition, gives effect to the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock are exercised, vested, or converted into common stock, unless they are antidilutive. As the Company intends to settle the principal amount of the Notes (see Note   6  , "Debt") in cash upon conversion, their dilutive effect, if any, will be reflected in diluted earnings per share using the treasury stock method, which considers the number of shares that would be required to settle any premium above principal at the average stock price for the period. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the average price of the Company's stock was below the conversion price of the Notes; as a result the Notes were not dilutive for these periods. 
  A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is shown in the following table (in thousands, except per share data):

10.     INCOME TAXES 
  The Company had approximately   $3.7 million   and   $8.1 million   of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The   $4.4 million   decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily the result of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") concluding its examination of the Company's 2012 federal income tax return. The Company redetermined its unrecognized tax benefits, including similar items in open tax years, based on the agreed adjustments with the IRS and other associated information and analysis, resulting in a discrete item in the period. 
   
  11.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
  Legal Matters         The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business and records an estimated liability for these matters when an adverse outcome is considered to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Although the outcome of the litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims, or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the Company, which could materially and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations, the Company does not believe that it is currently a party to any material legal proceedings. 
  On March 4, 2011, DataTrak International, Inc. ("DataTrak") filed a complaint for alleged patent infringement against the Company in DataTrak International v. Medidata Solutions, C.A. No. 1:11-cv-00458 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (the "NDOH District Court"). The complaint asserted infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,464,087 (the  '087 Patent ). On November 6, 2015, the NDOH District Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss DataTrak's complaint on the grounds that the '087 Patent is invalid for lack of patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C.  101. On January 5, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement resolving all related aspects of its litigation with DataTrak. No monies were exchanged.    
  Contractual Warranties           The Company typically provides contractual warranties to its customers covering its solutions and services. To date, any refunds provided to customers have been immaterial.    
  Change in Control Agreements         The Company has change in control agreements with its chief executive officer and certain other executive officers. These agreements provide for payments to be made to such officers upon involuntary termination of their employment by the Company without cause or by such officers for good reason as defined in the agreements, within a period of 2 years following a change in control. The agreements provide that, upon a qualifying termination event, such officers will be entitled to (a) a severance payment equal to the sum of the officer s base salary and target bonus amount (except that such payment for the Company's chief executive officer and president would be two times such sum); (b) continuation of health benefits for one year (except that such continuation for the Company's chief executive officer and president would be for two years); and (c) immediate vesting of remaining unvested equity awards, unless otherwise specified in the equity award agreements.

Results of Operations 
  Revenues 
  Revenues for the   three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:   

  Year-over-year growth in subscription revenues was driven by major platform customer wins and strong sales growth among both new and existing customers, with strong contributions from our electronic data capture and risk-based monitoring solutions. We added 90 and 222 clients in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, including those added via the acquisition of Intelemage, to end the quarter with 789 clients, up 38% compared with   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had remaining subscription backlog of   $101 million  , representing the future contract value of outstanding arrangements, billed and unbilled, to be recognized during the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding renewals. This reflects an increase of 24% compared with remaining backlog of $82 million at   September 30, 2015  . 
  Year-over-year growth in professional services revenues was driven by increased demand from new and existing customers for implementation and other professional services. High utilization associated with large scale enterprise implementation projects during the quarter resulted in record professional services revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Cost of Revenues 
  Cost of revenues for the   three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows:   

  Year-over-year growth in cost of subscription revenues was driven by increases in vendor software and third-party cloud hosting costs of $1.8 million and $4.6 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, resulting from increased platform activity and platform enhancements, and from investment in hosting infrastructure at our data center in Europe. In addition, our business growth drove a year-over-year headcount increase of roughly 15%, resulting in increases to personnel costs of $1.2 million and $3.4 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. Subscription gross margin decreased to   84.2%   and   84.0%   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   85.9%   and   85.6%   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, as a result of these infrastructure and skill set investments.

     Table of Contents  

Year-over-year growth in cost of professional fees was partially driven by increases in consulting costs of $2.0 million and $4.3 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. Personnel costs were also a contributing factor, increasing $0.6 million and $1.1 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, in response to 13% year-over-year headcount growth. Professional services gross margin increased to   29.0%   and   27.0%   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with   27.6%   and   25.0%   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, benefiting from effective project mix and more efficient use of resources during the current year. 
  Overall gross margin decreased to   75.7%   and   75.5%   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   77.9%   and   76.9%   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, driven by lower subscription margins and a greater mix of professional services in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016. 
  Operating Costs and Expenses 
  Operating costs and expenses for the   three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:   

  The year-over-year growth in research and development expenses was primarily driven by net increases in personnel-related costs of $2.8 million and $11.0 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, resulting from a 19% year-over-year headcount increase due to our hiring of skilled engineering talent. Increased fees for specialized consultants and outside experts of $0.6 million and $3.0 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, associated with investments to enhance the value of our platform, were also a contributor. Stock-based compensation expense increased $0.2 million and $0.9 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
  The year-over-year growth in sales and marketing expenses was predominantly driven by net increases in personnel-related costs of $1.5 million and $6.4 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, resulting from a 7% year-over-year headcount increase to expand our global sales organization and partner team, as well as higher sales bonus achievement. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million and $1.8 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to certain material equity awards having fully vested during the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016. 
  The year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses for   three months ended September 30, 2016   was driven by a net increase in personnel-related costs of $1.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $1.0 million. The year-over-year decrease in general and administrative expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   resulted predominantly from a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $5.6 million and $1.8 million lower legal fees due to the settlement of patent-related litigation in January 2016, partially offset by a $4.2 million increase in personnel-related costs. Year-over-year, general and administrative headcount increased 11%. 
  In the first quarter of 2016, the state of New Jersey enacted legislation that allows us to recognize grants associated with the New Jersey Business Employment Incentive Program ("NJ BEIP"), which incentivizes businesses to locate and expand jobs in New Jersey. The benefits of these grants were applied against the underlying salary expense relating to our employees in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions in New Jersey in the first quarter, reducing total operating expenses by $2.3 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The NJ BEIP did not have a material impact on operating expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , and is not expected to have a material impact on future periods. 
  In 2012, we signed an incentive proposal under New York State's Empire State Development ("ESD") Excelsior Jobs Program ("Excelsior"). Excelsior provides qualifying taxpayers with refundable tax credits related to new or expanding operations in New York State. The 2012 agreement provided for credits of $2.8 million over a ten-year period beginning in 2014, resulting in an

immaterial quarterly benefit. In the third quarter of 2016, we received and signed a new, larger Excelsior incentive proposal that provides for an additional $17.0 million of credits over a ten-year period beginning in 2016. The benefits of all Excelsior credits are applied against underlying salary expense and reduced total operating expenses by $0.5 million and $1.0 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  Income Taxes 
  Provision for income taxes for the   three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows:   

  The difference between our effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate is primarily due to the relative mix of pre-tax income subject to tax in various jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, share-based compensation, change in tax reserves, and U.S. tax credits. The benefit from U.S. credits will likely continue to have a favorable impact on our overall effective tax rate in the future. In the first quarter of 2016, the Internal Revenue Service concluded its examination of our 2012 federal income tax return. As a result, we redetermined our unrecognized tax benefits for previously recorded reserves, resulting in a material discrete item in the period. 
  Our quarterly tax provision and quarterly estimate of the annual effective tax rate are subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accuracy of predictions of pre-tax book and taxable income or loss, the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in tax law in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2016 to be closer to the U.S. statutory rate. 
   
  Critical Accounting Estimates 
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events. These estimates inherently involve levels of subjectivity and judgment and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting estimates as of   September 30, 2016   are the same as those at   December 31, 2015  , which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We believe that our cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and highly liquid marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for the foreseeable future. Our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors, including any expansion of our business that we may complete. The following table presents selected financial information related to our liquidity and capital resources as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and the   nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cash provided by operating activities of   $48.4 million   was driven by strong customer collections, partially offset by operating expenditures and cash interest expense on our 1.00% convertible senior notes. Cash used in investing activities of   $28.0 million   consisted of a net payment of   $17.2 million   to acquire Intelemage, LLC ("Intelemage"), cash payments for capital expenditures of   $15.9 million  , and   $4.0 million   cost method investment, partially offset by net sales of marketable securities of   $9.0 million  . Cash used in financing activities of   $5.1 million   resulted primarily from the acquisition of   $14.4 million   of treasury stock in connection with equity plan participant tax withholdings upon vesting, partially offset by equity plan proceeds of   $9.5 million  . 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , cash provided by operating activities of   $58.2 million   was driven by strong customer collections, partially offset by operating expenditures and cash interest expense on our 1.00% convertible senior notes. Cash used in investing activities of   $28.0 million   consisted of net purchases of marketable securities of   $16.5 million   and cash payments for capital expenditures of   $11.0 million  . Cash used in financing activities of   $6.5 million   resulted primarily from the acquisition of   $16.9 million   of treasury stock in connection with equity plan participant tax withholdings upon vesting, partially offset by equity plan proceeds of   $10.4 million  . 
  Capital Assets 
  We acquired   $13.0 million   in capital assets during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , predominantly related to our new office spaces in Iselin, NJ and San Francisco, CA, as well as investments in our new European data center. On a cash basis, our capital expenditures during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $15.9 million   and included payments for previously accrued assets. We expect to acquire approximately $4 to $5 million in additional capital assets during the remainder of 2016, primarily related to data center investments. 
  Debt 
  In August 2013, we issued   $287.5 million   of   1.00%   convertible senior notes (the "Notes") that will mature on August 1, 2018 unless earlier repurchased or converted. Upon conversion, we will deliver to the holders of the Notes either cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. If converted, we intend to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash and any excess conversion value beyond the principal amount in shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination thereof. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Notes are not convertible and therefore are classified as long term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. For further information, see Note   6  ,  Debt,  to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
  The table below summarizes the aggregate effect that our material contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   are expected to have on our cash flows in the periods indicated (in thousands):   

  Legal Matters 
  For a discussion of legal matters, refer to Note   11  , "Commitments and Contingencies   Legal Matters," to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Interest Rate Sensitivity 
  We had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling   $65.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Our cash equivalents are invested principally in commercial paper and money market funds. We also had investments in marketable securities, which we classify as available-for-sale securities, totaling   $419.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Substantially all of our marketable securities are fixed income securities, which primarily consist of high quality commercial paper and corporate bonds. Due to the short duration, laddered maturities, and high credit ratings of these investments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. 
  Exchange Rate Sensitivity 
  Our non-U.S. operating subsidiaries are located in the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and China. The functional currencies for these subsidiaries are the respective local currencies. We have exposure to exchange rate movements that are captured in translation adjustments for these subsidiaries. Such cumulative adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The estimated potential translation loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounted to   $1.5 million  . 
  We bill our customers primarily in U.S. dollars. Any billings in foreign currency are billed from Medidata Solutions, Inc., a U.S. entity, and are mainly denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Australian dollars, and Canadian dollars. Our foreign currency-denominated costs and expenses are mainly incurred by our non-U.S. operating subsidiaries. Accordingly, future changes in currency exchange rates will impact our future operating results. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   4.7%   of our revenues and   17.0%   of our expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains (losses) in general and administrative expenses on our condensed consolidated statements of operations and amounted to   $0.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Inflation 
  We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
   
  Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation was performed with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  .

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.    Legal Proceedings 
  See Note   11  ,  Commitments and Contingencies   Legal Matters,  to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of current legal proceedings. 
   
  Item 1A.    Risk Factors 
  We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   are those that we believe are the material risks we face. There have been no material changes in our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , except that the following language shall be added to the end of the first bullet point in the list of risks identified in the in the risk factor titled   Our revenues derived from international operations are subject to risks that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  : "and the United Kingdom referendum to withdraw from the European Union ('Brexit')." Any of those disclosed risk factors or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   
  Item 2.     Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
  From time to time, we grant nonvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, or performance-based restricted stock units to our employees pursuant to the terms of our Second Amended and Restated 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2009 Plan"). Under the provisions of the 2009 Plan, unless otherwise elected, participants fulfill their related income tax withholding obligation by having shares withheld at the time of vesting. On the date of vesting, we divide the participant's income tax withholding obligation in dollars by the closing price of our common stock and withhold the resulting number of vested shares. 
  A summary of our repurchases of shares of our common stock for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows:
