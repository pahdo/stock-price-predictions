  NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION 
  General 
  Except where the context suggests otherwise, the terms  we,   us,   our  and the  Company  refer to Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust, Inc. The terms  Advisor  and  LaSalle  refer to LaSalle Investment Management, Inc. 
  Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust, Inc. is an externally managed, daily valued perpetual-life real estate investment trust ("REIT") that owns and manages a diversified portfolio of apartment, industrial, office, retail and other properties located primarily in the United States. We expect over time that our real estate portfolio will be further diversified on a global basis through the acquisition of additional properties outside of the United States and will be complemented by investments in real estate-related debt and equity securities. We were incorporated on   May 28, 2004   under the laws of the State of Maryland. We believe that we have operated in such a manner to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2004, when we first elected REIT status. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned interests in a total of   68   properties, 67 of which are located in   17   states and one of which is located in Canada. 
  From our inception to October 1, 2012, we raised equity proceeds through private offerings of shares of our common stock. On October 1, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") declared effective our Registration Statement on Form S-11 with respect to our continuous public offering of up to   $3,000,000   in any combination of Class A and Class M shares of common stock (the "Initial Public Offering").    As of   January 15, 2015  , the date our Initial Public Offering terminated, we had raised aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A and Class M common stock in our Initial Public Offering of $  268,981  . 
  On January 16, 2015, our follow-on Registration Statement on Form S-11 was declared effective by the SEC (Commission File No. 333-196886) with respect to our continuous public offering of up to   $2,700,000   in any combination of shares of our Class A, Class M, Class A-I and Class M-I common stock, consisting of up to   $2,400,000   of shares offered in our primary offering and up to   $300,000   in shares offered pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (the  First Extended Public Offering ).  We reserve the right to terminate the First Extended Public Offering at any time and to extend the First Extended Public Offering term to the extent permissible under applicable law.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have raised aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A, Class M, Class A-I and Class M-I shares in our First Extended Public Offering of $  812,725  .  
  On June 19, 2014, we began a private offering of up to   $400,000   in any combination of our Class A-I, Class M-I and Class D shares of common stock (the "Initial Private Offering"). Upon the SEC declaring the registration statement for our First Extended Public Offering effective, we terminated the Initial Private Offering.  As of January 15, 2015, we had raised aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A-I, Class M-I and Class D common stock in our Initial Private Offering of approximately $  43,510  .  On March 3, 2015, we commenced a new private offering (the "Follow-on Private Offering") of up to   $350,000   in shares of our Class D common stock with indefinite duration. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have raised aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of our Class D shares in our Follow-on Private Offering of   $67,607  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   61,960,821   shares of Class A common stock,   34,152,734   shares of Class M common stock,   10,466,992   shares of Class A-I common stock,   6,031,998   shares of Class M-I common stock, and   7,876,212   shares of Class D common stock were outstanding and held by a total of   11,179   stockholders.   
  LaSalle acts as our advisor pursuant to the second amended and restated advisory agreement between the Company and LaSalle (the  Advisory Agreement ). On May 10, 2016, we renewed our Advisory Agreement with our Advisor for a one-year term expiring on June 5, 2017.  Our Advisor, a registered investment advisor with the SEC, has broad discretion with respect to our investment decisions and is responsible for selecting our investments and for managing our investment portfolio pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. LaSalle is a wholly-owned, but operationally independent subsidiary of our sponsor, Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated ("JLL" or our "Sponsor"), a New York Stock Exchange-listed global financial and professional services firm specializing in commercial real estate services. Affiliates of our sponsor currently have invested an aggregate of   $50,200   through purchases of shares of our common stock.  We have no employees, as all operations are managed by our Advisor. Our executive officers are employees of and compensated by our Advisor.

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation  
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X and include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, consolidated variable interest entities ("VIE") and the unconsolidated investment in real estate affiliate accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We consider the authoritative guidance of accounting for investments in common stock, investments in real estate ventures, investors accounting for an investee when the investor has the majority of the voting interest but the minority partners have certain approval or veto rights, determining whether a general partner or general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights and the consolidation of VIEs in which we own less than a   100%   interest.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Parenthetical disclosures are shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheets regarding the amounts of VIE assets and liabilities that are consolidated. As of   September 30, 2016  , our VIEs include The District at Howell Mill, The Edge at Lafayette, Grand Lakes Marketplace and Townlake of Coppell due to the limited partnership structures and our partners having limited participation rights and no kick-out rights. The creditors of our VIEs do not have general recourse to us.  Prior to new consolidation guidance adopted on January 1, 2016, Grand Lakes Marketplace and Townlake of Coppell were not classified as VIEs.  VIE disclosures as of December 31, 2015 on our Consolidated Balance Sheets have been updated to include Grand Lakes Marketplace and Townlake of Coppell for comparative purposes. 
  Noncontrolling interests represent the minority members  proportionate share of the equity in our VIEs. At acquisition, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests were measured and recorded at the estimated fair value. Noncontrolling interests will increase for the minority members  share of net income of these entities and contributions and decrease for the minority members  share of net loss and distributions. As of   September 30, 2016  , noncontrolling interests represented the minority members  proportionate share of the equity of the entities listed above as VIEs. 
  The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies described in the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016 (our  2015 Form 10-K ) and should be read in conjunction with such consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following notes to these interim consolidated financial statements highlight changes to the notes included in the   December 31, 2015   audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Form 10-K and present interim disclosures as required by the SEC. 
  The interim financial data as of   September 30, 2016   and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   is unaudited. In our opinion, the interim data includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.   
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
  An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided against the portion of accounts receivable and deferred rent receivable that is estimated to be uncollectible. Such allowance is reviewed periodically based upon our recovery experience. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our allowance for doubtful accounts was   $466   and   $312  , respectively. 
  Deferred Expenses 
  Deferred expenses consist of lease commissions. Lease commissions are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related lease as a component of depreciation and amortization expense. Accumulated amortization of deferred expenses at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $1,863   and   $1,234  , respectively. 
  Acquisitions 
  We have allocated a portion of the purchase price of our acquisitions to acquired intangible assets, which include acquired in-place lease intangibles, acquired above-market in-place lease intangibles and acquired ground lease intangibles, which are reported net of accumulated amortization of   $32,823   and   $21,660   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The acquired intangible liabilities represent acquired below-market in-place leases, which are reported net of accumulated amortization of   $4,801   and   $3,364   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value  
  The Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) guidance for fair value measurement and disclosure states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering assumptions, authoritative guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 
             
    Level 1   Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have access to at the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2   Observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  Level 2 inputs are those in markets for which there are few transactions, the prices are not current, little public information exists or instances where prices vary substantially over time or among brokered market makers. 
                
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  Unobservable inputs are those inputs that reflect our own assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability based on the best available information. 
     The authoritative guidance requires the disclosure of the fair value of our financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The guidance does not apply to all balance sheet items. Market information as available or present value techniques have been utilized to estimate the amounts required to be disclosed. Since such amounts are estimates, there can be no assurance that the disclosed value of any financial instrument could be realized by immediate settlement of the instrument.   
  Partnership interests accounted for under the fair value option are stated at the fair value of our ownership in the partnership.  The fair value is recorded based upon changes in the net asset value of the limited partnership as determined from the financial statements of the limited partnership.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded unrealized changes in fair value classified within the Level 3 category of   $3,638   and $  4,014  , respectively, in our investment in the NYC Retail Portfolio (see    Note 4-Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates   ).  
  We have estimated the fair value of our mortgage notes and other debt payable reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts that are based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies (including discounted cash flow analysis with regard to fixed rate debt) for similar loans made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same maturities. The fair value of our mortgage notes payable using Level 2 inputs was   $12,867   and   $927   higher than the aggregate carrying amounts at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Such fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition of our mortgage notes payable. 
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  We record all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value in prepaid expenses and other assets or accounts payable and other accrued expenses. Changes in the fair value of our derivatives are recorded as a component of interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income as we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges. Our objective in using interest rate derivatives is to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, we use interest rate caps and swaps.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives related to managing our interest rate risk: 

The fair value of our interest rate caps and swaps represent liabilities of   $1,296   and   $153   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  
   9 

Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. For example, significant estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to useful lives of assets, recoverable amounts of receivables, fair value of derivatives and real estate assets, initial valuations and related amortization periods of deferred costs and intangibles, particularly with respect to property acquisitions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Correction of Immaterial Understatement of Liabilities 
  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we identified an immaterial understatement of our liability for dealer manager fees. We previously accrued for dealer manager fees on a daily basis as offering costs, which were recorded as a reduction of capital in excess of par value.  We have subsequently determined that an estimate for the full amount of the future liability for dealer manager fees, up to the regulatory maximum ten percent of the proceeds from the sale of shares in each of our public offerings (excluding distributing reinvestment plan proceeds), should be accrued on the date of sale. Changes in this estimate will be recorded prospectively as an adjustment to capital in excess of par value.  Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 have been corrected to record a liability for future dealer manager fees. Accrued offering costs previously recorded will be reclassified from accounts payable and other accrued expenses to accrued offering costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  This change in accounting policy for dealer manager fees has no impact on our net income or cash flows.  We will also reflect the correction of this immaterial misstatement in comparable prior period amounts in our future filings.   
  The following table summarizes the effects of this change:

NOTE 3 PROPERTY 
  The consolidated properties we acquired during 2016 and our acquisition price of each are as follows:  

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, we incurred $  2,846   and $  1,120  , respectively, of acquisition expenses recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income.  For properties acquired during   2016  , we recorded total revenue of   $7,615   and net loss of   $1,525   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  For properties acquired during   2015  , we recorded total revenue of   $4,887   and net loss of   $2,533   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  We allocated the purchase price for our 2016 acquisitions in accordance with authoritative guidance as follows: 

Proforma Information 
  The following pro forma financial information is presented as if our 2015 and 2016 acquisitions had been consummated on January 1, 2015 or the date the property began operations if operations began after January 1, 2015. The pro forma financial information is for comparative purposes only and not necessarily indicative of what our actual results of operations would have been had our 2015 and 2016 acquisitions been consummated on January 1, 2015 or the date the property began operations, nor does it purport to represent the results of operations for future periods. 
  
   11 

If our 2016 acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2015 or the date the property began operations, our consolidated revenues and net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   would have been   $110,564   and   $3,069  , respectively, and our consolidated revenues and net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   would have been   $93,553   and   $19,956  , respectively.   
  If our 2015 acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2014 or the date the property began operations, our consolidated revenues and net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   would have been   $76,194   and   $28,056  , respectively.   
  2016 Dispositions 
  On March 1, 2016, we sold 36 Research Park Drive for approximately   $7,900   less closing costs.  We recorded a gain on the sale of the property in the amount of   $40  . 
  On September 6, 2016, we sold Campus Lodge Tampa for approximately   $37,750   less closing costs.  In connection with the disposition, the mortgage loan associated with the property totaling   $31,367   was repaid.  We recorded a gain on the sale of the property in the amount of   $1,624   and recorded a gain on the extinguishment of the debt of   $40  .  
  Impairment of Investments in Real Estate 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we determined that     Railway Street Corporate Centre     no longer fits our current investment objectives and strategy and reduced our expected hold period. We further determined that this as  set was impaired as the carrying value of the investment was not deemed recoverable.  Therefore, we recognized an impairment charge totaling   $6,355  , which represents the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the property.  
  The valuation of this asset is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows as well as the income capitalization approach considering prevailing market capitalization and discount rates.  We review each investment based on the highest and best use of the investment and market participation assumptions.  The significant assumptions include the capitalization rate used in the income capitalization valuation and projected property net operating income and net cash flows.  Additionally, the valuation considered bid and ask prices for similar properties.  We have determined that the significant inputs used to value the impaired assets fall within Level 3.  These significant inputs are based on market conditions and our expected growth rates.  A capitalization rate of 7.00% and a discount rate of 8.50% were utilized in the models and are based upon observable rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates.

NOTE 4 UNCONSOLIDATED REAL ESTATE AFFILIATES 
  Fair Value Option Investment 
  NYC Retail Portfolio 
  On December 8, 2015, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired an approximate   28%   interest in a newly formed limited partnership, Madison NYC Core Retail Partners, L.P., which acquired an approximate   49%   interest in entities that initially owned 15 retail properties located in the greater New York City area (the  NYC Retail Portfolio ), the result of which is that we own an approximate   14%   interest in the NYC Retail Portfolio. The purchase price for such portion was approximately   $85,600   including closing costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , the NYC Retail Portfolio owned 14 retail properties totaling approximately   2,567,000   square feet across urban infill locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island and New Jersey.   
  At acquisition we made the election to account for our interest in the NYC Retail Portfolio under the fair value option.   Our investment in the NYC Retail Portfolio will be presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within investments in unconsolidated real estate affiliates.  Changes in the fair value of our investment as well as cash distributions received will be recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income within equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amount of our investment in the NYC Retail Portfolio was   $84,811   and   $85,068  , respectively. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   we recorded increases in fair value of our investment in the NYC Retail Portfolio of   $3,638   and $  4,014  , respectively.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   we received a distribution of income totaling   $1,125  . This cash distribution increased equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we received return of capital distributions totaling   $120   and   $4,495  , respectively, related to the sale of an   84,000   square foot retail property and extinguishment of its mortgage loan.  These distributions reduced the carrying amount of our investment in the 14 property NYC Retail Portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded no changes in fair value of our investment in the NYC Retail Portfolio and received no cash distributions.

NOTE 5 MORTGAGE NOTES AND OTHER DEBT PAYABLE 
  Mortgage notes and other debt payable have various maturities through 2027 and consist of the following: 

(1) 
    On February 17, 2016, we entered into a   $40,000   mortgage note payable on Monument IV at Worldgate. The mortgage note is for seven years and bears a floating interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%. We entered into an interest rate swap for this loan which fixed the interest rate at   3.13%   for the seven year term. 
              (2)  
    On March 17, 2016, we entered into a   $22,800   mortgage note payable on 140 Park Avenue. The mortgage note is for five years and bears a floating interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%. We entered into an interest rate swap for this loan which fixed the interest rate at   3.00%   for the five year term.  
          Aggregate future principal payments of mortgage notes payable as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows:    

Line of Credit  
  On September 19, 2016, we extended and expanded our existing   $100,000   revolving line of credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A to   $150,000  . The line of credit has a one-year term with a   $75,000   six-month extension at our option and bears interest based on LIBOR plus a spread ranging from   1.55%   to   2.25%  , depending on our leverage ratio (  1.55%   spread at   September 30, 2016  ). We intend to use the line of credit to cover short-term capital needs, for new property acquisitions and working capital. We may not draw funds on our line of credit if we (i) experience a material adverse effect, which is defined to include, among other things, (a) a material adverse effect upon the operations, business, assets, liabilities or financial condition of the Company, taken as a whole; (b) a material impairment of the rights and remedies of any lender under any loan document or the ability of any loan party to perform its obligations under any loan document; or (c) a material adverse effect upon the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability against any loan party of any loan document to which it is a party or (ii) are in default, as that term is defined in the agreement, including a cross default under certain other loan agreements and/or guarantees entered into by the Company or its subsidiaries.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we believe no material adverse effects had occurred.  Our line of credit does require us to meet certain customary debt covenants which include a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum debt service coverage ratio as well as maintaining minimum amounts of equity and liquidity.  As of   September 30,  
  
   14 

2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $100,000   and   $30,000  , respectively, in borrowings outstanding on the revolving line of credit.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all debt covenants.   
    
  Debt Issuance Costs 
  Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized over the terms of the respective agreements as a component of interest expense. Accumulated amortization of debt issuance costs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $2,538   and   $2,107  , respectively.  Upon implementing FASB Accounting Standard Update 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   during the period ended March 31, 2016, we reclassified   $2,914   of net debt issuance costs from Deferred expenses, net to Mortgage notes and other debt payable, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. 
   
  NOTE 6 COMMON STOCK 
  We have five classes of common stock authorized as of   September 30, 2016  , Class A, Class M, Class A-I, Class M-I, and Class D.  The fees payable to LaSalle Investment Management Distributors, LLC, an affiliate of our Advisor and the dealer manager for our offerings (the "Dealer Manager"), with respect to each outstanding share of each class, as a percentage of NAV, are as follows: 

(1)  
    Selling commissions are paid on the date of sale of our common stock. 
              (2)  
    We accrue all future dealer manager fees up to the ten percent regulatory limitation as accrued offering costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets on the date of sale of our common stock.  For NAV calculation purposes, dealer manager fees are accrued daily, on a continuous basis equal to 1/365th of the stated fee.   
              (3)  
    Shares of Class D common stock are only being offered pursuant to a private offering. 
     The selling commissions and dealer manager fees are offering costs and are recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital.  
  Stock Transactions 
  The stock transactions for each of our classes of common stock for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

15 

Stock Issuances 
  The stock issuances for our classes of shares, including those issued through our distribution reinvestment plan, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were as follows:  

Share Repurchase Plan 
  Our share repurchase plan allows stockholders, subject to a one-year holding period, with certain exceptions, to request that we repurchase all or a portion of their shares on a daily basis at that day's NAV per share, limited to   5%   of aggregate Company NAV per quarter. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   3,891,955   shares of common stock. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we repurchased   2,151,327   shares of common stock.  
  Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
  Pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, holders of shares of any class of our common stock may elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock at the NAV per share applicable to the class of shares being purchased on the distribution date.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued   1,788,411   shares of common stock for   $20,073   under the distribution reinvestment plan. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we issued   810,772   shares of common stock for $  8,792   under the distribution reinvestment plan. 
  Earnings Per Share ( EPS ) 
  Basic per share amounts are based on the weighted average of shares outstanding of   113,935,929   and   99,933,097   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   63,528,103   and   55,849,531   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. We have no dilutive or potentially dilutive securities.   
  Organization and Offering Costs 
  Organization and offering costs include, but are not limited to, legal, accounting and printing fees and personnel costs of our Advisor (including reimbursement of personnel costs for our executive officers prior to the commencement of the offerings) attributable to our organization, preparation of the registration statement, registration and qualification of our common stock for sale with the SEC and in the various states and filing fees incurred by our Advisor. LaSalle agreed to fund our organization and offering expenses through January 16, 2015, which is the date the SEC declared our registration statement effective for the First Extended Public Offering, following which time we commenced reimbursing LaSalle over   36   months for organization and offering costs incurred prior to the commencement date of the First Extended Public Offering.  Following the First Extended Public Offering commencement date, we began paying directly or reimbursing LaSalle if it pays on our behalf any organization and offering costs incurred during the First Extended Public Offering period (other than selling commissions and dealer manager fees) as and when incurred. After the termination of the First Extended Public Offering, our Advisor has agreed to reimburse us to the extent that the organization and offering costs that we incur exceed   15%   of our gross proceeds from the First Extended Public Offering. Organization costs are expensed, whereas offering costs are recorded as a reduction of capital in excess of par value. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , LaSalle had paid $  1,980   and $  2,009  , respectively, of organization and offering costs on our behalf which we had not yet been reimbursed. These costs are included in Accrued offering costs.

NOTE 7 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  Effective as of October 1, 2012, we entered into a first amended and restated advisory agreement with LaSalle, pursuant to which we pay a fixed advisory fee of   1.25%   of our NAV calculated daily.  The Advisory Agreement allows for a performance fee to be earned for each share class based on the total return of that share class during the calendar year.  The performance fee is calculated as   10%   of the return in excess of   7%   per annum.  On May 10, 2016, we renewed our Advisory Agreement with our Advisor for a one year term expiring on June 5, 2017. 
  The fixed advisory fees for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $4,030   and   $10,487  , respectively.  The fixed advisory fees for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   were   $2,195   and   $5,650  .  There were no performance fees for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The performance fees for both the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   were   $895  . Included in Advisor fees payable at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $1,377   and   $3,241   of fixed advisory fee and performance fee expenses, respectively.  
  We pay Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc. ( JLL Americas ), an affiliate of our Advisor, for property management, leasing, mortgage brokerage and sales brokerage services performed at various properties we own, on terms no less favorable than we could receive from other third party service providers.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , JLL Americas was paid   $105   and   $285  , respectively, for property management and leasing services.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , JLL Americas was paid   $139   and   $321  , respectively, for property management and leasing services.

  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we owed $  1,980   and $  2,009  , respectively, for organization and offering costs paid by LaSalle (see    Note 6-Common Stock   ). These costs are included in Accrued offering costs.  
   
  NOTE 8 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  We are involved in various claims and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve claims for damages. Many of these matters are covered by insurance, although they may nevertheless be subject to deductibles or retentions. Although the ultimate liability for these matters cannot be determined, based upon information currently available, we believe the ultimate resolution of such claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
  From time to time, we have entered into contingent agreements for the acquisition and financing of properties.  Such acquisitions and financings are subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence or meeting certain leasing or occupancy thresholds.   
  We were subject to fixed ground lease payments on South Beach Parking Garage of   $94   per year until September 30, 2016.  The fixed amount increased on September 30, 2016 to   $100   and will increase every five years thereafter by the lesser of 12% or the cumulative CPI over the previous five year period.  We are also subject to a variable ground lease payment calculated as 2.5% of revenue.  The lease expires September 30, 2041 and has a ten-year renewal option. 
  The operating agreement for Townlake of Coppell allows the unrelated third party joint venture partner, owning a 10% interest, to put their interest to us at a market determined value for a period of 90 days beginning in 2018.    
   
  NOTE 9 SEGMENT REPORTING  
  We have five operating segments: apartment, industrial, office, retail and other properties. Consistent with how we review and manage our properties, the financial information summarized below is presented by operating segment and reconciled to net income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

  NOTE 11  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
  In     May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   that will use a five step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts in an effort to increase consistency and comparability throughout global capital markets and across industries.  The model will identify the contract, identify any separate performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price and recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.  The new standard will replace most existing revenue recognition in GAAP when it becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance and have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-01   Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . The new standard requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The standard will become effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-02   Leases   (ASC 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.  The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.  Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today.  The update is expected to impact our consolidated financial statements as we have certain operating and land lease arrangements for which we are the lessee. ASC 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840   Leases.   The standard is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-15   Statement of Cash Flows   (Topic 230). The new guidance is intended to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The core principle of the standard requires the classification of eight specific issues identified under ASC 230 to be presented as either financing, investing or operating, or some combination thereof, depending upon the nature of the issue. The standard will be effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a retrospective transition approach for all of the issues identified to each period presented. We have not yet evaluated and cannot determine the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
   
        NOTE 12 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
  On October 13, 2016, we entered into a   $37,000   mortgage note payable on Lane Parke Apartments.  The mortgage note is for ten years and bears interest at a fixed rate of   3.18%  . 
  As of November 14, 2016, we had repaid the   $100,000   outstanding line of credit balance we had at September 30, 2016 using proceeds from our offering and the   $37,000   mortgage note payable on Lane Parke Apartments.

  Discussions surrounding our Unconsolidated Properties refer to properties owned through joint venture arrangements or condominium interests, which were comprised of the Chicago Parking Garage, the NYC Retail Portfolio and Pioneer Tower (office) as of   September 30, 2016  . Our investment in the NYC Retail Portfolio was acquired on December 8, 2015. We elected the fair value option to account for this investment.  Our investment in Pioneer Tower was acquired on June 28, 2016. 
  Our primary business is the ownership and management of a diversified portfolio of apartment, industrial, office, retail and other properties primarily located in the United States. It is expected that over time our real estate portfolio will be further diversified on a global basis and will be complemented by investments in real estate-related assets.  
  We are managed by our Advisor, LaSalle Investment Management, Inc., a subsidiary of our Sponsor, Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE: JLL), a leading global financial and professional services firm that specializes in commercial real estate. We hire property management and leasing companies to provide the on-site, day-to-day management and leasing services for our properties. When selecting a property management or leasing company for one of our properties, we look for service providers that have a strong local market or industry presence, create portfolio efficiencies, have the ability to develop new business for us and will provide a strong internal control environment that will comply with our Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002  
  
   24 

( Sarbanes-Oxley ) internal control requirements. We currently use a mix of property management and leasing service providers that include large national real estate service firms, including an affiliate of our Advisor and smaller local firms. 
  We seek to minimize risk and maintain stability of income and principal value through broad diversification across property sectors and geographic markets and by balancing tenant lease expirations and debt maturities across the real estate portfolio. Our diversification goals also take into account investing in sectors or regions we believe will create returns consistent with our investment objectives. Under normal conditions, we intend to pursue investments principally in well-located, well-leased properties within the apartment, industrial, office, retail and other sectors. We expect to actively manage the mix of properties and markets over time in response to changing operating fundamentals within each property sector and to changing economies and real estate markets in the geographic areas considered for investment. When consistent with our investment objectives, we also seek to maximize the tax efficiency of our investments through like-kind exchanges and other tax planning strategies. 
  The following charts summarize our portfolio diversification by property sector and geographic region based upon the fair value of our properties. These tables provide examples of how our Advisor evaluates our real estate portfolio when making investment decisions.

Our investments are not materially impacted by seasonality, despite certain of our retail tenants being impacted by seasonality. Percentage rents (rents computed as a percentage of tenant sales) that we earn from investments in retail properties may, in the future, be impacted by seasonality. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. For example, significant estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to the useful lives of assets, recoverable amounts of receivables, fair value of derivatives and real estate assets, initial valuations and related amortization periods of deferred costs and intangibles, particularly with respect to property acquisitions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  This MD A is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the only change to our critical accounting policies is that the accounting treatment for dealer manager fees is no longer considered a policy election and requires full accrual of all future dealer manager fees on the date of sale of a share of common stock.  We believe there have been no other significant changes during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates under  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Initial Valuations and Estimated Useful Lives or Amortization Periods for Real Estate Investments and Intangibles  
  These estimates are particularly important as they are used for the allocation of purchase price between depreciable and non-depreciable real estate and other identifiable intangibles, including above, below and at-market leases. As a result, the impact of these estimates on our operations could be substantial. Significant differences in annual depreciation or amortization expense may result from the differing useful life or amortization periods related to such purchased assets and liabilities.  
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  
  Our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is highly subjective and based on, among other things, our estimates regarding future market conditions, rental rates, occupancy levels, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other tenant concessions, assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period, discount rates and the length of our anticipated holding period. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material.

Recent Events and Outlook  
  General Company and Market Commentary 
  On January 16, 2015, we commenced our First Extended Public Offering of up to $2,700,000 in any combination of Class A, Class M, Class A-I and Class M-I shares of common stock, consisting of up to $2,400,000 of shares in our primary offering and up to $300,000 of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, and our Initial Public Offering automatically terminated.  We intend to offer shares of our common stock on a continuous basis for an indefinite period of time by filing a new registration statement before the end of each offering period, subject to regulatory approval.

The Dealer Manager has agreed to distribute shares of our common stock in our First Extended Public Offering. We intend to primarily use the net proceeds from the offering, after we pay the fees and expenses attributable to the offerings and our operations, to (1) grow and further diversify our portfolio by making investments in accordance with our investment strategy and policies, (2) reduce borrowings and repay indebtedness incurred under various financing instruments and (3) fund repurchases of our shares under our share repurchase plan.

  As of November 14, 2016, we had repaid the $100,000 outstanding line of credit balance we had at September 30, 2016 using proceeds from our offering and the $37,000 mortgage note payable on Lane Parke Apartments. 
  Investment Objectives and Strategy 
  Our primary investment objectives are: 
             
    to generate an attractive level of current income for distribution to our stockholders; 
                
    to preserve and protect our stockholders' capital investments; 
     
   30 

to achieve appreciation of our NAV over time; and 
                
    to enable stockholders to utilize real estate as an asset class in diversified, long-term investment portfolios. 
     The cornerstone of our investment strategy is to acquire and manage income-producing commercial real estate properties and real estate-related assets around the world. We believe this strategy enables us to provide our stockholders with a portfolio that is well-diversified across property type, geographic region and industry, both in the United States and internationally. It is our belief that adding international investments to our portfolio over time will serve as an effective tool to construct a well-diversified portfolio designed to provide our stockholders with stable distributions and attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns. 
  We believe that our broadly diversified portfolio benefits our stockholders by providing: 
             
    diversification of sources of income; 
                
    access to attractive real estate opportunities currently in the United States and, over time, around the world; and 
                
    exposure to a return profile that should have lower correlations with other investments. Since real estate markets are often cyclical in nature, our strategy allows us to more effectively deploy capital into property types and geographic regions where the underlying investment fundamentals are relatively strong or strengthening and away from those property types and geographic regions where such fundamentals are relatively weak or weakening. We intend to meet our investment objectives by selecting investments across multiple property types and geographic regions to achieve portfolio stability, diversification, current income and favorable risk-adjusted returns. To a lesser degree, we also intend to invest in debt and equity interests backed principally by real estate, which we refer to collectively as  real estate-related assets.  
     Our board of directors has adopted investment guidelines for our Advisor to implement and actively monitor in order to allow us to achieve and maintain diversification in our overall investment portfolio. Our board of directors formally reviews our investment guidelines on an annual basis and our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis or, in each case, more often as they deem appropriate. Our board of directors reviews the investment guidelines to ensure that the guidelines are being followed and are in the best interests of our stockholders. 
  We seek to invest: 
             
    up to 95% of our assets in properties; 
                
    up to 25% of our assets in real estate-related assets; and 
                
    up to 15% of our assets in cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments. 
     Notwithstanding the above, the actual percentage of our portfolio that is invested in each investment type may from time to time be outside these target levels due to numerous factors including, but not limited to, large inflows of capital over a short period of time, lack of attractive investment opportunities or increases in anticipated cash requirements for repurchase requests.  
  We expect to maintain a targeted Company leverage ratio (calculated as our share of total liabilities divided by our share of the fair value of total assets) of between 30% and 50%.  We intend to use low leverage, or in some cases possibly no leverage, to finance new acquisitions in order to maintain our targeted Company leverage ratio. Our Company leverage ratio was   39%   as of   September 30, 2016  .   
  2016 Key Initiatives 
  During 2016, we intend to use capital raised from our public and private offerings to make new acquisitions that will further our investment objectives and are in keeping with our investment strategy.  Likely acquisition candidates may include well-located industrial warehouses, grocery-anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers, urban infill retail and conventional apartments in either urban and transit-oriented locations or suburban, supply-constrained markets with highly-rated school districts.  We will look to acquire other property types when the opportunities and risk profile match our investment objectives and strategy.  We will also attempt to further our geographic diversification.  We will use debt financing to take advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment, while looking to keep the Company leverage ratio in the 30% to 50% range in the near term.  We also intend to use our revolving line of credit to allow us to more efficiently manage our cash flows.

Results of Operations 
  General  
  Our revenues are primarily received from tenants in the form of fixed minimum base rents and recoveries of operating expenses. Our expenses primarily relate to the costs of operating and financing the properties. Our share of the net income or net loss from our unconsolidated real estate affiliates is included in the equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates. We believe the following analysis of reportable segments provides important information about the operating results of our real estate investments, such as trends in total revenues or operating expenses that may not be as apparent in a period-over-period comparison of the entire Company.  We group our investments in real estate assets from continuing operations into five reportable operating segments based on the type of property, which are apartment, industrial, office, retail and other.  Operations from corporate level items and real estate assets sold are excluded from reportable segments.  
  Properties acquired or sold during any of the periods presented are presented within the recent acquisitions and sold properties line until the property has been owned for all periods presented. The properties currently presented within the recent acquisitions and sold properties line include the properties listed as either acquired or sold in the Management Overview section above. Properties owned for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are referred to as our comparable properties.  
  Results of Operations for the   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015     
  Revenues 
  The following chart sets forth revenues by reportable segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  :   

  Minimum rents at comparable properties increased by   $61   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase is primarily due to increases of $265 at 111 Sutter Street related to increased rental rates during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015.  Additionally, there was an increase of $168 at Monument IV at Worldgate as a result of Amazon executing a new lease late last year.  Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $332 at Rancho Temecula Town Center primarily related to the acceleration of a below-market in-place lease liability during the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of a tenant bankruptcy.  
  
   32 

Tenant recoveries relate mainly to real estate taxes and certain property operating expenses that are paid by us and are recoverable under the various tenants  leases. Other rental income includes daily transient parking, percentage rents and other non-recurring tenant charges. Tenant recoveries and other rental income at comparable properties increased by   $34   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase is related to higher recoveries of $156 at The District at Howell Mill due to higher real estate tax expense during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $51 at our Sherman Way properties related to lower repairs and maintenance and parking garage expenses during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , as well as a decrease of $47 in parking revenue at South Beach Parking Garage due to a lower volume of daily pay parkers.  
  Operating Expenses 
  The following chart sets forth real estate taxes, property operating expenses and provisions for (recovery of) doubtful accounts by reportable segment, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

33 

Real estate taxes at comparable properties increased by   $43   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase is primarily the result of a tax refund of $156 received at The District at Howell Mill during the three months ended September 30, 2015 that did not occur in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Partially offsetting the increase are refunds received and lower tax reassessments during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   at Station Nine Apartments and South Beach Parking Garage. Our properties are reassessed periodically by the taxing authorities, which may result in increases or decreases in the real estates taxes that we owe.  Overall, we expect real estate taxes to increase over time; however, we utilize real estate tax consultants to attempt to control assessment increases.  
  Property operating expenses consist of the costs of ownership and operation of the real estate investments, many of which are recoverable under net leases.  Examples of property operating expenses include insurance, utilities and repair and maintenance expenses.  Property operating expenses at comparable properties decreased   $114   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015.  The decrease is primarily related to a decrease of $106 at 111 Sutter Street due to lower repairs and maintenance as well as a decrease of $56 at our Sherman Way properties related to lower repairs and maintenance and parking garage expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of $44 at South Beach Parking Garage related to higher repairs and maintenance during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  Net provision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts relates to receivables deemed potentially uncollectable due to the age of the receivable or the status of the tenant. Provision for doubtful accounts at comparable properties increased by   $6   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015. Our total provision for doubtful accounts continus to be a minimal percentage of total revenues when comparing the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to the same period in 2015. 
  The following chart sets forth expenses not directly related to the operations of the reportable segments for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  :   

  Property general and administrative expenses relate mainly to property expenses unrelated to the operations of the property. Property general and administrative expenses increased   $60   primarily due to new properties acquired during 2015 and 2016. 
  Advisor fees relate to the fixed advisory and performance fees earned by the Advisor. Fixed fees increase or decrease based on changes in our NAV which will be primarily impacted by changes in capital raised and the value of our properties. The performance fee is accrued when the total return per share for a share class exceeds 7% for that calendar year, wherein our Advisor will receive 10% of the excess total return above the 7% threshold.  The increase in advisor fees of   $940   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period of 2015 is related to the increase in our net asset value attributable to capital raised over the past year. 
  Company level expenses relate mainly to our compliance and administration related costs. Company level expenses increased   $189   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to an increase in stockholder servicing costs and other professional service fees. 
  Acquisition expenses relate to expenses incurred during the acquisition of a property. Acquisition expenses increased   $1,277   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015  .  The properties acquired during both periods are listed above in the management overview and properties sections.  
  
   34 

The provision for impairment of real estate relates to real estate investments whose estimated future undiscounted cash flows have decreased below the carrying value of the property. A provision for impairment of real estate is recorded to write the property down from its carrying value to its fair value. Provision for impairment of real estate at   September 30, 2016   is due to impairment charges of   $6,355   at Railway Street Corporate Centre as we shortened the expected holding period for the investment because we consider it a non-strategic investment. The impairment charges had no impact on our NAV as we had previously written the property down to its fair value for purposes of our NAV calculation. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense is impacted by the values assigned to buildings, personal property and in-place lease assets as part of the initial purchase price allocation. The increase of   $2,213   in depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily related to an increase of $3,686 for our acquisitions that occurred in 2015 and 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $845 at 111 Sutter Street related to intangible assets that were fully depreciated at the end of 2015 and $449 related to the sale of 36 Research Park Drive and Campus Lodge Tampa during the current year. 
  Interest expense increased by   $1,106   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of new debt on the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions, new debt on Monument IV at Worldgate as well as our increased use of our line of credit. 
  Equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates relates to the income from Chicago Parking Garage and Pioneer Tower as well changes in fair value received and operating distributions received from our investment in the NYC Retail Portfolio. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   we recorded a   $3,638   increase in the fair value of and received a $1,125 operating distribution from our investment in the NYC Retail Portfolio. 
  Gain on disposition of property and extinguishment of debt of   $1,664   is related to the disposition of Campus Lodge Tampa during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
   
  Results of Operations for the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  Revenues 
  The following chart sets forth revenues by reportable segment, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  :   

35 

Minimum rents at comparable properties increased by   $892   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase is primarily due to increases of $931 at 111 Sutter Street related to increased rental rates during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Additionally, there was an increase of $384 at Monument IV at Worldgate as a result of Amazon executing a new lease late last year.  Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $422 at Rancho Temecula Town Center primarily related to the acceleration of a below-market in-place lease liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as as a result of a tenant bankruptcy.   
  Tenant recoveries relate mainly to real estate taxes and certain property operating expenses that are paid by us and are recoverable under the various tenants  leases. Other rental income includes daily transient parking, percentage rents and other non-recurring tenant charges. Tenant recoveries and other rental income at comparable properties increased by   $170   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase is primarily related to higher recoveries of  $239 at Rancho Temecula Town Center and $118 at The District at Howell Mill related to higher real estate taxes and higher operating expenses. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $209 in parking revenue at South Beach Parking Garage due to a lower volume of daily pay parkers during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  Operating Expenses 
  The following chart sets forth real estate taxes, property operating expenses and provisions for doubtful accounts by reportable segment, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  :

Real estate taxes at comparable properties decreased by   $66   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . The decrease is primarily related to a decrease of $70 at Station Nine Apartments and $66 at our Sherman Way properties related to lower tax reassessments during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Additionally, there was a decrease of $63 at South Beach Parking Garage related to a refund for 2015 taxes received during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Partially offsetting the decreases are higher tax reassessments during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   at some of our Retail properties. Our properties are reassessed periodically by the taxing authorities which may result in increases or decreases in real estates taxes that we owe. Overall, we expect real estate taxes to increase over time; however, we utilize real estate tax consultants to attempt to control assessment increases.  
  Property operating expenses consist of the costs of ownership and operation of the real estate investments, many of which are recoverable under net leases. Examples of property operating expenses include insurance, utilities and repair and maintenance expenses. Property operating expenses at comparable properties increased   $120   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period of   2015  . The increase is primarily related to an increase of $118 at Station Nine Apartments due to higher repairs and maintenance expense for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  
  Net provision for doubtful accounts relates to receivables deemed potentially uncollectible due to the age of the receivable or the status of the tenant. Provision for doubtful accounts decreased by   $25   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period of   2015  , primarily related to lower bad debts of $39 at The District at Howell Mill and of $36 at Rancho Temecula Town Center related to tenant charges reserved during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
  The following chart sets forth expenses not directly related to the operations of the reportable segments for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  :      

  Property general and administrative expenses relate mainly to property expenses unrelated to the operations of the property. Property general and administrative expenses increased   $298   primarily due to properties acquired during 2015 and 2016.  
  Advisor fees relate to the fixed advisory and performance fees earned by the Advisor. Fixed fees increase or decrease based on changes in our NAV which will be primarily impacted by changes in capital raised and the value of our properties.  The performance fee is accrued when the total return per share for a share class exceeds 7% for that calendar year, where in our Advisor will receive 10% of the excess total return above the 7% threshold.  The increase in advisor fees of   $3,942   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period of   2015   is related to the increase in our net asset value attributable to capital raised over the past year.  
  Company level expenses relate mainly to our compliance and administration related costs. Company level expenses increased   $47   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to an increase in stockholder servicing costs and other professional service fees. 
  Acquisition expenses relate to expenses incurred during the acquisition of a property. Acquisition expenses increased   $1,726   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015  . The properties acquired during both periods are listed above in the management overview and properties sections.

The provision for impairment of real estate relates to real estate investments whose estimated future undiscounted cash flows have decreased below the carrying value of the property. A provision for impairment of real estate is recorded to write the property down from its carrying value to its fair value. Provision for impairment of real estate at   September 30, 2016   is due to impairment charges of   $6,355   at Railway Street Corporate Centre as we shortened the expected holding period for the investment because we consider it a non-strategic investment. The impairment charges had no impact on our NAV as we had previously written the property down to its fair value for purposes of our NAV calculation. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense is impacted by the values assigned to buildings, personal property and in-place lease assets as part of the initial purchase price allocation. The increase of   $7,045   in depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily related to an increase of $10,258 related to our acquisitions that occurred in 2015 and 2016. These increases was partially offset by decreases of $2,573 at 111 Sutter Street related to intangible assets that were fully depreciated at the end of 2015 and $591 related to the sale of 36 Research Park Drive and Campus Lodge Tampa during the current year. 
  Interest expense increased by   $5,375   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   as a result of new debt on our 2015 and 2016 acquisitions, and new debt on Monument IV at Worldgate as well as our increased use of our line of credit to acquire properties in 2016. 
  Equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates relates to the income from Chicago Parking Garage and Pioneer Tower as well as changes in fair value received and operating distributions received from our investment in the NYC Retail Portfolio. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a   $4,014   increase in the fair value of and received a $1,125 operating distribution from our investment in the NYC Retail Portfolio. 
  Gain on disposition of property and extinguishment of debt of   $1,704   is related to the disposition of 36 Research Park Drive and Campus Lodge Tampa during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . During the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the gain on disposition of property and extinguishment of debt of   $29,009   is related to the disposition of four student-oriented apartment properties as well as the payoff of a mortgage note payable. 
   
   Funds From Operations 
  Consistent with real estate industry and investment community preferences, we consider funds from operations ("FFO") as a supplemental measure of the operating performance for a real estate investment trust and a complement to GAAP measures because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of our properties. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as net income (loss) attributable to the Company (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from cumulative effects of accounting changes, extraordinary items, impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and sales of properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for these items related to noncontrolling interests and unconsolidated affiliates. 
  FFO does not give effect to real estate depreciation and amortization because these amounts are computed to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Because values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, we believe that FFO provides investors with an additional view of our operating performance.  We also use Adjusted FFO ("AFFO") as a supplemental measure of operating performance.  We define AFFO as FFO adjusted for straight-line rental income, amortization of above- and below-market leases, amortization of net discount on assumed debt, gains or losses on the extinguishment and modification of debt, performance fees based on the investment returns on shares of our common stock and acquisition costs. 
  In order to provide a better understanding of the relationship between FFO, AFFO and GAAP net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial reporting measure, we have provided reconciliations of GAAP net income attributable to Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust, Inc. to FFO, and FFO to AFFO. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of the Company's ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to more comprehensively understand its operating performance, FFO and AFFO should be considered along with its reported net income attributable to Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust, Inc. and its cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.  Our presentations of FFO and AFFO are not necessarily comparable to the similarly titled measures of other REITs due to the fact that not all REITs use the same definitions.

The following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP net income to NAREIT FFO for the periods presented: 

(1) 
    Excludes amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests and includes our ownership share of both consolidated properties and unconsolidated real estate affiliates. 
     We believe AFFO is useful to investors because it provides supplemental information regarding the performance of our portfolio over time.

NAV as of   September 30, 2016    
  The following table provides a breakdown of the major components of our NAV as of   September 30, 2016  : 

The following table provides a breakdown of the major components of our NAV as of   December 31, 2015  : 

The increase in NAV per share from December 31, 2015 to   September 30, 2016  , was related to a net increase of 0.7% in the value of our portfolio.  Property operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   had an insignificant impact on NAV as dividends declared offset property operations for the period.  Our NAV for the different share classes is reduced by normal and recurring class-specific fees and offering and organization costs. 
  The following are key assumptions (shown on a weighted-average basis) that are used in the discounted cash flow models to estimate the value of our real estate investments as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    Other includes two standalone parking garages.  South Beach Parking Garage is subject to a ground lease and the appraisal incorporates discounted cash flows over its remaining lease term.

The following are key assumptions (shown on a weighted-average basis) that are used in the discounted cash flow models to estimate the value of our real estate investments as of   December 31, 2015  : 

(1) 
    Other includes two standalone parking garages.  South Beach Parking Garage is subject to a ground lease and the appraisal incorporates discounted cash flows over its remaining lease term. 
     While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, a change in these assumptions would impact the calculation of the value of our real estate investments. For example, assuming all other factors remain unchanged, an increase in the weighted-average discount rate/internal rate of return ("IRR") used as of   September 30, 2016   of 0.25% would yield a decrease in our total real estate investment value of 1.26% and our NAV per share class would have been $10.99, $11.02, $11.03, $11.02 and $11.01 for Class A, Class M, Class A-I, Class M-I and Class D, respectively. An increase in the weighted-average discount rate/IRR used as of   December 31, 2015   of 0.25% would yield a decrease in our total real estate investment value of 1.2% and our NAV per each share class would have been $10.96, $10.98, $10.99, $10.98 and $10.97 for Class A, Class M, Class A-I, Class M-I and Class D, respectively. 
  Limitations and Risks 
  As with any valuation methodology, our methodology is based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different NAV per share. Accordingly, with respect to our NAV per share, we can provide no assurance that: 
             
    a stockholder would be able to realize this NAV per share upon attempting to resell his or her shares; 
                
    we would be able to achieve for our stockholders the NAV per share upon a listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange, selling our real estate portfolio or merging with another company; or 
                
    the NAV per share, or the methodologies relied upon to estimate the NAV per share, will be found by any regulatory authority to comply with any regulatory requirements. 
     Furthermore, the NAV per share was calculated as of a particular point in time. The NAV per share will fluctuate over time in response to, among other things, changes in real estate market fundamentals, capital markets activities and attributes specific to the properties and leases within our portfolio.

The sources and uses of cash for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were as follows:   

  Cash provided by operating activities   increased     $10,772   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  Cash from operating activities increased   $7,008   primarily related to acquisitions of properties that occurred in 2015 and 2016. Also impacting our cash provided by operating activities are changes in our working capital, which include tenant accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, advisor fee payable and accounts payable and other accrued expenses. These changes in our working capital caused   an increase   to cash provided by operating activities of   $3,764   between the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the same period in   2015  , which was primarily related to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.  
  Cash used in investing activities   increased   by   $468,093   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase was primarily related to cash used to purchase new properties of   $265,595   and cash used  for investments in unconsolidated real estate affiliates of   $120,425  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we received cash in the amount of $121,694 from the sale of four student-oriented apartment properties as compared to $45,462 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the sales of 36 Research Park Drive and Campus Lodge Tampa.    
  
   42 

Cash provided by financing activities   increased   by   $401,883   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase primarily related to an increase in net   proceeds   from mortgage note payables and draws on our line of credit of   $251,932   received during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to net   proceeds   of   $13,366   during the same period in   2015  . Additionally, there is an increase of   $157,930   in net proceeds received from the sale of common stock during 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Also increasing cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was a   decrease   in distributions to noncontrolling interests of   $8,689   related to the sale of four student-oriented apartment properties in 2015.  
   
  Financing 
  We have relied primarily on fixed-rate financing, locking in what were favorable spreads between real estate income yields and mortgage interest rates and have tried to maintain a balanced schedule of debt maturities. We also use interest rate derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate movements on our variable rate debt. The following consolidated debt table provides information on the outstanding principal balances and the weighted average interest rates at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :   

Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments 
  From time to time, we have entered into contingent agreements for the acquisition and financing of properties.  Such acquisitions and financings are subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence or meeting certain leasing or occupancy thresholds.  
  We were subject to fixed ground lease payments on South Beach Parking Garage of   $94   per year until September 30, 2016.  The fixed amount increased on September 30, 2016 to   $100,000   and will increase every five years thereafter by the lesser of 12% or the cumulative CPI over the previous five year period.  We are also subject to a variable ground lease payment calculated as 2.5% of revenue.  The lease expires September 30, 2041 and has a ten-year renewal option. 
  The operating agreement for Townlake of Coppell allows the unrelated third party joint venture partner, owning a 10% interest, to put their interest to us at a market determined value for a period of 90 days beginning in 2018.    
  Other Sources 
  On January 16, 2015, our First Extended Public Offering registration statement was declared effective with the SEC (Commission File No. 333-196886) to register up to   $2,700,000   in any combination of shares of our Class A, Class M, Class A-I and Class M-I common stock, consisting of up to   $2,400,000   of shares offered in our primary offering and up to   $300,000   in shares offered pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We intend to offer shares of our common stock on a continuous basis for an indefinite period of time by filing a new registration statement before the end of each three-year offering period, subject to regulatory approval. We intend to use the net proceeds from the First Extended Public Offering, which are not used to pay the fees and other expenses attributable to our operations, to (1) grow and further diversify our portfolio by making investments in accordance with our investment strategy and policies, (2) reduce borrowings and repay indebtedness incurred under various financing instruments and (3) fund repurchases under our share repurchase plan.  
  On March 3, 2015, we commenced a private offering of up to $350,000 in shares of our Class D common stock with an indefinite duration. Proceeds from our private offering will be used for the same corporate purposes as the proceeds of our First Extended Public Offering.  We will reserve the right to terminate the Follow-on Private Offering at any time and to extend the Follow-on Private Offering term to the extent permissible under applicable law. 
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had approximately $150 in outstanding letters of credit, none of which are reflected as liabilities on our balance sheet. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements. 
  
   43 

Distributions to Stockholders 
  To remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must distribute or pay tax on 100% of our capital gains and distribute at least 90% of ordinary taxable income to stockholders. 
  The following factors, among others, will affect operating cash flow and, accordingly, influence the decisions of our board of directors regarding distributions: 
             
    scheduled increases in base rents of existing leases; 
                
    changes in minimum base rents and/or overage rents attributable to replacement of existing leases with new or renewal leases; 
                
    changes in occupancy rates at existing properties and procurement of leases for newly acquired or developed properties; 
                
    necessary capital improvement expenditures or debt repayments at existing properties; and 
                
    our share of distributions of operating cash flow generated by the unconsolidated real estate affiliates, less management costs and debt service on additional loans that have been or will be incurred. 
     We anticipate that operating cash flow, cash on hand, proceeds from dispositions of real estate investments or refinancings will provide adequate liquidity to conduct our operations, fund general and administrative expenses, fund operating costs and interest payments and allow distributions to our stockholders in accordance with the REIT qualification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
  In     May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   that will use a five step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts in an effort to increase consistency and comparability throughout global capital markets and across industries.  The model will identify the contract, identify any separate performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price and recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.  The new standard will replace most existing revenue recognition in GAAP when it becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance and have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-01   Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . The new standard requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The standard will become effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-02   Leases   (ASC 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.  The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.  Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today.  The update is expected to impact our consolidated financial statements as we have certain operating and land lease arrangements for which we are the lessee. ASC 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840   Leases.   The standard is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  
   44 

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-15   Statement of Cash Flows   (Topic 230). The new guidance is intended to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The core principle of the standard requires the classification of eight specific issues identified under ASC 230 to be presented as either financing, investing or operating, or some combination thereof, depending upon the nature of the issue. The standard will be effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a retrospective transition approach for all of the issues identified to each period presented. We have not yet evaluated and cannot determine the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
   
                 Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates in terms of our variable-rate debt and the price of new fixed-rate debt for refinancing of existing debt. We manage our interest rate risk exposure by obtaining fixed-rate loans where possible as well as by entering into interest rate cap and swap agreements. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had consolidated debt of $  743,939  , which included $  129,680   of variable-rate debt. Including the $  5,356   net debt premium on assumed debt and debt issuance costs, we have consolidated debt of $  738,583   at   September 30, 2016  . We also entered into interest rate cap and swap agreements on $89,080 of debt which cap the LIBOR rate at between 1.0% and 3.3% over the next year.  A 0.25% movement in the interest rate on the   $129,680   of variable-rate debt would have resulted in a   $324   annualized increase or decrease in consolidated interest expense and cash flow from operating activities. 
  We are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our fixed-rate financing in that changes in interest rates will impact the fair value of our fixed-rate financing. To determine fair market value, the fixed-rate debt is discounted at a rate based on an estimate of current lending rates, assuming the debt is outstanding through maturity and considering the collateral. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our mortgage notes payable was estimated to be $  12,867   higher than the carrying value of $  743,939  . If treasury rates were 0.25% higher at   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our mortgage notes payable would have been $  2,868   lower than the carrying value. 
  In August 2007, we purchased Railway Street Corporate Centre located in Calgary, Canada. For this investment, we use the Canadian dollar as the functional currency. When preparing consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date, while income and expense items are translated at weighted average rates for the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and foreign currency translation adjustment on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. 
  As a result of our Canadian investment, we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of our Canadian investment and transactions denominated in Canadian dollars. Our objective is to control our exposure to these risks through our normal operating activities. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we recognized a foreign currency translation gain of $458 and loss of $1,206, respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement would have caused our   $458   foreign currency translation gain to be decreased by   $595  , resulting in a foreign currency translation loss of   $137  .  
   
                 Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on management s evaluation as of   September 30, 2016  , our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
  OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings. 

We are involved in various claims and litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve claims for damages. Many of these matters are covered by insurance, although they may nevertheless be subject to deductibles or retentions. Although the ultimate liability for these matters cannot be determined, based upon information currently available, we believe the ultimate resolution of such claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The following risk factor hereby replaces the second risk factor on page 19 of Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016: 
    
  Changes in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in the application of accounting policies could adversely affect our financial results. 
    
  Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and our independent registered public accounting firm) may amend, clarify, interpret or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in the revision of prior period financial statements. Changes in accounting standards can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. 
   
                 Item 2. 
    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.  

ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
  Share Repurchase Plan 
  Our share repurchase plan limits repurchases during any calendar quarter to shares with an aggregate value (based on the repurchase price per share on the day the repurchase is effected) of 5% of the combined NAV of all classes of shares as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter, which means that in any 12-month period, we limit repurchases to approximately 20% of our total NAV. If the quarterly volume limitation is reached on or before the third business day of a calendar quarter, repurchase requests during the next quarter will be satisfied on a stockholder by stockholder basis, which we refer to as a  per stockholder allocation,  instead of a first-come, first-served basis. Pursuant to the per stockholder allocation, each of our stockholders would be allowed to request repurchase at any time during such quarter of a total number of shares not to exceed 5% of the shares of common stock the stockholder held as of the end of the prior quarter. The per stockholder allocation requirement will remain in effect for each succeeding quarter for which the total repurchases for the immediately preceding quarter exceeded four percent of our NAV on the last business day of such preceding quarter. If total repurchases during a quarter for which the per stockholder allocation applies are equal to or less than four percent of our NAV on the last business day of such preceding quarter, then repurchases will again be first-come, first-served for the next succeeding quarter and each quarter thereafter.  
  
   46 

During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased 716,365 shares of common stock under the share repurchase plan.    

  (1)     Redemptions are limited as described above.  
  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
  On March 3, 2015, we commenced the Follow-on Private Offering of up to   $350,000   in shares of our Class D common stock with an indefinite duration. On July 28, 2016, we received $766 related to the issuance of 68,069 of our Class D common stock at $11.26 per share pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. No selling commissions are paid on the sale of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.  On August 2, 2016, we sold 1,420,959 shares of our Class D common stock and raised $16,000 in proceeds under our Follow-on Private Offering which were used to increase our cash and cash equivalents. 
  These sales are exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and the purchaser is an accredited investor within the meaning of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.  LaSalle Investment Management Distributors, LLC serves as the dealer manager for the Follow-on Private Offering.
