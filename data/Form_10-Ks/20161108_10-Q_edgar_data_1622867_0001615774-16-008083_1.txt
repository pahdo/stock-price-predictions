COMPUTRON, INC  

  NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE 1   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

Computron Inc. (the  Company ) is a Nevada Corporation
incorporated on August 22, 2014. The Company plans to establish itself as an online computer support business. 

Basis of Presentation  

The Company maintains its accounting
records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
( U.S. GAAP ). These financial statements are presented in US dollars. 

Fiscal Year End  

The Corporation has adopted a fiscal year end of December 31. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Statements  

The interim financial statements of the Company as of September
30, 2016, and for the periods then ended, and cumulative from inception, are unaudited. However, in the opinion of management,
the interim financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present
fairly the Company's financial position as of September 30, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
periods ended September 30, 2016, and cumulative from inception. These results are not necessarily indicative of the results expected
for the calendar year ending December 31, 2016. The accompanying financial statements and notes thereto do not reflect all disclosures
required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Refer to the Company's audited financial statements
as of December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC, for additional information, including significant accounting policies. 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The principal accounting policies are
set out below, these policies have been consistently applied to the period presented, unless otherwise stated:  

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Going concern  

The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at September 30, 2016, the Company has an
accumulated deficit of $60,549 from operations and has not earned sufficient revenues to cover its operating costs. The
Company intends to fund future operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its
capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31, 2016. The ability of the
Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to
continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise
additional funds through public or private placement offerings. 

These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Cash and cash equivalents  

Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities
of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) up to $250,000. 

Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses  

Accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at amortized
cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid
and arise when the Company becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services. 

Earnings per Share  

The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC
260,  Earnings Per Share  ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS )
on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders
of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting
the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects
of all potential dilutive common shares, which comprise options granted to employees. As September 30, 2016, the Company had no
potentially dilutive shares. 

Income Taxes  

Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic
740,  Income Taxes.  Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. Valuation allowances for deferred
tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue when
all of the following have occurred: persuasive evidence of an agreement with the customer exists, delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the selling price is reasonably
assured. Revenue consists of computer services and technical support provided to customers. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based
on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that
would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between
market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on
either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. 

The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure
fair value: 

 - Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments; 

 - Level 2: Other significant observable inputs (including quoted
prices in active markets for similar instruments); 

 - Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs (including assumptions
in determining the fair value of certain investments). 

NOTE 3   OTHER RECEIVABLE  

During 2015, the Company issued common
stock for cash to various stockholders. Proceeds of $21,050 was transferred to the Company's attorney, who held the proceeds in
escrow. The proceeds were received in full by the company during February 2016.

5,000,000 shares of common stock to the director of the company at price of $0.0001 per share, for $500 cash.

13,665 shares of common stock to various stockholders at price of $0.15 per share, for $2,050 cash. 

NOTE 6   INCOME TAXES  

The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the six month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows (assuming a 15% effective tax rate): 

The Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the deferred
income tax assets for period ended September 30, 2016 because it is not presently known whether future taxable income will be sufficient
to utilize the loss carryforwards. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $60,549
in tax loss carryforwards that can be utilized future periods to reduce taxable income, and expire by the year 2036. 

The Company did not identify any material uncertain tax positions.
The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits. 

The federal income tax returns of the Company are subject to
examination by the IRS, generally for three years after they are filed.

management reviewed all material events through the date of this report and determined that there are no additional material subsequent

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This Management s Discussion and
Analysis includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial
performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like:  believe,   expect,   estimate, 
 anticipate,   intend,   project,   will,   should  and similar expressions,
or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements,
which apply only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. We undertake no obligation to
update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise.  

Our financial statements are stated in
United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. 

In this quarterly report, unless otherwise
specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to  common stock  refer to the
common shares in our capital stock. 

As used in this Quarterly Report, the terms
 we,   us,   Company,   our  and  Computron  mean Computron, Inc., unless otherwise
indicated. 

THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT
OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS AS A GOING CONCERN. 

Results of Operations   

Our results of operations are presented
below: 

Results of Operations for the Three
and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016.   

Revenue for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $0 and $1,235. 

General and administrative expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $16,933. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

As of September 30, 2016 we had $0 in cash
and cash equivalents, and $38,999 in total liabilities as compared to $4,712 in cash and cash equivalents, and $22,200 in total
liabilities as of December 31, 2015. 

We are dependent on our revenues for cash
flow, as we have minimized cash flow requirements through equity or debt financing.  However, as we intend to expand
operations, it is likely that we will require cash flow from financing in the future which could affect our ability to become cash
flow positive. 

For the nine months ending September
30, 2016 we earned net cash of $(25,088) in operating activities. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We have no significant off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Inflation   

The amounts presented in the financial
statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The net operating losses shown would
be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement
costs or by using other inflation adjustments. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures   

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As required by Rule 13a-15(e), our management
has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of David Breier our President and Principal Accounting
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of June 30, 2016. Based
upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, David Breier determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting   

During the fiscal quarter ended June 30,
2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may become involved
in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business. We are currently
not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse affect on
our business, financial condition or operating results.
