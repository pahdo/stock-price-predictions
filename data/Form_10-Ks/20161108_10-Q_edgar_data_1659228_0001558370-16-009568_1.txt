Bats Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

(1)  Organization and Basis of Presentation   

Bats Global Markets, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the Company or Bats) is a global financial technology company that provides trade execution, market data, trade reporting, connectivity and risk management solutions to brokers, market makers, asset managers and other market participants, ultimately benefiting retail and institutional investors across multiple asset classes. The Company s asset classes comprise listed cash equity securities in the United States (U.S.) and Europe, listed equity options in the United States, and institutional spot foreign currency (FX) globally. The Company is headquartered in the Kansas City, Missouri, area with additional offices in New York, New York, Chicago, Illinois, San Francisco, California, London, United Kingdom (U.K.), Singapore and Quito, Ecuador. 

In September 2016, the Company announced that it has entered into a merger agreement with CBOE Holdings, Inc. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for the interim periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Accordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible change in the near team include the receivable from market data fees, the valuation of goodwill and unrecognized tax benefits. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Initial Public Offering and Stock Split 

On April 20, 2016, in connection with the closing of the Company s initial public offering (IPO) in which certain stockholders of the Company sold 15,295,000 shares of existing common stock at a public offering price of $19.00 per share, the Company effected a stock split at a ratio of 1-for-2.91 of each share of the Company s outstanding common stock and non-voting common stock, after giving effect to the reclassification of each share of Class A non-voting common stock to voting common stock and Class B non-voting common stock to non-voting common stock.  All references to shares and per-share data in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis. 

Reclassifications 

Certain amounts in the prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  The Company had historically voluntarily disclosed transactions with all stockholders irrespective of beneficial ownership.  The condensed consolidated financial statements herein reflect related party transactions with only related persons, as defined by U.S. GAAP and Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities and Exchange Act (the  Exchange Act ). 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements, Adopted 

In the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03,   Interest Imputation of Interest,   which simplified the presentation of debt issuance cost by changing the classification of debt issuance cost from an asset to a contra-liability directly deducted from the face amount of the debt to which it relates.  All periods presented have conformed to this new classification, which resulted in a $9.9 million reclassification from total assets to total liabilities as of December 31, 2015.

Bats Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

In the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-17,   Income Taxes Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  . Deferred tax liabilities and assets are now classified as noncurrent on the consolidated statements of financial condition.  All periods presented have conformed to this new classification, which resulted in a $0.6 million reclassification from current deferred tax assets to deferred income taxes, net as of December 31, 2015. 

In the third quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  This ASU s purpose is to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions. Among other things, the ASU requires that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies associated with share-based compensation be recognized as income tax provision verses the current requirements to record the impact to additional paid-in capital or income tax provision, depending on circumstances.  The 2016 periods presented have conformed to this new classification. The change was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements and the Company continues to account for forfeitures on an actual basis. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements, Not yet Adopted 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which supersedes the revenue recognition guidance in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. The new revenue recognition standard sets forth a five-step revenue recognition model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures. The standard provides alternative methods of initial adoption and is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to January 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805)  . This standard simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. First, it requires that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer also should record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified after December 15, 2015 and that are within the measurement period. Upon transition, an entity would be required to disclose the nature of, and reason for, the change in accounting principle. An entity would provide that disclosure in the first annual period of adoption and in the interim periods within the first annual period. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02  , Leases, (Topic 842)  . The ASU will require organizations that lease assets referred to as   lessees   to recognize on the consolidated statement of financial condition the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,   Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323)  .  The ASU s purpose is to simplify the accounting for equity method investments by eliminating the requirement that an entity retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting if an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence. It now requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The update is effective for the Company for the annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue for Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations.   The update clarifies implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by further explaining that the entity is considered a principal if it controls the promised service before transferring it to the customer. This update is effective for the Company along with ASU 2014-09 for the annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2018. This update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In August   2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230).   This ASU will   make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for the Company for the annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2019.   The Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. 

(2)  Acquisitions  

ETF.com 

On April 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of ETF.com for $12.6 million in cash.  ETF.com is a provider of exchange traded fund (ETF) data, news and analysis, with approximately $3.0 million in annual revenue for 2015. The purchase price was allocated to goodwill ($8.5 million), intangible assets ($3.5 million) and working capital ($0.6 million) and is recorded in the U.S. Equities segment. 

Hotspot 

On March 13, 2015 (the Hotspot Acquisition Date), the Company completed the acquisition of Hotspot FX Holdings LLC (the Bats Hotspot Acquisition) for $365 million in cash and a contingent consideration liability estimated at $62.6 million. This acquisition represents further expansion into non-equity trading businesses for the Company. 

The results of Hotspot s operations have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements since the Hotspot Acquisition Date. 

The amounts of revenue and operating (loss) income of Hotspot are included in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of income from the Hotspot Acquisition Date to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and are as follows (in millions):

(8)    Debt  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the long-term debt consisted of the following (in millions): 

In June 2016, the Company refinanced its term loan with new seven-year $650 million term loan (the  2016 Term Facility ).  The 2016 Term Facility decreased the spread on the interest rate to, subject to compliance with a leverage ratio pricing grid, LIBOR plus 350 basis points, and includes 50 basis points of original issue discount. Under the 2016 Term Facility, the required annual amortization also decreased from 7.5% per annum to 1.0% per annum, calculated on the basis of the outstanding principal amount of the 2016 Term Facility. In addition to scheduled amortization payments, the Company may be required to make prepayments of principal based on a percentage of Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the 2016 Term Facility, or with 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain assets sales or debt incurrences. In addition, the Company entered into a new three-year $100 million revolving credit facility with an interest rate based on, subject to compliance with a leverage ratio grid, LIBOR plus 275 basis points, which includes an undrawn fee  ,    s  ubject to compliance with a leverage ratio grid, of 37.5 basis points, replacing the revolving credit facility under the Amended 2014 Loan. The impact of the amended terms on the present value of cash flows was greater than 10%; therefore, the amendment was accounted for as an extinguishment resulting in a loss of $17.6 million that was recorded in a separate line item within non-operating expenses in the condensed statement of income. 

The unamortized debt discount of $3.  1   million and debt issuance cost of $11.0 million will be amortized as part of interest expense, net through June 30, 2023, the maturity date of the term loan. The effective interest rate was 4.2% at September 30, 2016. 

The credit agreement for the term loan contains customary reporting requirements, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio measured each quarter through the term of the loan, as further described in the credit agreement. The financial covenant places restrictions concerning the Company s ability to declare dividends and obtain additional financing, and requires that any proceeds from the sale of assets first be used to pay down the term loan. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the credit arrangement for the term loan. 

The Company and certain subsidiaries have guaranteed the repayment of obligations under the credit agreement and have granted pledges of the shares of certain subsidiaries along with a security interest in certain other assets of the Company and certain subsidiaries as collateral. 

Interest expense recognized on the term loans and revolving loans is included in interest expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of income, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in millions):

(10)    Fair Value Measurement 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and sets out a fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Inputs are broadly defined as assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. The types of investments included in Level 1 include listed equities and listed derivatives. 

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. Investments that are generally included in this category include corporate bonds and loans, less liquid and restricted equity securities and certain over the counter derivatives. A significant adjustment to a Level 2 input could result in the Level 2 measurement becoming a Level 3 measurement. 

Level 3: Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the circumstances and the best information available at the time and may require significant management judgment or estimation. Investments that are included in this category generally include equity and debt positions in private companies. 

Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

The following table presents the Company s fair value hierarchy for those assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in millions):

The following is a description of the Company s valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

Available-for-sale and trading securities 

Financial investments classified as trading and available for sale consist of highly liquid U.S. Treasury securities. These securities are valued by obtaining feeds from a number of live data sources, including active market makers and inter dealer brokers and therefore categorized as Level 1. 

Contingent consideration liability 

The Company entered into a contingent consideration arrangement with the purchase of Hotspot from a related party on March 13, 2015. The fair value of this liability at September 30, 2016 was $61.0 million.  That value is based on estimates of discounted future cash payments, a significant unobservable input, and is considered a Level 3 measurement.  

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The following table presents the Company s fair value hierarchy for those financial instruments held by the Company as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in millions):

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable and Section 31 fees payable approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. 

Long-term debt 

The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates its fair value based on quoted LIBOR at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and is considered a Level 2 measurement. 

Information on Level 3 Financial Liabilities 

The following table sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

(11)    Segment Reporting 

The Company operates under four reportable segments: U.S. Equities, European Equities, U.S. Options and Global FX. Segment performance is primarily based on operating income (loss).

(14)    Regulatory Capital 

As a  broker dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Trading is subject to the SEC s Uniform Net Capital rule (Rule 15c3 1), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined. The SEC s requirement also provides that equity capital may not be withdrawn or a cash dividend paid if certain minimum net capital requirements are not met.

As entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), BTL is subject to the Financial Resource Requirement (FRR) and Chi-X Europe is subject to the Capital Resources Requirement (CRR). As a RIE, BTL computes its FRR in accordance with its Financial Risk Assessment, as agreed by the FCA. This FRR was $16.5 million at September 30, 2016 and $17.2 million at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, BTL had capital in excess of its required FRR of $24.3 million and $15.0 million, respectively. 

As a Banks, Investment firms, PRUdential (BIPRU) 50k firm as defined by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive of the FCA, Chi X Europe computes its CRR as the greater of the base requirement of $0.1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, or the summation of the credit risk, market risk and fixed overheads requirements, as defined. At both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Chi X Europe had capital in excess of its required CRR of $0.4 million.  

(15)    Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company utilizes equity award programs for offering long term incentives to its employees. The equity incentives have been granted in the form of nonstatutory stock options and restricted stock. In conjunction with these programs, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million and $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $6.1 million and $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,

Table of Contents

2016 and 2015, respectively. This expense is included in compensation and benefits in the condensed consolidated statements of income. 

There are four equity incentive plans pursuant to which stock options and restricted stock have been granted: the Bats Global Markets, Inc. 2009 Stock Option Plan (2009 Plan), the Third Amended and Restated Bats Global Markets, Inc. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (2012 Plan), the Bats Global Markets, Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (Omnibus Plan) and the Bats Global Markets, Inc. Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan (Directors Plan). Options and restricted stock granted under these plans generally vest over four years except for the Directors Plan, which generally vest over one year. Options granted under the 2009 Plan and 2012 Plan have ten year contractual terms. Pursuant to the 2009 Plan, 2012 Plan, Omnibus Plan and Directors Plan, the Company is authorized to grant restricted stock or stock options up to 6,388,663  ,   3,710,250  , 4,074,000 and 291,000 shares, respectively  .

The total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock is approximately $18.5 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average remaining period of 2.8 years. 

The Company purchased 11,718 treasury shares for $0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as the result of 31,393 shares of restricted stock vesting to satisfy the employee income tax withholdings upon exercise. 

(16)    Income Taxes  

The Company records income tax expense during interim periods based on the best estimate of the full year s tax rate as adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant interim period.  Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate and any change in the estimated rate is recorded on a cumulative basis.  The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 41.2% and 40.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    The increase in the three months ended September 30, 2016 against the comparable period in the prior year was due to an increase in non-deductible expenses and unrecognized tax benefits partially offset by a lower effective state tax rate.  The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 41.1% and 41.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The decrease was due to a lower overall effective state tax rate.

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time the Company is involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any of the reviews, inspections or other legal proceedings will have a material impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual litigated matters is not predictable with assurance. 

On April 18, 2014, the City of Providence, Rhode Island filed a securities class action lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Bats and Direct Edge, as well as 14 other securities exchanges. The action purports to be brought on behalf of all public investors who purchased and/or sold shares of stock in the United States between April 18, 2009 and the present on a registered public stock exchange (Exchange Defendants) or a United States-based alternate trading venue and were injured as a result of the misconduct detailed in the complaint, which includes allegations that the defendants

Table of Contents  

Bats Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

committed fraud through a variety of business practices associated with, among other things, what is commonly referred to as high frequency trading.  On May 2, 2014 and May 20, 2014, American European Insurance Company and Harel Insurance Co., Ltd. each filed substantially similar class action lawsuits against the Exchange Defendants which were ultimately consolidated with the City of Providence, Rhode Island securities class action lawsuit. On June 18, 2015, Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York held oral argument on the pending Motion to Dismiss and thereafter, on August 26, 2015, the Court issued an Opinion and Order granting Defendant s Motion to Dismiss, dismissing the Complaint in full. Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal of the dismissal on September 24, 2015 and its appeal brief on January 7, 2016.  Respondent s brief was filed on April 7, 2016 and oral argument was held on August 24, 2016. Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate what, if any, liability may result from this litigation. However, the Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to litigate the matter vigorously. 

On May 23, 2014 and May 30, 2014, Harold R. Lanier filed three class action lawsuits in the Southern District of New York against Bats and other securities exchanges.  The complaints were identical in all substantive respects, but each related to the dissemination of market data under a different market system   (i) the NASDAQ UTP Plan Market System; (ii) the OPRA Market System; and (iii) the Consolidated Quotation System and the Consolidated Tape System.  Each of the actions purported to be brought on behalf of all subscribers who entered into contracts with the exchanges for the receipt of market data and were injured as a result of the misconduct detailed in the complaints, which includes allegations that the defendants did not provide market data services in a non-discriminatory manner or provide subscribers with  valid  data (i.e., data that is accurate and not stale).  On January 16, 2015, Judge Katherine Forrest of the Southern District of New York held oral argument on the pending Motion to Dismiss and thereafter, on April 28, 2015, the Court filed an Opinion and Order granting the exchange defendants  Motion to Dismiss, terminating all three class action lawsuits with prejudice.  On May 20, 2015, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal of the dismissal and on September 1, 2015, Appellant filed its appeal brief. Respondent s brief was filed on November 24, 2015 and Appellant s reply brief was filed on December 8, 2015.  Oral argument was held on March 3, 2016.  On September 23, 2016, the Court filed a Judgment affirming the District Court s dismissal of all three class action lawsuits.  Appellant thereafter filed a petition for a rehearing before the panel or the entire appellate court on October 7, 2016.  Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate what, if any, liability may result from this litigation.  However, the Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to litigate the matter vigorously. 

Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) has filed a number of denial of access applications with the SEC to set aside proposed rule changes to establish or modify fees for Bats market data products and related services.  Each application is being held in abeyance pending a decision on a separate SIFMA denial of access application held before the SEC s Chief Administrative Law Judge, (ALJ), regarding fees proposed by Nasdaq and the NYSE for their respective market data products. On June 1, 2016, the ALJ issued a decision rejecting SIFMA s denial of access challenge to the Nasdaq and NYSE fees at issue, concluding that the exchanges do not enjoy monopoly pricing power over their depth of book feeds. On July 19, 2016, SIFMA petitioned the SEC for review of the ALJ decision.  An adverse ruling in that matter could cause the SEC to more closely examine exchange market data fees, which in turn could result in the Company having to reduce the fees it charges for market data. 

In addition, as a self-regulatory organization under the jurisdiction of the SEC, the Company is subject to routine reviews and inspections by the SEC, Bats Trading is subject to reviews and inspections by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ), and BTL and Chi-X Europe are subject to regulatory oversight in the United Kingdom by the FCA. The Company has from time to time received inquiries and investigative requests from the SEC s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations as well as the Division of Enforcement seeking information about the Company s compliance with the federal securities laws as well as the Company s members  compliance with the federal securities laws. 

(19)  Subsequent Events 

On November 2, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share on the Company s outstanding common stock, which is payable on December 13, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2016.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on April 15, 2016.  

Overview 

We are a leading global operator of securities exchanges and other electronic markets enabled by world-class technology. We provide trade execution, market data, trade reporting, connectivity and risk management solutions to brokers, market makers, asset managers and other market participants, ultimately benefiting retail and institutional investors across multiple asset classes. Our principal objective is to improve markets by maximizing efficiency and mitigating trade execution risk for market participants. Our asset class focus currently comprises listed cash equity securities in the United States and Europe, listed equity options in the United States and institutional spot FX globally, as well as ETPs, including ETFs, in the United States and Europe.  

On September 25, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with CBOE Holdings, Inc. (CBOE Holdings) under which CBOE Holdings agreed to acquire us in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $3.2 billion (based on the closing price of CBOE Holdings  common stock on September 23, 2016). The Merger Agreement also contains an election procedure allowing each of our stockholders to seek all cash or all stock, subject to proration and adjustment. The Merger Agreement has been approved by the board of directors of each company by unanimous votes. The transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2017. 

Business Segments  

We currently operate along four business segments. Our management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages our business according to these segments:  

U.S. Equities.     Our U.S. Equities segment includes listed cash equities and ETP transaction services that occur on BZX, BYX, EDGX and EDGA. It also includes the listed cash equities routed transaction services that occur on Trading and through January 12, 2015 routed transaction services that occurred on DE Route. It also includes the listings business where ETPs and the Company are listed on BZX and the recently acquired ETF.com. 

European Equities.     Our European Equities segment includes pan European listed equities transaction services, ETPs, exchange traded commodities, and international depository receipts that occur on our MTF, and a listing and trading venue on our RM, which together we refer to as Bats Europe. It also includes the listed cash equities and exchange-traded products routed transaction services that occur on Chi-X Europe, as well as the listings business where ETPs can be listed on BTL  . 

U.S. Options.     Our U.S. Options segment includes our listed equity options markets on BZX and EDGX. It also includes the listed equity options routed transaction services that occur on Trading  .   

Global FX.     Our Global FX segment includes institutional spot FX services that occur on the Hotspot Platform. The Company acquired Hotspot on March 13, 2015  .

Table of Contents  

March 2015: Acquired Hotspot FX Holdings, LLC in the  Bats Hotspot Acquisition  which included KCG Hotspot FX LLC, the operator of an electronic trading platform for institutional spot FX, or the Bats Hotspot Platform.     

September 2015: Launched the Bats Hotspot platform in London sucessfully.     

March 2016: Launched Bats T3P SPY Volatility Index successfully.     

April 2016: Acquired ETF.com, a provider of ETF data, news and analysis.     

June 2016: Refinanced our outstanding credit facility with a new seven-year $650 million term loan that decreased the spread on the interest rate to one-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points decreased the annual mandatory amortization to 1%, and includes 50 basis points of original issue discount. We also refinanced our revolving credit facility with a new three-year $100 million revolving credit facility.     

June 2016: Bats Europe launched a U.K.-focused benchmark index series successfully.     

September 2016: Signed an agreement to merge with CBOE Holdings, Inc.     

Factors Affecting Results of Operations  

In broad terms, our business performance is impacted by a number of drivers, including macroeconomic events affecting the risk and return of financial assets, investor sentiment, the regulatory environment for capital markets, geopolitical events, central bank policies and changing technology, particularly in the financial services industry. Our future revenues and net income will continue to be influenced by a number of domestic and international economic trends, including: 

trading volumes in listed cash equity securities and ETPs in both the U.S. and Europe, volumes in listed equity options and volumes in institutional spot FX trading, which are driven primarily by overall macroeconomic conditions;       

the demand for the U.S. tape plan market data distributed by the Securities Information Processor (SIP), which determines the pool size of the industry market data revenue we receive based on our market share;       

the demand for information about, or access to, our markets, which is dependent on the products we trade, our importance as a liquidity center and the quality and pricing of our data and access services;         

continuing pressure in transaction fee pricing due to intense competition in the United States and Europe;          

regulatory changes relating to market structure or affecting certain types of instruments, transactions, pricing structures, capital market participants or reporting or compliance requirements; and         

technological advances and members  demand for speed, efficiency and reliability.     

Currently our business drivers are defined by investors' and companies' cautiously optimistic outlook about the pace of global economic recovery. The U.S. and European listed cash equity securities markets have historically experienced growth in trading volumes. From time to time, however, volumes have declined due to economic performance, volatility and other related factors.  

23 

Table of Contents  

Recently, volumes in institution spot FX trading have been lower than expected when we purchased Bats Hotspot. If these trends continue, the future fair value of our goodwill related to that acquisition could be affected. Should this continue over an extended period of time, or should other events occur indicating the carrying value of the goodwill might be impaired, we would test the goodwill for impairment and recognize any impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.  We will continue to monitor institution spot FX trading volumes and other factors in order to determine if there are any indications of impairment prior to the planned annual impairment test in December. 

A number of significant structural, political and monetary issues continue to confront the global economy, instability could return at any time, resulting in an increased level of market volatility, oscillating trading volumes and a return of market uncertainty. In contrast, many of the largest customers of our transactional businesses continue to adapt their business models as they address the implementation of regulatory changes initiated following the global financial crisis.  

On June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted to leave the European Union (E.U.) in a referendum (the Brexit Vote).  At this stage, both the terms and the timing of the U.K.'s exit from the E.U. are unclear, and it is unlikely to be before the first quarter of 2019.  Moreover, the nature of the relationship of the U.K. with the remaining E.U. member states has yet to be discussed and negotiations with the E.U. on the terms of the exit have yet to commence.  This brings economic, market, with legal and regulatory uncertainties until the terms of the exit can be defined in the coming years. 

Financial Summary 

The following summarizes changes in financial performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

*    Not meaningful 

(1)  Organic net revenue is defined as revenues less cost of revenues excluding revenues less cost of revenues of any acquisition for the quarter the business was acquired and the following year comparable quarter. Organic net revenue does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to revenues less cost of revenues, or net revenue, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have presented organic net revenue because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and we use it as the basis for monitoring our own core operating financial performance relative to other operators of electronic exchanges. We also believe that it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. We believe that investors may find this non-GAAP measure useful in evaluating our performance compared to that of peer companies in our industry. Other companies may calculate organic net revenue differently than we do. Organic net revenue has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. 

The following is a reconciliation of revenues less cost of revenues to organic net revenue:

EBITDA is defined as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Normalized EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before acquisition-related costs, IPO costs, tax restructuring costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, debt restructuring costs and gain on extinguishment of revolving credit facility. EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered as, alternatives to net income or cash flows from operations, each as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have presented EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA because we consider them important supplemental measures of our performance and believe that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. In addition, we use Normalized EBITDA as a measure of operating performance for preparation of our forecasts, evaluating our leverage ratio for the debt to earnings covenant included in our

Adjusted earnings does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have presented Adjusted earnings because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and we use it as the basis for monitoring our own core operating financial performance relative to other operators of electronic exchanges. We also believe that it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. We believe that investors may find this non-GAAP measure useful in evaluating our performance compared to that of peer companies in our industry. Other companies may calculate Adjusted earnings differently than we do.

Transaction Fees  

Transaction fees decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily driven by our U.S. Equities segment.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the U.S. Equities segment transaction fees decreased $54.7 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to decreased market ADV of 6.6 billion shares for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an ADV of 7.3 billion shares for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decline of 9.6%. The U.S. Options segment contributed $8.5 million to the decrease, primarily driven by decreased market ADV of 15.1 million contracts in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 17.8 million contracts in the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decline of 15.2%. European Equities transaction fees decreased $6.3 million primarily driven by a 19.9% decrease in ADNV compared to the same period in 2015, and a decrease in the average exchange rate of the British pound to the U.S. dollar decreasing transaction fees by $3.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016.

This was offset by a decrease in industry market data fees from the U.S. tape plan due to a slight decrease in U.S. Equities market share from 21.7% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 to 20.8% in the same period in 2015. 

Market data fees increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to pricing changes in proprietary market data implemented in the third quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016 which contributed  $7.4 million, an audit recovery of $1.4 million received from the U.S. Tape Plan in the first quarter 2016 and increased U.S. Options market share from 9.9% in 2015 to 11.0% in 2016 contributing $0.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Connectivity Fees and Other  

Connectivity fees and other revenues increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to U.S. Options and Global FX pricing changes to logical ports in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2016 contributing $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, to revenues in the three

Table of Contents  

Revenues less cost of revenues increased in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a 118.5% increase in U.S. Options net capture contributing $2.9 million, pricing changes of U.S. Options and Global FX connectivity fees in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, respectively, contributing $2.3 million, and pricing changes to U.S. Equities proprietary market data in the first quarter of 2016 contributing $1.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016. These were offset by a 9.6% decrease in U.S. Equities market ADV, contributing $1.3 million to the decrease, and the decrease of the in the average exchange rate of the British pound to U.S. dollar, which decreased revenues less cost of revenues by $1.9 million.

Fluctuations in Revenues Less Cost of Revenues  

Fluctuations in revenues less cost of revenues are driven by various factors. Volume variances are driven by changes in overall industry volume and our share of those volumes, while net capture variances are driven primarily by pricing changes. The following table summarizes the fluctuations in revenues less cost of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, and attributes the fluctuations to various sources: 

Transaction Fees Less Liquidity Payments and Routing and Clearing Costs  

Transaction fees less liquidity payments and routing and clearing costs increased in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily driven by an increase in U.S. Options net capture from $0.027 per contract for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.059 per contract for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This was offset by a $1.9 million decrease due to the lower average exchange rate of the British pound to U.S. dollar, reflected in our European Equities segment, a $1.3 million decrease due to a 9.6% decrease in U.S. Equities market ADV and a $1.0 million decrease in our Global FX segment due to an 8.5% decrease in net capture. 

Transaction fees less liquidity payments and routing and clearing costs increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily driven by an increase in U.S. Options net capture from $0.024 per contract in 2015 to $0.053 per contract in 2016 that resulted in a $10.0 million increase to transaction fees less liquidity payments and routing and clearing costs. Also contributing to the increase was a 7.2% increase in U.S. Equities market ADV that contributed $4.3 million and Global FX revenue of $5.0 million due to the Bats Hotspot Acquisition in first quarter 2015.  Offsetting these increases was a $3.6 million decrease due to the decreased value of the British pound in 2016. 

Market Data Fees  

Market data fees increased in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to pricing changes in U.S. Equities proprietary market data that were implemented in the first quarter of 2016 which contributed $1.9 million to this increase. This was offset by a decrease in industry market data fees from the U.S. tape plan, due to a slight decrease in U.S. Equities market share from 21.7% in the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 20.8% in the same period in 2016. 

Market data fees increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to pricing changes in proprietary market data that were implemented in the third quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016 which contributed  $7.4 million, an audit recovery of $1.4 million received from the U.S. Tape Plan in the first quarter 2016 and increased U.S. Options market share from 9.9% in 2015 to 11.0% in 2016 contributing $0.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Connectivity Fees  

Connectivity fees and other revenues increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to U.S. Options and Global FX pricing changes to logical ports in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, respectively, contributing $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, to the three months ended September 30, 2016, and $2.9 million and $1.2 million to the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Operating Expenses  

Total operating expenses increased slightly in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, operating expenses increased 4.9%, primarily driven by increased professional fees related to the planned merger with CBOE Holdings and compensation and benefits due to an increased global headcount of 16.0% from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, operating expenses increased 1.4%, primarily driven by the Direct Edge acquisition synergies recognized in systems and data communication expenses offset by increased compensation and benefits expenses due to the Bats Hotspot acquisition in March 2015 and an increased global headcount of 16.0% from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. The following summarizes changes in operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 

Compensation and Benefits  

Compensation and benefits increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily driven by increased global headcount from 281 associates as of September 30, 2015 to 326 associates as of September 30, 2016, offset by the timing of quarterly milestone bonuses achieved in 2016 compared to 2015. The Bats Hotspot acquisition in March 2015 also contributed to the increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Depreciation and Amortization  

Depreciation and amortization stayed flat for three months ended September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to an increase in amortization recorded of

$5.2 million for the intangible assets acquired with the Bats Hotspot Acquisition in March 2015, offset by a $1.6 million decrease in the European Equities segment due to the intangible assets amortized using the cash flow method.  

Systems and Data Communication  

Systems and data communication costs decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to synergies achieved from the Direct Edge Acquisition as the Direct Edge legacy data center space was terminated in the second quarter of 2015. 

Occupancy  

Occupancy expenses remained flat for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily driven by the termination of the lease of the Direct Edge office space in the second quarter of 2015.  

Professional and Contract Services  

Professional and contract services fees increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to $3.4 million of professional fees incurred in 2016 related to the planned merger with CBOE Holdings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, professional and contracted services fees increased due to $3.4 million of professional fees incurred in 2016 for the planned merger with CBOE Holdings and $3.0 million in IPO costs. 

General and Administrative  

General and administrative expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 driven by synergies from the Direct Edge acquisition. General and administrative expenses decreased compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a $6.0 million accelerated expense of legacy Direct Edge servers that were no longer being used after the Direct Edge technology integration in January 2015, offset by a $1.5 million VAT recovery recorded in 2015 and $0.6 million of additional services that occurred in 2016 in preparation of our being a public company. 

Operating Income  

As a result of the items above, operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $55.6 million and $175.9 million, respectively, compared to $54.9 million and $135.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.7 million, or 1.3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and $40.9 million, or 30.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Interest Expense, Net  

Interest expense, net decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to a debt refinancing on June 30, 2016.  The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was also driven by a debt refinancing in 2016 and offset by the additional debt issued in March 2015 to finance the Bats Hotspot Acquisition.  

Loss on extinguishment of debt 

With the refinancing of our debt in second quarter 2016, we recorded a $17.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt. 

Other Income  

33 

Table of Contents  

Other income decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 against the prior year due to the foreign currency gain on the revolving credit facility extinguished in March 2015.  

Income Before Income Tax Provision  

As a result of the above, income before income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $48.5 million and $129.8 million respectively, compared to $42.5 million and $103.4 million for  the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, an increase of $6.0 million and $26.4 million, respectively.  

Income Tax Provision  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, income tax provision was $20.0 million and $53.3 million respectively, compared with $17.2 million and $42.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 41.2% and 41.1%, respectively, compared to 40.5% and 41.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.    The increase in the three months ended September 30, 2016 against the comparable period in the prior year was due to higher non-deductible expenses and tax reserves partially offset by a lower state tax rate.  The decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to a lower state tax rate. 

We are investigating a potential change in our foreign holding company structure. Should this change happen, our future effective tax rate could be impacted and we could incur a material expenditure as a result. 

Net Income  

As a result of the items above, net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $28.5 million and $76.5 million, respectively, compared to $25.3 million and $60.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, an increase of $3.2 million and $16.0 million, respectively.

Operating expenses increased $0.4 million, driven by a decrease of $1.5 million primarily as a result of the decreased average exchange rate of the British pound to the U.S. dollar, offset by the $1.5 million VAT recovery recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues less cost of revenues increased $1.5 million primarily due to a 13.6% increase in net capture driven by the pricing changes implemented in January 2016, offset by a $5.2 million decrease from the decline in the value of the British pound. Operating expenses increased by $1.4 million due to increased compensation and benefit costs and a $1.5 million VAT recovery recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Seasonality  

In the securities and FX industries, quarterly revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to seasonal variations in trading volumes, as well as competition and technological and regulatory changes. Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations, reflecting reduced trading activity generally during the third quarter of each year and during the last month of the year. As a result, our operating results for the third or fourth quarter of any year may not be indicative of the results we expect for the full year.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Historically, we have financed our operations, capital expenditures, dividend payments and other cash needs through cash generated from operations, augmented by private placements of our common stock and issuance of debt.  

In the near term, we expect that our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will meet our cash needs to fund our operations, capital expenditures, debt repayments and any dividends. See Note 8  Debt  of the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.  Our long-term cash needs will depend on many factors including an introduction of new products, enhancements of current products, the geographic mix of our business and any potential acquisitions. We believe our operations and the availability under our revolving credit facility will meet any long-term needs unless an acquisition is identified. 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and all non-restricted, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 decreased $6.0 million from December 31, 2015 primarily due to the net payments of long-term debt of $89.1 million offset by net income of $76.5 million and changes in various other balance sheet accounts. See   Cash Flow  below for further discussion.  

Our cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States in various foreign subsidiaries totaled $41.7 million as of September 30,  2016 and $32.8 million as of December 31, 2015. The remaining balance was held in the United States and totaled $27.4 million as of September 30, 2016 and $42.3 million as of December 31, 2015. The majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, but under current law, could subject us to additional United States income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. In connection with the acquisition of ETF.com on April 1, 2016, we have $1.8 million of restricted cash held to be paid to the sellers of ETF.com within 18 months after acquisition date upon release of seller indemnifications per the terms of the acquisition agreement. 

Our financial investments include investments with original or acquired maturities longer than three months but that mature in less than one year from the statement of financial condition date and are recorded at fair value. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, financial investments primarily consisted of U.S. Treasury securities.

The following table summarizes our cash flow data for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

Table of Contents  

Net Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $4.9 million less than net income. The primary adjustment was the decrease of the Section 31 fees payable of $67.9 million, as the fees were paid to the SEC in September, offset by depreciation and amortization of $31.2 million, the loss on extinguishment of debt of $17.6 million and changes in other various balance sheet accounts. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $52.4 million less than net income. The primary adjustments were a decrease in Section 31 fees payable of $83.5 million, offset by a non-cash adjustment for depreciation and amortization of $28.5 million.  

Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities  

Net cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $26.0 million and $(297.8) million, respectively, and reflected changes in net purchases and redemptions of available-for-sale securities of $47.2 million in 2016 and $61.4 million in 2015. In 2016, we acquired ETF.com for $12.6 million and in 2015 we acquired Bats Hotspot for $360.9 million, net of cash acquired. Purchases of property and equipment were $6.8 million and $12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

We expect to spend $10.0 million to $15.0 million in capital expenditures in 2016 primarily for the general maintenance and ongoing enhancement of our data and telecommunications infrastructure and disaster recovery sites.  

Net Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities  

In connection with the debt refinancing in June 2016, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, (see discussion under   Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations  below), we received proceeds from long-term debt of $646.7 million while making principal payments on long-term debt of $735.8 million.  We also paid $11.0 million in debt issuance costs and $7.7 million in distributions.  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, in connection with the Bats Hotspot Acquisition, $373.8 million of long term debt was issued.  We made $102.4 million in principal payments on long term debt, $16.5 million in payments of debt issuance cost and $4.8 million in distributions. 

Financial Assets  

The following summarizes our financial assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,   2015 (in millions): 

(1) 

Adjusted cash represents cash and cash equivalents plus financial investments minus cash collected for Section 31 fees. We have presented Adjusted cash because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our liquidity and believe that it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies.

Debt  

The following summarizes our debt obligations as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in millions):  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreement.  

In addition to the debt outstanding, as of September 30, 2016, we had an additional $100.0 million available through our revolving credit facility. Together with Adjusted cash, we had $169.6 million available to fund our operations, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, debt repayments and any dividends as of September 30, 2016.  

Contractual Obligations 

As of   September   30, 2016, our contractual obligations included real property leases, operating leases, data and telecommunications agreements, equipment leases and our long-term debt outstanding.  

In June 2016, the Company refinanced its Amended 2014 Loan with a new seven-year $650 million term loan (the 2016 Term Facility).  The 2016 Term Facility decreased the spread on the interest rate to, subject to compliance with a leverage ratio pricing grid, LIBOR plus 350 basis points, and includes 50 basis points of original issue discount. Under the 2016 Term Facility, the required annual amortization also decreased to 1.0% per annum, calculated on the basis of the outstanding principal amount of the 2016 Term Facility. In addition, the Company entered into a new three-year $100 million revolving credit facility with an interest rate based on, subject to compliance with a leverage ratio grid, LIBOR plus 275, which includes an undrawn fee  ,    s  ubject to compliance with a leverage ratio grid, of 37.5 basis points, replacing the revolving credit facility under the Amended 2014 Loan.  

Upon closing of the transaction with CBOE Holdings, the 2016 Term Facility will be repaid. 

If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, Bats may be required to pay CBOE Holdings a termination fee of $110 million or reimburse CBOE Holdings  expenses up to $10 million. 

There were no other material changes outside the ordinary course of our business with respect to our contractual obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from those disclosed in our final prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) on April 15, 2016. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

In the third quarter of 2016, there were no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in our final prospectus filed on April 15, 2016. 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    

41 

Table of Contents  

As a result of our operating activities, we are exposed to market risks such as foreign currency exchange rate risk, equity risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage and monitor and report risk exposures, which are reviewed regularly by management and our board of directors.  

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  

With operations in Europe and Asia, we are subject to currency translation risk as revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Singapore dollar and the Euro. We also have de minimis exposure to other foreign currencies, including the Swiss Franc, Norwegian Kroner, Swedish Krona and Danish Kroner.  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, our exposure to foreign-denominated revenues and expenses is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table:  

(1)  An average foreign exchange rate to the U.S. dollar for the period was used. 

Equity Risk  

Our investment in European operations is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates through translation of our net assets or equity to U.S. dollars. The assets and liabilities of our European business are denominated in British pounds. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate foreign currency reported statements of financial condition and income into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of these non-U.S. dollar statements of financial condition into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment, which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (income) within stockholders' equity on our consolidated statements of financial condition. Our primary exposure to this equity risk as of September 30, 2016 is presented by foreign currency in the following table:  

British Pound (1)  

(in millions)  

Net equity investment in Bats Europe

$  

23.7

(1)  Converted to U.S. dollars using the foreign exchange rate of British pounds into U.S. dollars as of   September   30,  2016. 

Credit Risk  

We are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make investments and execute

Table of Contents  

agreements. While we provide markets for trading listed cash equity securities in the United States and Europe and listed equity options in the United States, we do not trade securities for our own account. We invest available cash in highly liquid, short-term investments, such as U.S. Treasury securities. Our investment policy is to preserve capital and liquidity. We do not believe there is significant risk associated with these short-term investments.  

We do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to trades matched on BZX, BYX, EDGX, EDGA and Bats Europe. With respect to listed cash equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to NSCC without taking on counterparty risk for those trades. NSCC acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on BZX, BYX, EDGX and EDGA and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched equity trades. Similarly, with respect to U.S. listed equity options, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the OCC, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on BZX and EDGX and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options trades.  

In addition, with respect to orders Bats Trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers, Bats Trading is exposed to some counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our clearing firms, Morgan Stanley or Wedbush Securities. Morgan Stanley and Wedbush Securities guarantee trades until one day after the trade date, after which time NSCC provides a guarantee. Thus, Bats Trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to a trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that Morgan Stanley or Wedbush Securities fails. We believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and accordingly, have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees.  

Similarly, with respect to orders in U.S. listed equity options, we route orders for execution to other national securities exchanges through either Bats Trading or through affiliates of Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wedbush Securities, as discussed above. For orders in U.S. listed equity options routed through Bank of America Merrill Lynch, or Wedbush Securities and executed on another national securities exchange, Bats Trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to Bank of America Merrill Lynch or Wedbush Securities until a trade settles (generally one day after the trade date). For orders in U.S. listed equity options routed directly by Bats Trading to, and executed on, another national securities exchange, Bats Trading also has counterparty credit exposure to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which acts as Bats Trading's options clearing firm on such transactions. We believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote. Accordingly, we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements for these guarantees.  

Historically, we have not incurred any liability due to a customer s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade. Credit difficulties or insolvency, or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency, of one or more larger or visible market participants could also result in market-wide credit difficulties or other market disruptions.  

We do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to institutional spot FX trades occurring on the Bats Hotspot Platform because Bats Hotspot is not a counterparty to any FX transactions. All transactions occurring on the Bats Hotspot Platform occur bilaterally between two banks or prime brokers as counterparties to the trade. While Bats Hotspot does not have direct counterparty risk, Bats Hotspot may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event. Therefore, Bats Hotspot may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade FX on the Bats Hotspot Platform.  

We also have credit risk related to transaction fees that are billed in arrears to customers on a monthly basis. Our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our consolidated statements of financial condition. Our customers are financial institutions whose ability to satisfy their contractual obligations may be impacted by volatile securities markets.  

On a regular basis, we review and evaluate changes in the status of our counterparties  creditworthiness. Credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Any such effects to date have been minimal.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures   

(a)   Disclosure controls and procedures.   Bats Global Markets, Inc. s management, with the participation of Bats Global Markets, Inc. s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of Bats Global Markets, Inc. s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.        Legal Proceedings.       

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Bats Global Markets, Inc. incorporates herein by reference the discussion set forth in Note 18 ( Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees Legal Proceedings ) of the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein, and no other matters were reportable during the period.  In addition to the matters incorporated herein by reference, Bats Global Markets, Inc. is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Bats Global Markets, Inc. does not believe, based on currently available information, that the results of any of these various proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements as a whole. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors.       

In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties in our final prospectus filed on April 15, 2016, in our Form 10-Q filed on August 4, 2016, and those detailed below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. 

Risks Relating to the Planned Merger     

Failure to complete the planned merger within the expected timeframe or at all could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.     

There can be no assurance that the planned merger will occur. The closing of the merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon, (ii) approval of the issuance of shares of CBOE Holdings  common stock in the Merger by the holders of at least a majority of the shares of CBOE Holdings  common stock entitled to vote thereon and present in person or represented by proxy at the CBOE Holdings stockholder meeting called for such purpose, (iii) the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and regulatory approval by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, (iv) no court order or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the planned merger transactions or imposing a  burdensome effect  (as defined in the Merger Agreement) upon the consummation thereof, (v) the absence of any pending action commenced by a governmental or regulatory body wherein a judgment would reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the planned merger transactions or impose a burdensome effect upon the consummation thereof, (vi) receipt of tax opinions from counsel to each of us and CBOE Holdings with respect to the treatment of the planned merger transactions from a tax perspective, (vii) in the case of CBOE Holdings  obligation to effect the merger, no exercise of appraisal rights by our stockholders holding more than 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, (viii) in the case of each party s obligation to effect the planned merger, the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to the other party since the date of the Merger Agreement, and (ix) subject to materiality exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by CBOE Holdings, CBOE Corporation and CBOE V, LLC, on the one hand, and us on the other hand, and compliance by us and CBOE Holdings, CBOE Corporation and CBOE V, LLC in all material respects with each party s respective obligations under the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the planned merger will be satisfied in a timely matter or at all.  

In particular, before the proposed transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the planned merger, may be completed, various clearances and approvals must be obtained from certain regulatory and governmental authorities.  These regulatory and governmental entities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals.  Such conditions and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the planned merger or of imposing additional costs or limitations on the combined company following the planned merger.  The regulatory approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion and may contain conditions on the completion of the planned merger.  However, if any such conditions impose a  burdensome effect  as defined in the Merger Agreement, the parties may not be obligated to complete the planned merger, and either we or CBOE Holdings may have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement.  In addition, our and CBOE Holdings  respective obligations to   

45 

Table of Contents  

complete the planned merger are conditioned on the receipt of certain regulatory approvals or waiver by the other party of such condition. 

If CBOE Holdings  financing for the planned merger becomes unavailable, the planned merger may not be completed. 

CBOE Holdings intends to finance all or a portion of the cash component of the merger consideration with debt financing. There are a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived in order for closing of the debt financing to occur. There is a risk that these conditions will not be satisfied. In the event that the financing currently contemplated is not available, CBOE Holdings may be required to obtain alternative financing on terms that are less favorable to CBOE Holdings than those currently contemplated by CBOE Holdings. In addition, any alternative financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. While obtaining financing is not a condition to CBOE Holdings  obligation to effect the planned merger under the Merger Agreement, if other financing becomes necessary and CBOE Holdings is unable to secure such other financing, the planned merger may not be completed. 

The Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us for a value greater than the   merger consideration  . 

The Merger Agreement contains provisions that apply both during the pendency of the   merger   transaction with CBOE Holdings as well as afterward should the planned   merger   with CBOE Holdings not be consummated that may discourage a third party from submitting a business combination proposal to us that might result in greater value to our stockholders than the planned CBOE Holdings   merger  .  These Merger Agreement provisions include a general prohibition on us from soliciting, or, subject to certain exceptions, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offers for competing transactions.  In addition, we may be required to pay CBOE Holdings a termination fee in certain circumstances involving acquisition proposals for competing transactions. 

Failure to complete the planned merger could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results. 

If the planned   merger   is not completed, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks and consequences, including the following: 

We may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay CBOE Holdings a termination fee of $110 million or reimburse CBOE Holdings  expenses up to $10 million under the Merger Agreement;     

We will be required to pay certain costs relating to the planned   merger  , whether or not the planned   merger   is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees;     

Under the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the planned   merger   that may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies; and     

Matters relating to the planned   merger   may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company and such commitments by our management may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.     

In addition, if the planned   merger   is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees.  We also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the planned   merger   or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.  If the planned   merger   is not completed, we cannot assure our stockholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
