NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANICAL STATEMENTS   

(Unaudited) 

1.          DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS 

Matson, Inc., a holding company incorporated in January 2012 in the State of Hawaii, and its subsidiaries ( Matson  or the  Company ), is a leading provider of ocean transportation and logistics services.  The Company consists of two segments, Ocean Transportation and Logistics: 

Ocean Transportation:     Matson s Ocean Transportation business is conducted through Matson Navigation Company, Inc. ( MatNav ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Matson, Inc.  Founded in 1882, MatNav is an asset-based business that provides a vital lifeline of ocean freight transportation services to the domestic offshore economies of Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam, and to other island economies including Micronesia and various islands in the South Pacific.  MatNav also operates a premium, expedited service from China to Long Beach, California.  In addition, subsidiaries of MatNav provide container stevedoring, container equipment maintenance and other terminal services for MatNav and other ocean carriers on the Hawaiian islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui and Kauai, and in the Alaska locations of Anchorage, Kodiak, Dutch Harbor and Akutan.  The Company's fleet of 22 owned vessels includes containerships, combination container and roll-on/roll-off ships and custom-designed barges. 

The Company has a 35 percent ownership interest in SSA Terminals, LLC ( SSAT ), a joint venture between Matson Ventures, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MatNav, and SSA Ventures, Inc., a subsidiary of Carrix, Inc.  SSAT provides terminal and stevedoring services to various carriers at six terminal facilities on the West Coast of the United States of America ( U.S. ), including to MatNav at several of those facilities.  Matson records its share of income or loss in the joint venture in operating costs in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, and within the Ocean Transportation segment due to the nature of SSAT s operations. 

Logistics:   The Company s logistics business is conducted through Matson Logistics, Inc. ( Matson Logistics ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MatNav.  Established in 1987, Matson Logistics is an asset-light business that provides multimodal transportation services, including domestic and international rail intermodal service ( Intermodal ); long-haul and regional highway brokerage, specialized hauling, flat-bed and project services, less-than-truckload services, and expedited freight services (collectively "Highway"); less-than-container load consolidation and freight forwarding services (collectively  Freight Forwarding ); supply chain management; and warehousing and distribution services. 

On August 4, 2016, Matson Logistics completed the purchase of 100 percent of the membership interests of Span Intermediate, LLC ( Span Alaska ), a Freight Forwarding business (see Note 3, Business Combinations). 

2.          GENERAL AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation:   The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Matson, Inc. and all wholly-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of significant intercompany revenues, and costs and expenses.  Significant investments in businesses, partnerships, and limited liability companies in which the Company does not have a controlling financial interest, but has the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method.  A controlling financial interest is one in which the Company has a majority voting interest or one in which the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. 

Due to the nature of the Company s operations and the Company s acquisition of Horizon Lines, Inc. ( Horizon ) on May 29, 2015, and Span Alaska on August 4, 2016, the results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year.  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim periods, and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.   

The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on February 26, 2016.

Table of Contents  

The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income include the operations of Horizon from May 29, 2015, and Span Alaska from August 4, 2016. 

Fiscal Period:   The period end for Matson, Inc. covered by this report is September 30, 2016.  The period end for MatNav and its subsidiaries covered by this report occurred on the last Friday in September, or September 23, 2016. 

Significant Accounting Policies:   The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Property and Equipment:   Property and equipment was $908.1 million and $860.3 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and is recorded net of accumulated depreciation of $1,183.8 million and $1,128.6 million, respectively.  Property and equipment includes vessel construction expenditures of $67.3 million and $29.2 million, and capitalized interest of $1.9 million and $0.8 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Goodwill:   Changes in the Company s goodwill for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consist of the following (in millions): 

Additions to Ocean Transportation goodwill for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, relate to the Horizon acquisition, and additions to Logistics goodwill for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, relate to the Span Alaska acquisition (see Note 3,   Business Combinations  ). 

Intangible Assets, Net:   Intangible assets were $239.1 million and $139.1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and were recorded net of accumulated amortization of $18.5 million and $12.3 million, respectively.

Table of Contents  

Capital Construction Fund:   The Company s Capital Construction Fund ( CCF ) is described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $110.9 million and nominal amounts on deposit in the CCF, respectively.  These amounts are held in a money market account and classified as long-term assets in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the Company intends to use qualified cash withdrawals to fund long-term investment in the construction of new vessels. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made cash deposits of $110.8 million into the CCF.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company made cash deposits of $123.4 million into the CCF.  Additionally, $12.5 million of qualified cash withdrawal was made from the CCF during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  On October 21, 2016, the Company withdrew $32.5 million from the CCF and paid a scheduled progress payment associated with the construction of the new vessels. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $165.1 million and $176.6 million, respectively, of eligible accounts receivable were assigned to the CCF.  Due to the nature of the assignment of eligible accounts receivable into the CCF, such assigned amounts are classified as part of accounts receivable in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss:   Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component, net of tax, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in millions):

Contingencies:   Environmental Matters:   In September 2013, molasses was released into Honolulu Harbor from a pipeline system operated by a subsidiary of the Company.  The Company cooperated with federal and state agencies involved in responding to and investigating the incident.  The Hawaii Department of Health reported on September 20, 2013 that dissolved oxygen and pH levels in the harbor and nearby Keehi Lagoon had returned to normal target levels and that there was no longer discoloration of the water in those same areas attributable to the molasses release.  Keehi Lagoon was reopened to the public on September 21, 2013. 

The Company previously resolved all federal criminal claims, and all criminal, civil and administrative claims that the State of Hawaii may have had arising from the molasses release.  On October 13, 2016, the United States Department of Justice delivered a letter to Company counsel stating that it is prepared to file a civil penalty action under the Clean Water Act but would be willing to discuss a potential resolution of those claims prior to filing an action.  The Company believes it has defenses against those claims. 

In addition to the molasses release discussed above, the Company s ocean transportation business has certain other risks that could result in expenditures for environmental remediation.  The Company believes that based on all information available to it, the Company is currently in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 

Other Matters:   The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to, or may be contingently liable in connection with other legal actions arising in the normal course of their businesses, the outcomes of which, in the opinion of management after consultation with counsel, would not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Subsequent Event:   On October 27, 2016, the Company entered into a private placement commitment letter under which it expects to issue $75 million of 11-year senior unsecured notes (the  11-year Notes ) within 90 days, subject to entering into definitive documentation and satisfying other customary closing conditions.  The 11-year Notes are expected to have a weighted average life of approximately 8 years, a fixed interest rate of 3.37 percent, and financial and other covenants that are substantially the same as the covenants in the Company s existing outstanding senior unsecured notes.  Proceeds of the 11-year Notes are expected to be used to pay down the Company s revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. 

New Accounting Pronouncements:     Leases:   In February 2016,   the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )   No. 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842)    ( ASU 2016-02 ), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice.  ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments, and a right-of-use asset for the underlying leased asset for the period of the lease term.  The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted.    The Company is in the process of evaluating this guidance. 

Share-Based Awards:   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.     The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is in the process of evaluating this guidance. 

3.          BUSINESS COMBINATION 

Span Alaska Acquisition:    On August 4, 2016 (the  Effective Date ), Matson Logistics completed the purchase of 100 percent of the membership interests of Span Alaska pursuant to the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated July 18, 2016.  At the Effective Date, Span Alaska became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Matson Logistics.  Span Alaska is an asset-light logistics company providing freight forwarding services primarily to the Alaska market.  Span Alaska consolidates freight in Auburn, Washington, for shipment to Alaska and distribution through a network of terminals in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Wasilla, Kenai, Juneau and Kodiak.  Span Alaska s operations are recorded within the Logistics segment of the Company.

The Span Alaska acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805.  The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Span Alaska acquisition were recorded based on fair value estimates as of the Effective Date, with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill.  Such fair value estimates require significant judgement, and include estimates used in the valuation of property and equipment, and intangible assets.  The Company s fair value estimates are subject to revision pending the Company s final fair value analysis and purchase price calculations.  Final estimates of fair value may be significantly different from those reflected in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2016.

Property and equipment:   Property and equipment of $8.1 million includes the fair value of terminal and transportation equipment (trucks, forklifts, trailers, containers and other warehouse equipment), leasehold improvements and other office equipment. 

Intangibles -   The customer relationships and trade name intangible assets were recorded using preliminary information obtained from valuation specialists engaged by the Company to assist management with estimating the fair value of these intangible assets.  

Customer relationships: Intangibles of $79.0 million related to customer relationships which are being amortized over 20 years.  In determining the amortization period, the Company considered the historical trends of Span Alaska s customers and related attrition rates.  The Company also considered potential future attrition risks, existing competition, the costs associated with establishing a Freight Forwarding business including the need to develop a broad base of customer relationships over a period of time.  Furthermore, the Company considered existing relationships with ocean transportation service providers in Alaska, and the potential impact on competition.  As a result, the Company believes that Span Alaska s customers are considered less vulnerable to attrition.  

Trade name: Intangibles of $27.3 million related to the Span Alaska trade name, which was determined to have an indefinite life.  Span Alaska has operated for a period in excess of 38 years, and its trade name is widely known in Alaska for high quality and reliable Freight Forwarding services.  The Span Alaska operations will continue to be operated under the Span Alaska trade name, independent of Matson s ocean transportation operation in Alaska.  

Span Alaska s debt:   The Company repaid all of Span Alaska s debt including accrued interest of $81.9 million, as of the Effective Date.

Table of Contents  

Goodwill:   The Company recorded goodwill of $79.0 million from the Span Acquisition, which represents the excess of the fair value of consideration paid by the Company over the fair value of the underlying identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.   In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805,   Business Combination   ( ASC 805 ), goodwill will not be amortized, but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or circumstances have occurred that may indicate a possible impairment.   

Goodwill arises as a result of several factors: (i) The Span Alaska acquisition significantly expands Matson s Logistics  platform and Matson s long-term commitment into the Alaska market; (ii) Span Alaska is a leading freight forwarding business and continues to be led by an experienced management team and assembled workforce with knowledge of the Alaska industry and of its customers; and (iii) the additional growth potential of Span Alaska.   

The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include operating revenue of $8.5 million (after elimination of intercompany revenue), and operating income of $1.3 million, respectively, from Span Alaska s operations.  One-time acquisition related costs of approximately $2.9 million incurred as a result of the Span Alaska acquisition, is included in selling, general and administrative costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.    

Horizon Acquisition:   On May 29, 2015, Matson completed its acquisition of Horizon whereby MatNav acquired Horizon s Alaska operations and assumed all of Horizon s non-Hawaii assets and liabilities (the  Horizon Acquisition ).  Immediately before the completion of the Horizon Acquisition, Horizon sold certain of its subsidiaries to the Pasha Group (the  Pasha Transaction ) that: (i) conducted Horizon s Hawaii operations (including owning the assets used to conduct such Hawaii operations and being responsible for the liabilities related thereto), and (ii) employed the Horizon employees who conducted its Hawaii operations.  Horizon also completed the termination of its Puerto Rico operations during the first quarter of 2015.  The Alaska operations are recorded within the Ocean Transportation segment of the Company. 

Total consideration for the Horizon Acquisition was $495.4 million based on the fair value of common shares of $29.4 million, warrants of $37.1 million, and Horizon s debt including accrued interest and breakage fees of $428.9 million.  Immediately following the close of the Horizon Acquisition, the Company repaid the assumed debt and redeemed all of Horizon s outstanding warrants. 

The Horizon Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805.  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair value at May 29, 2015, with the remaining unallocated purchase price of $217.7 million recorded as goodwill.  As of June 30, 2016, the purchase price accounting for the Horizon Acquisition was considered final.   

The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include operating revenue of $74.0 million and $208.2 million, and operating income of $11.3 million and $21.6 million, respectively, from Horizon s operations.  One-time acquisition related costs incurred post December 31, 2015 were not material.

4.          DEBT 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s debt consisted of the following (in millions): 

The Company s debt is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Term Loans:   On September 14, 2016, the Company entered into an amended and restated private placement note purchase agreement (the  2016 Note Purchase Agreement ), pursuant to which Matson issued $200.0 million in 15-year final maturity senior unsecured notes (the  Series D Notes ).  The Series D Notes have a weighted average life of   

10 

Table of Contents  

approximately 8.5 years and bear interest at a rate of 3.14 percent, payable semi-annually.  Proceeds from the Series D Notes were used to pay down the Company s revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.  

The Series D Notes will begin to amortize in March 2019, with semi-annual principal payments of $6.0 million in 2019.  During the years 2020 to 2023, the semi-annual principal payments will be $9.2 million.  Starting in March 2024, and in each year thereafter through maturity in September 2031, the semi-annual principal payments will be $7.15 million. 

The 2016 Note Purchase Agreement amends and restates Matson s Second Amended and Restated Note Agreement dated as of June 4, 2012, as amended prior to the date hereof, under which, in addition to the Series D Notes, an aggregate principal amount of approximately $184.3 million in Matson s existing Series B and C senior unsecured notes is outstanding as of the date hereof.  The 2016 Note Purchase Agreement also includes an uncommitted shelf facility pursuant to which Matson may, subject to the conditions and limitations specified in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement, issue additional notes. 

Matson s obligations under the existing senior notes and the Series D Notes are guaranteed by Matson s principal operating subsidiary MatNav and by certain other subsidiaries. 

Principal covenants contained in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement include, but are not limited to, the requirements that Matson:  

a) 

Not permit the ratio of debt to consolidated EBITDA to exceed 3.25 to 1.00 for each fiscal four quarter period, except under certain pre-defined circumstances;     

b) 

Not permit the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to interest expense as of the end of any fiscal four quarter period to be less than 3.50 to 1.00; and     

c) 

Not permit the aggregate principal amount of Priority Debt at any time to exceed 20% (subject to reduction to 17.5% upon the earlier of December 31, 2017 and upon the occurrence of certain events) of Consolidated Tangible Assets; and not permit the aggregate principal amount of Priority Debt that is not Title XI Priority Debt at any time to exceed 10% of Consolidated Tangible Assets (all as defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement).     

Furthermore, the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement generally will restrict the incurrence of liens except for permitted liens, which include, without limitation, liens securing Title XI Debt (as defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement) up to certain thresholds.  Additionally, prepayment of amounts borrowed under the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement may be made in whole or in part at par plus a yield maintenance premium, as defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement. 

The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2016. 

Revolving Credit Facility:   Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are classified as long-term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, as principal payments are not required until maturity date of July 30, 2020.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $193.8 million of remaining availability under the revolving credit facility.  The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility approximated 1.69 percent during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

5.          PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT PLANS 

The Company sponsors qualified defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans (collectively, the  Plans ).  The following table provides the components of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) for the Plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in millions): 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company contributed $7.5 million to its defined benefit pension plans.  No further contribution is expected to be paid in 2016.

6.          SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted approximately 15,500 and 325,000 of time-based and performance-based shares to certain of its employees at a $36.95 and $37.64 weighted-average grant date fair value, respectively.   

Total stock-based compensation cost recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses was $3.0 million and $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $9.2 million and $9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements was $14.9 million at September 30, 2016, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.  Total unrecognized compensation cost may be adjusted for any unearned performance shares or forfeited shares. 

7.          EARNINGS PER-SHARE 

The number of shares used to compute basic and diluted earnings per-share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, is as follows (in millions, except per-share amounts): 

Basic earnings per-share is determined by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period.  The calculation of diluted earnings per-share includes the dilutive effect of unexercised non-qualified stock options and non-vested restricted stock units.   

The computation of weighted-average dilutive shares outstanding excludes certain non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of common stock where the options  exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the Company s common stock for the periods presented and, therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive.  The number of such shares excluded was nominal.

8.          FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

The Company values its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques for fair value measurements.  Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.  Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset or liability.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  If the technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy, the lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. 

The Company uses Level 1 inputs for the fair values of its cash equivalents, and Level 2 inputs for its accounts receivable, variable rate debt and fixed rate debt.  The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and variable rate debt approximate their carrying values due to the nature of the instruments.  The fair value of the Company s fixed rate debt is calculated based upon interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to the Company s existing debt arrangements. 

The carrying value and fair value of the Company s financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows (in millions): 

9.          REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 

Reportable segments are components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.  The Company's chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. 

The Company consists of two reportable segments, Ocean Transportation and Logistics, which are further described in Note 1.  Reportable segments are measured based on operating profit, exclusive of interest expense, general corporate expenses, and income taxes.  In arrangements where the customer purchases ocean transportation and logistics services, the revenues are allocated to each reportable segment based upon the contractual amounts for each type of service.  

The Company s Ocean Transportation segment provides ocean transportation services to the Logistics segment.  Accordingly, intersegment revenue of $6.7 million and $10.3 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $3.4 million and $8.9 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, have been eliminated from the Logistics segment in the table below.   

The Company's Terminal Joint Venture segment has been aggregated into the Company's Ocean Transportation segment due to the operations of the Terminal Joint Venture being an integral part of the Company's Ocean Transportation business and has similar economic characteristics.

The discussion that follows is intended to provide information that will assist in understanding the changes in the Company s financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that accounted for those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect the Company s financial statements.  MD A is provided as a supplement to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes herein, and should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the Company s reports filed on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, and other publicly available information. 

BUSINESS OUTLOOK 

The Company s 2016 outlook includes the effects of the acquisition of Span Alaska in the fourth quarter 2016. 

Ocean Transportation:   The Company s third quarter 2016 Hawaii container volume declined year-over-year, primarily due to the absence of volume gains associated with a competitor s service reconfiguration and service issues in the third quarter 2015, and a slower than expected growth environment.  Despite the lull in market volumes during the third quarter 2016, the Company continues to believe that the Hawaii economy is healthy and expects construction activity to support market growth in the future.  For the fourth quarter 2016, the Company expects its Hawaii container volume to be lower than the fourth quarter 2015, which benefited from volume gains associated with a competitor s service reconfiguration and related issues.

Table of Contents  

In China, the Company s container volume in the third quarter 2016 was slightly lower year-over-year, as continued market softness in the first two months of the quarter was partially offset by increased demand for the Company s expedited service offering related to the market dislocation that followed Hanjin Shipping s bankruptcy filing on September 1, 2016.  The Company realized a sizeable rate premium in the third quarter 2016, but as expected, average freight rates were significantly lower than the third quarter 2015.  In the fourth quarter 2016, the Company expects higher container volume as its expedited service offering remains highly differentiated amid a challenged international container shipping market that continues to be plagued by chronic over-capacity. 

In Guam, as expected, the Company s container volume in the third quarter 2016 was modestly lower on a year-over-year basis, the result of competitive losses to a bi-weekly U.S. flagged containership service that commenced in January 2016.  In the fourth quarter 2016, the Company expects to experience continued modest competitive volume losses.  

In Alaska, the Company s container volume for the third quarter 2016 was lower than expected, declining more than 10 percent year-over-year as northbound freight volume was challenged by energy sector related macroeconomic headwinds and southbound volume was impacted by an unexpectedly lower seafood harvest in 2016.  For the fourth quarter 2016, the Company expects the ongoing muted economic activity in Alaska to result in container volume that approximates the level achieved in the fourth quarter 2015. 

For the full year 2016, the Company s terminal joint venture, SSAT, is expected to contribute profits lower than the $16.5 million contributed in 2015, primarily due to the absence of factors related to the clearing of international cargo backlog in the first half 2015 that resulted from the U.S. West Coast labor disruptions. 

As a result, the Company expects fourth quarter 2016 Ocean Transportation operating income to be approximately 15 percent lower than the fourth quarter 2015 level of $43.6 million. 

Logistics:   On August 4, 2016, Matson Logistics completed its previously announced acquisition of Span Alaska, a market leading provider of less-than container load freight consolidation and forwarding services to Alaska, for total consideration of $199.1 million (the  Span Alaska Acquisition ).    As a result, the Company expects its Logistics segment operating income for the full year 2016 to be approximately $11 million. 

Interest Expense:   The Company expects its interest expense in 2016 to be approximately $24 million, including interest related to the issuance of $200 million of 15-year senior unsecured notes on September 14, 2016, bearing interest at 3.14 percent. 

Income Tax Expense:     The Company expects its effective tax rate for the full year 2016 to be approximately 39 percent. 

Capital Spending and Vessel Dry-docking:   On August 25, 2016, MatNav and General Dynamics NASSCO ( NASSCO ) entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which NASSCO will construct two new combination container and roll-on/roll-off vessels for the Company s Hawaii fleet at a contract price of $511 million for both vessels, with deliveries scheduled for the end of 2019 and mid-year 2020.    In the first nine months of 2016, the Company made capital expenditure payments of $67.3 million, capitalized vessel construction expenditures of $39.2 million, and dry-docking payments of $43.7 million.  For the full year 2016, the Company expects to make capital expenditure payments of approximately $90 million, capitalized vessel construction expenditures of approximately $96 million, and   dry-docking payments of approximately $57 million.    For the full year 2016, the Company expects depreciation and amortization to total approximately $136 million compared to $105.8 million in 2015, inclusive of dry-docking amortization of approximately $38 million expected in 2016 and $23.1 million in 2015.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Consolidated Results: Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 2015: 

Consolidated results of operations include the logistics operating results of Span Alaska from the date of the Span Alaska acquisition on August 4, 2016.  Changes in operating revenue, and operating costs and expenses are further described below in the Analysis of Operating Revenue and Income by Segment. 

Consolidated operating revenue for the third quarter 2016 decreased $43.9 million, or 8.1 percent, compared to the third quarter 2015.  This decrease was due to $46.8 million lower revenue from Ocean Transportation, offset by $2.9 million higher revenue from Logistics. 

Operating costs and expenses for the third quarter 2016 decreased $18.3 million, or 3.9 percent, compared to the third quarter 2015.  The decrease was due to a $20.6 million decrease in operating costs and expenses from Ocean Transportation, offset by a $2.3 million increase in operating costs and expenses from Logistics.   

Interest expense increased $1.3 million to $6.0 million for the third quarter 2016 compared to $4.7 million in third quarter 2015, due to non-cash interest accretion of the fair value of the Puerto Rico multi-employer liability, and increased revolver and long-term borrowings during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Income tax expense was $15.2 million, or 37.8 percent of income before income taxes, for the third quarter 2016, compared to $25.6 million, or 38.2 percent of income before income taxes, for the third quarter 2015.  The income tax rate for 2015 was negatively impacted by non-deductible expenses as a result of the Horizon Acquisition in 2015. 

Consolidated Results: Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 2015: 

Consolidated results of operations include ocean transportation operating results of Alaska and logistics operating results of Span Alaska from the date of the Horizon Acquisition on May 29, 2015, and the Span Alaska acquisition on August 4, 2016, respectively.  Changes in operating revenue, and operating costs and expenses are further described below in the Analysis of Operating Revenue and Income by Segment.

Table of Contents  

Consolidated operating revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $32.2 million, or 2.3 percent, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase was due to $38.0 million higher revenue from Ocean Transportation, offset by $5.8 million lower revenue from Logistics. 

Operating costs and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $65.7 million, or 5.3 percent, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was due to a $72.6 million increase, offset by a $6.9 million decrease in operating costs and expenses from Ocean Transportation and Logistics segments, respectively.   

Interest expense increased $3.8 million to $17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $13.6 million in nine months ended September 30, 2015, due to non-cash interest accretion of the fair value of the Puerto Rico multi-employer liability, and increased revolver and long-term borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Income tax expense was $38.4 million, or 38.6 percent of income before income taxes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $60.4 million, or 44.2 percent of income before income taxes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The income tax rate for 2015 was negatively impacted by a non-cash adjustment to deferred tax assets, and by changes in the value of deferred taxes and non-deductible expenses as a result of the Horizon Acquisition. 

ANALYSIS OF OPERATING REVENUE AND INCOME BY SEGMENT 

Ocean Transportation Operating Results: Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 2015: 

(1) 

Approximate volumes included for the period are based on the voyage departure date, but revenue and operating income are adjusted to reflect the percentage of revenue and operating income earned during the reporting period for voyages in transit at the end of each reporting period.     

Ocean Transportation revenue decreased $46.8 million, or 10.5 percent, during the third quarter 2016 compared with the third quarter 2015.  This decrease was primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenue, lower freight rates in the Company s China service, and lower container volume in Hawaii, Alaska and Guam, partially offset by higher freight rates in Hawaii and Guam. 

On a  year-over-year FEU basis, Hawaii container volume decreased by 8.0 percent primarily due the absence of volume gains attributed to a competitor's service reconfiguration and vessel mechanical failure in the prior year; Alaska volume decreased by 10.7 percent due to ongoing macroeconomic headwinds related to energy prices and a lower seafood harvest; China volume was 3.0 percent lower due to continued market softness; and Guam volume was 4.6 percent lower due to competitive losses associated with the launch of a competitor s bi-weekly U.S. flagged containership service in January 2016. 

Ocean Transportation operating income decreased $26.2 million, or 38.0 percent, during the third quarter 2016 compared with the third quarter 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to lower freight rates in China, and lower container volume in Hawaii and Alaska.  Partially offsetting these unfavorable year-over-year comparisons were the absence of selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Horizon Acquisition, and higher freight rates in Hawaii and Guam.

The Company s SSAT terminal joint venture investment contributed $3.6 million during the third quarter 2016, compared to $4.5 million in the third quarter 2015.  The $0.9 million year-over-year decrease was primarily due to an increase in SSAT s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, partially offset by improved lift volume. 

Ocean Transportation Operating Results: Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 2015: 

(2) 

Approximate volumes included for the period are based on the voyage departure date, but revenue and operating income are adjusted to reflect the percentage of revenue and operating income earned during the reporting period for voyages in transit at the end of each reporting period.     

Ocean Transportation revenue increased $38.0 million, or 3.5 percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase was primarily due to the inclusion of revenue from the Company s acquired Alaska service for the full nine-month period and higher container volume and yield in Hawaii, partially offset by lower freight rates and container volume in the Company s China service and lower fuel surcharge revenue. 

On a year-over-year FEU basis, Hawaii container volume increased by 2.2 percent due to competitive gains associated with a competitors  service reconfiguration in 2015 and modest market growth; Alaska volume increased due to the inclusion of a full nine-month period in 2016; China volume was 10.3 percent lower due to market softness and the absence of the high demand experienced in the first half of 2015 related to the U.S. West Coast labor disruptions; and Guam volume was 2.1 percent lower primarily due to competitive losses associated with the launch of a competitor s bi-weekly U.S. flagged containership service in January 2016. 

Ocean Transportation operating income decreased $34.6 million, or 24.0 percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to lower freight rates and volume in the China service, higher vessel operating expenses related to the deployment of additional vessels in the Hawaii trade in the first half of 2016, and higher terminal handling expenses.  Partially offsetting these unfavorable items were the absence of selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Horizon Acquisition and costs related to the Molasses Settlement, and container volume and yield improvements in Hawaii. 

The Company s SSAT terminal joint venture investment contributed $9.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $13.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  On a year-over-year basis, SSAT s lift volume improved during the first nine months of 2016; however, the positive impact of lift volume was more than offset by the absence of the benefits related to the clearing of international cargo volume after the U.S. West Coast labor disruptions in the first half 2015 and by an increase in SSAT s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.

The increase was due primarily to the acquisition of new containers and terminal equipment, capital expenditures on vessels including the installation of scrubbers on vessels acquired as part of the Horizon Acquisition, and other capital expenditure.  Capitalized vessel construction expenditures were $39.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily related to scheduled vessel construction contract payments.  There were no payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Changes in deposits into the CCF, and withdrawals from the CCF during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are due to expected future qualified withdrawals from the CCF related to vessel construction expenditures. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid $112.8 million related to the acquisition of Span Alaska compared to $29.0 million paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to the Horizon Acquisition and other acquisitions (see Note 3,   Business Combinations  , of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 

(3) Change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities: 

Changes in net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015 are due to the following: 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company repaid all of Horizon s outstanding debt and redeemed the warrants related to the Horizon Acquisition, for total payments of $467.5 million.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repaid $81.9 million of borrowings related to the Span Acquisition.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company borrowed $200.0 million in long-term debt.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company increased its net borrowings under its revolving credit facility to $195.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $118.0 million at September 30, 2015, primarily to fund increased dry-docking and capital expenditures, share repurchases, and cash deposits into the CCF.  During nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid $37.8 million in share repurchases.  There were no share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

Environmental Matters:    In September 2013, molasses was released into Honolulu Harbor from a pipeline system operated by a subsidiary of the Company.  The Company cooperated with federal and state agencies involved in responding to and investigating the incident.  The Hawaii Department of Health reported on September 20, 2013 that dissolved oxygen and pH levels in the harbor and nearby Keehi Lagoon had returned to normal target levels and that there was no longer discoloration of the water in those same areas attributable to the molasses release.  Keehi Lagoon was reopened to the public on September 21, 2013. 

The Company previously resolved all federal criminal claims, and all criminal, civil and administrative claims that the State of Hawaii may have had arising from the molasses release.  On October 13, 2016, the United States Department of Justice delivered a letter to Company counsel stating that it is prepared to file a civil penalty action under the Clean Water Act but would be willing to discuss a potential resolution of those claims prior to filing an action. The Company believes it has defenses against those claims. 

In addition to the molasses release discussed above, the Company s ocean transportation business has certain other risks that could result in expenditures for environmental remediation.  The Company believes that based on all information available to it, the Company is currently in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 

Other Matters:    The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to, or may be contingently liable in connection with other legal actions arising in the normal course of their businesses, the outcomes of which, in the opinion of management after consultation with counsel, would not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS   

There were no material changes to the Company s risk factors that are described in Part I, Item 1A under the caption of  Risk Factors  of Matson s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016, and the risk factors that are described in Part II, Item 1A under the caption of  Risk Factors  of Matson s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on August 3, 2016.

NOW THEREFORE  , Purchaser and Contractor agree as follows: 

AGREEMENT 

1                   STATEMENT OF WORK 

(a)        Contract Work  .  Contractor shall furnish all facilities, labor, supervision, material, supplies, machinery and equipment, outfit, appurtenances and appliances and shall perform all work necessary to design, engineer, construct, launch, equip, outfit, test and deliver two Vessels (NASSCO Hull Numbers 601 and 602) qualified for United States coastwise trade, and foreign trade as set forth in the Specifications (such coastwise and foreign trade, the  Trade ), in compliance with the Jones Act, in accordance with the Specifications and Vessel Drawings (as defined below in the SPECIFICATIONS AND VESSEL DRAWINGS Article 2) and this Contract.  Contractor shall do everything required of it by this Contract, the Specifications, and the Vessel Drawings, including the development of Design Products (as defined below in the DESIGN RIGHTS Article 10) and the installation of any material that the Contract and/or the Specifications provides shall be furnished by Purchaser (collectively referred to in this Contract as the  Contract Work"), for the total consideration of the Contract Price as defined in PRICING Article 3. 

(b)        Vessel Certification and Classification  .  Other than with respect to the ballast water management system as described in the SPECIFICATIONS AND VESSEL DRAWINGS Article 2, Contractor shall obtain all requisite approvals from applicable U.S. regulatory authorities to qualify each of the Vessels for operation in the U.S. coastwise on their U.S. Coast Guard ( USCG ) Certificates of Documentation and have and provide to Purchaser all certificates and meet all rules, regulations and requirements of the Classification Society and the Regulatory Bodies (as defined in the REGULATORY BODY REQUIREMENTS Article 11) required for operation of the Vessels in the Trade.  American Bureau of Shipping ("ABS") is the designated Classification Society.  Contractor shall obtain the services of the Classification Society (CS) to review drawings and survey construction, and shall take all other steps necessary or appropriate to obtain and shall obtain classification of the Vessels according to the Classification Society Rules, with notations as required by the Specifications.   

(1)      Contractor will ensure that, as part of its contract with the Classification Society, a Classification Society Program Manager is provided. The Classification Society Program Manager shall be primarily responsible for maintaining a complete and up-to-date awareness of all matters related to classification, statutory certification, and other compliance verification matters for which Classification Society is responsible and for communicating such information to Purchaser and Contractor. Contractor agrees to authorize the Classification Society Program Manager to provide Purchaser with a copy, in English, of submittals and official responses to drawing reviews, procedure reviews, and correspondence when dealing with and rectifying issues related to the Vessel classification, statutory certification, and other compliance verification matters for which Classification Society is responsible   and will authorize the Classification Society to grant visibility privileges to Purchaser and other related project team members through ABS Eagle Construct/Engineering Manager.    In addition,   Contractor   will give written permission for the Classification Society to inform Purchaser and other related project team members, or notify directly under Purchaser s formal request, the

However Purchaser agrees that any meetings or correspondence, whether formal, informal, scheduled or unscheduled held or exchanged with the Classification Society to discuss disputes concerning such matters shall be conducted jointly with Contractor unless otherwise agreed to by Contractor.    Contractor shall, to the extent reasonably within its control, also obligate all other certification, verification, and compliance agents involved in the Vessels to keep the aforesaid Classification Society Program Manager continuously apprised of developments relating to their respective certification, verification, and compliance functions. Contractor shall provide the Classification Society Program Manager with the names and contact information for all such agents. It shall remain Contractor s responsibility to arrange and schedule all necessary attendance with such agents and to ensure compliance with all classification requirements, statutory requirements, and other standards elected under this Contract.   

(2)      Purchaser agrees to accept all interpretations and final rulings issued or made by the Classification Society. In the event Purchaser believes it has discovered materials, appurtenances or Contract Work that does not conform with Class Rules and Contractor does not agree with the view of Purchaser, then the Parties may seek a final ruling from the Classification Society. Contractor shall provide reasonable notice to Purchaser of any meetings with the Classification Society specifically related to the identified non-conformance, and shall authorize the Classification Society to provide to Purchaser all correspondence related to the identified nonconformance, until an interpretation or final ruling is rendered. For issues related to the design of the Vessel, the Chief Surveyor of the Classification Society in Busan, Korea will provide the final ruling of the Classification Society. With respect to issues related to the fabrication, construction and quality of the Vessel, technical survey questions, or exceptions to rules, the local Classification Society representative in San Diego, CA will provide the final ruling of the Classification Society.

As used in this Contract, the term "Substantially Complete" shall mean complete within the requirements of this Contract but for minor items, which are defined by international standard shipbuilding and shipping practices as items that do not substantially affect the commercial utility or safe operation of the Vessel, do not negate or impair the required certifications set forth below, prevent or limit the Vessel from  

3 

trading or violate any material requirements of a Regulatory Body related to the commercial utility or safe operation of the Vessel ( Minor Items ).

7 

(4)      The amount held as security for correction of Deficiencies pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) shall be released from Escrow upon expiration of the Guaranty Period for each Vessel, provided that amounts may be retained in Escrow for correction of Deficiencies reported but not corrected during the Guaranty Period, with the aggregated amount retained in Escrow for each Vessel for such purposes to be mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and Contractor at the time.  Such amounts shall be released from Escrow for each Vessel on a monthly basis for all Deficiencies corrected during the prior month. 

(f)        Adjustments  .  Adjustments shall be made to the Contract Base Price for the purpose of computing milestone payments for the next invoice following the execution of a contract change under CHANGES Article 6 that revises the Contract Base Price.   

(1)      If there has been no agreement as to adjustment of the Contract Base Price resulting from a change, the affected payments shall be paid provisionally based on the Contract Base Price without adjustment and the matter shall be referred for resolution under DISPUTES Article 33.  When disputed adjustments to the Contract Base Price are resolved, Contractor shall promptly refund or Purchaser shall make an appropriate adjustment in subsequent payments to reflect any variance between the amount paid by Purchaser and the final resolution, together with Interest (as defined below) from the date of provisional payment.  

(g)        Withholding of Liquidated Damages  .  In accordance with the provisions of VESSEL PERFORMANCE Article 7 and the DAMAGES FOR DELIVERY Article 9, Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct from amounts payable pursuant to this Article any amount agreed to be due to Purchaser as Liquidated Damages. 

(1)      To the extent that such amount owed by Contractor as Liquidated Damages exceeds the next amount that would otherwise be payable by Purchaser to Contractor under this Article, Contractor shall remit such excess amount promptly to Purchaser. 

(2)      If agreement is not reached on the amount payable pursuant to VESSEL PERFORMANCE Article 7 and DAMAGES FOR DELIVERY Article 9, Purchaser may withhold payment of the total amount claimed by Purchaser from payments of the Contract Price as Liquidated Damages and deposit such amount into the Escrow pending resolution pursuant to the DISPUTES Article 33.  When the disputed amount is resolved, Contractor shall release the agreed or resolved upon amount from Escrow to Purchaser in settlement of the Liquidated Damages issue.  Should the amount deposited into Escrow exceed the agreed or resolved upon amount, Purchaser shall release the excess amount from Escrow in favor of Contractor concurrently with Contractor releasing the agreed or resolved Liquidated Damages amount from Escrow in favor of Purchaser. 

(h)        Withholding Delivery  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, Contractor shall not be obligated to deliver any Vessel until all amounts with respect to such Vessel then due from Purchaser to Contractor have been paid to Contractor or into Escrow, including, without limitation, any amounts claimed by Contractor from Purchaser that remain in dispute, and, failing such payment, the Vessel Contract Delivery Date shall be extended as long as any such amounts are outstanding, without prejudice to Contractor's rights and remedies for nonpayment by Purchaser pursuant to the provisions  

8 

of this Contract, and without triggering any liquidated damages for late Delivery under the DAMAGES FOR DELIVERY Article 9. 

(i)        Interest    Amounts payable by either Party under this Contract, which are not paid into Escrow when due, shall bear interest from the date on which such payment was due, at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate ( Prime Rate ) of interest charged by the Bank of America plus [***]% ( Interest ).   Prime Rate  is the base rate that Bank of America from time to time establishes and that serves as the basis upon which effective rates of interest are calculated for those loans making reference thereto.  Each change in the Prime Rate shall become effective at 12:01 a.m. on the day such change becomes effective.  In the event the Prime Rate is no longer available from Bank of America, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to designate a replacement bank s interest rate to serve as the Prime Rate. 

5                   ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENTS  

(a)      The Contract Base Price is a base price. The Contract Base Price shall be subject to adjustment as described in this Article.  

(b)        Steel  .   

(1)        Definitions and Indices  . For purposes of this Article, "Steel $" shall be defined as the dollar amount of the Contract Base Price identified as "Steel Materials". Economic Price Adjustments for Steel shall be calculated using the American Metal Market (AMM) Monthly Domestic Prices for Carbon Steel Plate Cut to Length ( AMM Index ). The "Current Period" is defined as the 3 month period commencing with the month four months prior to the estimated start of construction milestone as set forth in a notice to Purchaser from Contractor for each Vessel. The "Current Period Index" is defined as the arithmetic average of the monthly values of the AMM Index published for the Current Period. The Base Price Index is $[***] per hundred pounds, or centum weight ($/cwt), which is the value of the AMM Index [***], the price used to calculate Steel $ and the Base Contract Price at the time this Contract was formed.  

(2)        Computation  . For each Vessel, an Economic Price Adjustment for Steel shall be computed using the following formula:  

Steel $ [***] ((Current Period Index   Base Price Index)   Base Price Index).  

(3)        Invoicing and Payment of Economic Price Adjustment  . At 30 days prior to the start of construction of each Vessel, Contractor shall compute the Economic Price Adjustment for such Vessel.  If a positive adjustment results, Contractor shall invoice Purchaser, and Purchaser shall pay such adjustment within ten business days of Contractor's invoice.  If a negative adjustment results, Contractor shall credit such adjustment for prior Milestone payments against the next Milestone payment(s) to be invoiced to Purchaser.

7                   VESSEL PERFORMANCE  

(a)        Vessel Key Performance Requirements, Verification and Penalties  .  While each Vessel, upon Delivery, is required to meet the requirements of this Contract, subject to the POST-TRIAL INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE Article 18, certain Key Performance Requirements are deemed to be fundamental to the Vessel s commercial utility and value to Purchaser.  Contractor shall verify each Vessel s compliance with the Key Performance Requirements of this Article in accordance with the test and trials methodologies detailed in the Specifications.  Such verification shall include the extent to which the Vessel fails to meet, meets, or exceeds the Key Performance Requirements.  If any Vessel's performance does not meet any of the Key Performance Requirements, Purchaser will suffer damages that are difficult to determine.  By way of limitation of Contractor s liability for such failure, and in lieu of actual damages and all other remedies of Purchaser for such failure, the Contract Base Price shall be adjusted downward as set forth in this Article.   

(1)        Service Speed Requirement and Verification  : The  Service Speed  of the Vessel at the design draft of 11.5 meters ( m ) on even keel shall be 23.0 knots with the main engine running at [***]% of its maximum continuous rating ( MCR ) (at [***] kW with [***]% sea margin). Speed shall be measured during sea trials at a ballast draft condition and with the trial data corrected for wind, waves, swell, and Vessel bottom cleanliness in accordance with the Specifications and other conditions stated herein. Service Speed shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of a knot with the Main Engine Operating at [***]% MCR ([***] kW) with [***]% sea margin.  Early in the design process ship model tests shall be conducted to refine the hull form in order to confirm the Vessel s predicted service speed for the range of operating drafts and trims defined in the Specifications.  [***]  Vessel 1 verification results for Service Speed shall be extended to subsequent Vessels where there have been no changes to the hull form, loading, ballast or trim conditions or changes to the Vessel components that would affect Service Speed.  Service Speed trials for Vessel 1, and each subsequent Vessel for which verification is required as a result of a Change, shall be conducted and measured utilizing the following procedural practices: 

11 

1.     The sea trial speed test shall be conducted in water with a depth greater than 100m and at a deep ballast draft corresponding to the model tests.  

2.     Weather and sea conditions shall be Beaufort 3 or less. 

3.     Assessment of the distance traveled for determining the performance speed shall be conducted by means of DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System).    

4.     The influence of rudder helm during the test shall be minimized in accordance with the standards set forth in International Standards Organization (ISO) 15016  Ships and Marine Technology   Guidelines for the Assessment of Speed and Power Performance by Analysis of Speed Trial Data.  

5.     The speed trial shall consist of runs in alternate directions at each of four power levels defined in the Contract Specifications. 

6.     Results of speed trial shall be corrected to calm water (no wind, no waves, no current) according to ISO 15016  Ships and Marine Technology   Guidelines for the Assessment of Speed and Power Performance by Analysis of Speed Trial Data . 

(i)  Where performance does not meet requirements:  No liquidated damages shall be payable for the first [***] knots less than [***] knots; $[***] for each of the [***] knot increments less than [***] knots; and $[***] for each of the [***] knot increments less than [***] knots. Service Speed shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of a knot. 

(2)        Main Engine Fuel Consumption Requirement and Verification  :  The specific fuel consumption rate in fuel oil mode for each Vessel s main diesel engines shall not exceed [***] grams/kilowatt-hour (g/kW-h) with an allowance of [***]% at [***]% Maximum Continuous Rating (MCR) in Tier III mode, [***] kW at [***] RPM, as defined in the Specifications. All calorific values to be corrected to ISO standards.  The specific fuel consumption rate is defined using fuel oil with lower caloric value of [***] kJ/kg and International Standards Organization (ISO) 3046/1-2002(E) conditions, Ambient Air Temp [***] degrees Celsius, Blower Inlet Pressure [***] mbar (measured at shop test bed).  Vessel 1 verification results shall be extended to subsequent  Vessels where there have been no configuration changes to the Vessel or equipment and material that would impact performance for the Main Engine Fuel Consumption.  Fractions of 1% shall be rounded to the nearest 1%. 

(i)  Where performance does not meet requirements:  No liquidated damages shall be due for the first [***]% of specific fuel oil consumption rate above [***] g/kW/h.  Liquidated damages shall be due in the amount of $[***] for each [***]% of specific fuel oil consumption in excess of the above fuel consumption rate up to $[***].  If the fuel consumption rate is [***]% in excess of the specified fuel oil consumption rate of [***] grams/kilowatt-hour, the amount of liquidated damages shall be $[***].  Fractions of 1% are to be rounded to the nearest 1%. 

(4)        Homogenous Container Capacity Requirement and Verification  :    The number of loadable containers with [***] per TEU shall be 2,750 TEUs at the design  

12 

draft of 11.5 m in accordance with the Westbound condition as described in Section 115 of the Specifications and calculated based on the conditions detailed for loadable container capacity in that section.  All containers (except 20 s which shall be 8 6  high) in holds and on deck shall be assumed as 9 -6  high for this calculation.   The stowage locations for the loadable containers shall be verified in accordance with Sections 238 and 314.1 of the Specifications by testing each container fitting location in a manner consistent with Contractor s standard practices and verifying fitting installation to dimensional tolerances outlined in the Specification and the Class Rules and Guidelines.  

(i)   Where performance does not meet requirements: Purchaser has the option to receive $[***] for each TEU below [***] TEU. 

(b)        Vessel Adjustments  .  In lieu of the Contract Base Price Adjustments specified in paragraph (a) of this Article, and provided Contractor conforms to the requirements of the Specifications and  the General Arrangement, Contractor shall have the right, at its own expense, at any time prior to Delivery, to make reasonable adjustments or modifications to any Vessel to cause such Vessel to meet the Key Performance Requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this Article, provided Contractor shall obtain any required Regulatory Body approval for such adjustments or modifications and approval of Purchaser, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Any such changes shall be documented in a CPF indicating the specific changes at no cost to Purchaser and no delay to delivery. 

(c)        Effect of Changes  .  The Key Performance Requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this Article are based on the Vessels as described and delineated in the Specifications, and such Requirements shall be changed to take into account any Contract Work change required or approved pursuant to the CHANGES Article 6 only to the extent set forth in a CPF.  Contractor shall promptly notify Purchaser if Contractor believes that any changes in the Regulatory Requirements under REGULATORY BODY REQUIREMENTS Article 11 may require a change to the Key Performance Requirements and the Parties will endeavor to agree as to any changes to this Article. 

(d)        Disagreements  .  If either Party claims a Contract Base Price adjustment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Article, and if there is disagreement as to any such proposed adjustment, Contractor or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall deposit the disputed amount in Escrow and such amount shall be released to Purchaser or Contractor as subsequently agreed upon or resolved pursuant to DISPUTES Article 33. 

8                   FORCE MAJEURE 

(a)        Force Majeure  .  Any delays in, or failure of performance by, either Purchaser or Contractor shall not constitute a default under this Contract or give rise to any claim for damages if, and to the extent, any such delay or failure of performance is caused by the occurrence of Force Majeure.  The term  Force Majeure  shall mean any cause (hereinafter the  Force Majeure Cause(s) ), whatsoever beyond the reasonable control and without the fault of the Party claiming Force Majeure, excluding any such causes that are in existence as of the date of execution of this Contract, or, as to a cause impacting a subcontractor, a cause that is actually known to Contractor or to the party or parties to the subcontract as of the date of execution of the subcontract.  The Party  

13 

claiming Force Majeure must be unable to mitigate or prevent through commercially reasonable efforts the Force Majeure Cause(s); and the Parties acknowledge and agree that neither Party shall be required to incur commercially unreasonable costs in its efforts to mitigate or prevent such Force Majeure Causes.  Force Majeure shall include, without limitation or prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, delay caused by any Regulatory Body whose approvals or documents are required under this Contract, including delay caused by different or inconsistent interpretations of governing rules or regulations; Government priorities; civil, naval or military authorities; import or export restrictions; delay caused by the US Government or any other government acting in its capacity as sovereign; interruption or curtailment of utility services; Acts of God (including hurricanes, earthquakes, lightning, floods or extraordinarily severe wind or weather, but excluding ordinary storms and inclement weather conditions); strikes, sympathy strikes, or other industrial disturbances; explosions, fires, and vandalism; riots, insurrections, acts or threats of terrorism, sabotage, blockades, embargoes, and epidemics; material shortages of skilled workers provided that Contractor has exercised diligence in the recruitment and training of labor; Force Majeure delays in other contracts being performed by Contractor, where such delay results from causes herein described that also delay the construction of any Vessel; delays by land, sea or air carriers; the unavailability or late delivery to Contractor of machinery, equipment and supplies which this Contract requires be incorporated in the Vessels, provided that at the time of ordering the same could reasonably be expected by Contractor to be delivered on time, Contractor s choice of the vendor was reasonable and Contractor has exercised due diligence to monitor the actions and to expedite delivery by the vendor or to obtain substitute performance; and, the late performance or default of a supplier, provided that Contractor s choice of the supplier was reasonable and responsible at the time of supplier selection and Contractor exercised reasonable efforts in managing its suppliers.  

(b)        Notification of Claim  .  When a Force Majeure event becomes known by Contractor or Purchaser, the Party claiming Force Majeure shall promptly notify the other Party in writing and no longer than 25 days after knowledge has come to the Party.  Such notice shall include, as may be practical, an estimate of the impact of Force Majeure on the Vessel Contract Delivery Date for any affected Vessel and the proposed recovery plan.  The Party claiming a Force Majeure event shall provide updates every 14 days to report the status when such event continues to potentially delay Delivery for a period that exceeds 21 days from the start of the impact.  Failure of the Party to provide notification of any claim for Force Majeure within such 25 days shall be deemed to be a waiver by the Party of its right to propose such Force Majeure. 

(c)        Force Majeure Extension  .  Either Party may request an extension of the relevant Vessel Contract Delivery Date by a number of days not to exceed the number of days that the Vessel Contract Delivery Date was delayed by Force Majeure.

As soon as practicable after a Force Majeure cause of delay has ceased to exist, the Party claiming Force Majeure shall furnish to the other Party a detailed written statement of the proposed delay in the Vessel Contract Delivery Dates resulting from such cause for any affected Vessel along with a recovery plan.  When the amount of a Force Majeure delay has been agreed to, the Parties shall execute a Contract Change in accordance with the CHANGES Article 6 to adjust the Vessel  

14 

Contract Delivery Dates.  If the Parties are unable to resolve either the existence or magnitude of a Force Majeure delay within a reasonable period of time, resolution shall be made in accordance with the DISPUTES Article 33.  The burden of proof in such disputes shall be on the Party claiming Force Majeure. 

9                   DAMAGES FOR DELIVERY 

(a)        Damages for Delays  .  If Contractor fails to deliver any Vessel more than [***] days after its Vessel Contract Delivery Date, Purchaser will suffer damages that are difficult to determine.  Contractor shall pay to Purchaser Liquidated Damages in lieu of actual damages, not as a penalty, and as a complete limitation of Contractor s liability for late Delivery.  Liquidated damages shall accrue for each Vessel at the rate of $[***] per day for each day elapsing after [***] days past the Vessel Contract Delivery Date.  Liquidated damages shall cease to accrue upon the date of Delivery of the Vessel, which day shall not count for accrual of liquidated damages. 

(b)        Limitation of Liquidated Damages  .  The total liability of Contractor for delay in Delivery of any Vessel shall not exceed Liquidated Damages payable for [***] days of delay beyond the initial grace period of [***] days, or $[***].

Contractor agrees that any such monetary payments to Purchaser shall not otherwise impact Contractor s Guaranty obligations or void suppliers  warranties if any. 

19                  GUARANTY AND LIMITATION OF CONTRACTOR'S AND PURCHASER S LIABILITIES 

(a)        Guaranty.    Contractor guarantees each Vessel for a period of 12 months from its date of Delivery ( Guaranty Period ) against all Deficiencies (as defined in the POST-TRIAL INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE Article 18) that are discovered and reported to Contractor prior to the expiration of the Guaranty Period.  Contractor s sole responsibility in the event of such a Deficiency shall be to repair or replace, in Contractor s sole discretion, all Deficiencies at Contractor s cost, such that the equipment on which such Deficiency exists is brought in to proper working order.  In computing the Guaranty Period, there shall be excluded any time that the Vessel is prevented from entering or is taken out of service solely on account of any Deficiency as mutually agreed to by the Parties or as determined in accordance with DISPUTES Article 33.  This guaranty shall not extend to expected ordinary wear and tear, natural events, nor to the extent that the Deficiency was caused or aggravated by the negligence or other improper act of any third party not acting for Contractor, including Purchaser or the Vessel operator.  This guaranty shall not extend to items furnished by Purchaser, but it shall extend to damage to items furnished by Purchaser caused by Contractor s improper handling, storage, or installation of such items, when such handling, storage, or installation was not in conformance with the instructions provided by Purchaser pursuant to paragraph (b) of the ITEMS FURNISHED BY PURCHASER Article 16, such nonconformance to be determined by Contractor subject to objection by Purchaser under the DISPUTES Article 33. 

(b)        Further Guaranty  .  Contractor guarantees the workmanship and material of the repairs or replacements made under the guaranty in paragraph (a) of this Article for a further period of 90 days from the date of completion of such repair or replacement, or  

26 

to the end of the Guaranty Period, whichever is later, and, if necessary, this further period shall be further extended for an additional 90 days if the Deficiency requires additional repair, replacement or re-performance. 

(c)        Assignment of Subcontractor and Vendor Guarantees  .  Upon expiration of the Guaranty Period, Contractor shall assign to Purchaser all rights and privileges of Contractor in any extended guarantees and warranties provided by subcontractors, equipment suppliers and vendors of equipment and materials, if any, used in construction of the Vessel.  Such assignments shall not alter or extend Contractor's responsibilities and guarantees. 

(d)        Notification of Deficiencies  .  Purchaser shall notify Contractor in writing as soon as practicable, and in any event no more than ten business days after discovery of any Deficiency falling within the provisions of this Article.  Purchaser s notice shall include such particulars as can reasonably be given as to the nature and extent of such Deficiency, the applicable Specifications or Regulatory Requirement, the date of discovery, the location of the Vessel, and the place at which the Vessel can be made available for earliest inspection by or on behalf of Contractor.  As soon as practicable, Purchaser also shall furnish to Contractor copies of relevant survey or inspection reports. 

(e)        Contractor s Inspection  .  Upon receipt of notice of a Deficiency under paragraph (d) of this Article, Contractor may (but shall not be bound to) arrange for inspection of the Vessel on its own behalf at its own cost.  If such an inspection is undertaken, Purchaser shall make the Vessel s officers, crew members, log books, and any other relevant documents and information available to Contractor s representative at the inspection.  Contractor may, from time-to-time, request a subcontractor or supplier representative inspect an item that is the subject of the notice of a Deficiency.  Purchaser shall provide the same support and information to Contractor s subcontractor or supplier for such inspection. 

(f)        Correction of Deficiencies  .   

(i)      Purchaser, in consultation with Contractor, shall designate a reasonable time and location suitable for correction of Deficiencies.  At Purchaser s sole risk and expense, Purchaser then shall cause the Vessel to be available to Contractor at such time and location, ready in all respects for the corrective action [***]. At all times during Contractor's correction of Deficiencies under this Article, Purchaser shall retain full care, custody and control of the Vessel. 

(ii)      Contractor shall arrange for the correction of Deficiencies and performance of any essential dismantling and reassembling at the designated location at its own expense, including transportation costs of necessary parts, machinery or equipment and all costs of attendance of suppliers' technical representatives.  Any parts, machinery or equipment replaced shall on their removal become the property of, and shall be disposed of at the risk of, Contractor.  Replacement parts, machinery or equipment installed in the Vessel shall upon installation and satisfactory testing become the property of Purchaser. 

(iii)      Purchaser shall be responsible for placing the Vessel and its equipment in proper condition for the correction of Deficiencies (e.g., emptying fluids from  

27 

tanks and piping, isolation of piping and other systems) except as is the responsibility of Contractor under subparagraph (i) and cessation of Vessel operations as necessary to allow Contractor ready access to any Deficiency. 

(iv)      If a Deficiency cannot reasonably be corrected except by drydocking the Vessel, Purchaser shall be entitled to postpone correction and repair until a subsequent drydocking of the Vessel.  $[***] shall be withheld from the Guaranty Payment until the first drydocking, or if larger, the estimated cost of correction and repair, or to be part of a monetary settlement. 

(v)      If a Deficiency can be repaired without taking the Vessel out of service, Purchaser shall promptly advise Contractor of the nature of the Deficiency and Contractor may elect to send its personnel or hire a subcontractor to be sent to the Vessel to make the repairs.  If Contractor does not so elect, and Contractor confirms that under the warranty the repairs may be completed by the Vessel crew or a Purchaser s subcontractor, Purchaser may have the Vessel crew or a subcontractor perform the repairs and bill Contractor for costs reasonably incurred for correcting such Deficiency, provided, however, that: 

A.  Purchaser follows all manufacturer/OEM Technical and Installation Manual work instructions for replacement and correction; and 

B.  Purchaser submits a detailed claim in the format mutually specified between the Parties describing in detail the deficient condition or operation of the equipment as well as the documentation of correction per the Technical Manual(s) noted above suitable  for Contractor s use in submitting a subsequent claim to the OEM; and 

C.  Material replaced is discrete, identifiable, on hand in ship or depot stores and requires no specialized troubleshooting to correct; and 

D.  Purchaser returns deficient material to Contractor, at Contractor s expense, for subsequent analysis and inspection. 

(g)        Emergency Correction  .  Prior to the expiration of the Guaranty Period, should any Deficiencies reasonably require emergency correction outside the Vessel s normal maintenance schedule, whether or not such Deficiencies require the Vessel to be dry-docked, upon written notice of the need for emergency repairs pursuant to paragraph (i) below and concurrence by Contractor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Contractor shall pay the actual costs of correcting the Deficiencies reasonably incurred by Purchaser. 

(i)      Prior to performing any such emergency correction of Deficiencies, Purchaser shall notify Contractor in writing of the nature of the Deficiency, the reason that emergency correction is required, and the nature of the intended correction work. 

28 

(ii)      When the Vessel is taken to a facility or dry-docked solely for the purpose of correcting a Deficiency, the costs chargeable to Contractor s account shall be limited to those costs reasonably incurred for correcting such Deficiency at such facility, including dry docking for correction of such Deficiency.  If any other work is performed for Purchaser other than by Contractor while the Vessel is at such repair facility or in such dry dock, Purchaser shall pay a proportional share of dry docking expenses (if such other work requires dry-docking) and all additional expenses for such work completed by a party other than Contractor, its agents or subcontractors.  All port charges, tug charges, moorage, wharfage, and fire and security watches incidental to the Vessel at the repair location shall be apportioned based on the invoiced work performed by the repair facility for the respective Parties.

(ii)      In the event Contractor sells a Vessel, Contractor thereafter shall repay to Purchaser (if the amount below is positive), without Interest, an amount equal to (X) minus (Y), where:

40 

Provided however, (i) that if the amount determined by subtracting (Y) from (X) above is a negative number, Purchaser shall pay such amount to Contractor; and (ii) that in no event will Contractor repay to Purchaser more than the value of (X) as defined in this Article. 

(iii)      In the event that Contractor elects to complete any Vessel, Contractor may negotiate the revival of this Contract with Purchaser at any time before the sale of the Vessel upon Purchaser s providing evidence satisfactory to Contractor that the events causing Purchaser s default have been remedied. 

(2)        Abandonment of Construction  .  Contractor may terminate this Contract and thereafter may abandon construction of any Vessel and sell such Vessel in its state of completion at the time of abandonment of construction.

(Y)   the sum of: 

(A) One hundred twelve percent of Contractor s costs incurred in the Contract Work to the date of the abandonment of construction, plus 

(B) such other costs, charges, expenses and damages as Contractor may have incurred as a result of the default of Purchaser, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by Contractor in making such termination and abandonment, minus  

(C) the proceeds of any sale of the Vessel in its state of completion as of the time of abandonment of construction and the reasonable value of any part thereof that remains unsold.  

Provided however, (i) that, if the amount determined by subtracting (Y) from (X) above is a negative number, Purchaser shall pay such amount to Contractor; and (ii) that in no event will Contractor repay to Purchaser more than the value of (X) as defined in this Article. 

(ii)      In connection with any such abandonment and sale, all liens and security interests of Purchaser in the Collateral (as defined in Article 27) shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect and Purchaser hereby authorizes Contractor to file all documents necessary to evidence the release such liens  

41 

in the Collateral (and by its acceptance of any assignment of the security interest in the Collateral, any assignee of Purchaser agrees to such automatic release of liens and the filing of termination statements evidencing the same). 

(3)        Transfer of Purchaser s Rights Under This Contract  .  Contractor may amend, transfer and assign Purchaser s right, title and interest in and to this Contract, including the right to receive Delivery of and transfer title to the Vessels upon their Delivery, to a third party that will perform and assume all of Purchaser s obligations under this Contract as so amended, transferred or assigned, such amendment, transfer and assignment to be in accordance with provisions of this paragraph (b) (3) and otherwise in accordance with applicable law. 

(i)      Purchaser hereby appoints Contractor as its Attorney-in-Fact to take all actions necessary or reasonably incidental thereto to effect the amendment, transfer and assignment of this Contract to Contractor or its designee(s) (any such amendment, assignment or transfer, an  Assignment ). 

(ii)      Any Assignment entered into in accordance with this paragraph (b) (3) may only be effected following the consummation of an amendment, transfer or assignment process conducted in all respects in a commercially reasonable manner in accordance with applicable law, and upon consummation of any such Assignment and the payment of the proceeds referenced below to Purchaser, the transferee shall be entitled to all rights and benefits of this Contract and Purchaser shall not have any further interests or rights in and to this Contract as so amended by the Assignment. 

(iii)      Contractor shall deliver written notice to Purchaser of its intent to pursue an assignment of this Contract in accordance with terms of this paragraph (b)(3) of this Article (the  Assignment Notice ).   

(iv)      Contractor will immediately use those proceeds of the Assignment (which Contractor receives from time to time) that are allocable to the work in process for any undelivered Vessels to pay to Purchaser (if the amount is positive), without Interest, an amount equal to: 

(X)   all initial and progress payments already paid by Purchaser for any undelivered Vessels (plus the value of any other equipment or materials of Purchaser in accordance with paragraph (a) of Article 27) less 

(Y)   the sum of: 

(A) such other costs, charges, expenses and damages as Contractor may have incurred as a result of the event of default, and 

(B) the difference between the Contract Price for any undelivered Vessels as of the date of the event of default and the Contract Price for such undelivered Vessels set forth in such Assignment (as in effect on the initial date thereof); 

provided however, (i) that if the amount referenced in (B) is less than zero, the value of (B) shall be assumed as zero; and (ii) that if the amount determined by subtracting (Y) from (X) above is a negative number, Purchaser shall pay such amount to Contractor;  

42 

and (iii) that in no event will Contractor repay to Purchaser more than the value of (X) as defined in this Article.    

(iii)      Nothing contained in this paragraph (b)(3), shall prohibit Contractor at any time prior to any such Assignment from terminating this Contract and pursuing its remedies under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this Article.

(c)        Rights and Remedies Not Exclusive  .  The rights conferred upon Contractor under the terms of this Article are several and shall not be exclusive of any other remedies in law or equity that might be otherwise available to Contractor upon the happening of the events of default specified in herein.  The failure of Contractor to exercise any of the rights conferred upon it hereunder with respect to any default of Purchaser shall not constitute a waiver of any rights of Contractor with respect to any other events of default of Purchaser hereunder.  If any such right is unenforceable, all other rights and remedies shall remain. 

26                 DEFAULT OF CONTRACTOR AND PURCHASER S REMEDIES

(x) Guarantor shall in any manner reject its obligations under the guaranty agreement provided to Purchaser or assign the guaranty agreement without Purchaser s prior written consent. 

Contractor hereby appoints Purchaser as its Attorney-in-Fact following the occurrence of any one or more of the events of default specified above to take all actions necessary or desirable to effect Purchaser s rights and remedies as described below. 

(b)        Rights and Remedies  .  In the event of the occurrence of any one or more of the events of default specified in paragraph (a) of this Article 26, upon payment of any unpaid costs by Purchaser up to the date of default, which is not contested by Contractor, or, which if contested, is resolved in Purchaser s favor under DISPUTES Article 33, then Purchaser may, at its election, terminate this Contract on written notice to Contractor and exercise its rights below.   

(1)        Completion of Vessel  .  In the event of termination of this Contract, Purchaser may proceed, or have its designee proceed, to have the Contract Work on any Vessel completed and for such purpose, subject to the rights of other purchasers of other vessels to be constructed by Contractor and subject to the rights and obligations of Contractor with respect thereto, Purchaser may take possession and use and occupy so much of the Shipyard, plant equipment, tools, machinery, and appliances as may be needed for such purposes, without the payment of any rental or other charge therefore to Contractor, excepting, however, an equitable allocation of Contractor s overhead costs. If Purchaser or its designee performs work at Contractor s Shipyard, they agree to abide by all applicable safety, environmental and security rules and regulations. 

(i)      Contractor hereby agrees to assure to Purchaser or its designee such use and occupancy of the said facilities and said other property of Contractor for such period of time as reasonably may be necessary for the completion of the Contract Work. 

44 

(ii)      Contractor shall: 

(A) assign to Purchaser such subcontracts and orders for material, services and supplies, including without limitation (to the extent Contractor is legally able to), all ownership and/or licensee rights in any software, drawings and technology, whether in hard copy or electronic format, as are identified to the Contract Work and to be used in the performance of said Contract Work as Purchaser may direct; and 

(B) pay to Purchaser the amount by which the total cost to Purchaser of completing said Contract Work (including all amounts paid to Contractor hereunder) exceeds the total Contract Price provided in this Contract, as adjusted hereunder, provided, however, that in computing the amount, if any, to be paid by Contractor to Purchaser, appropriate adjustment shall be made for changes to the Contract Work subsequent to the termination of the Contract. 

(2)        Sale of Incomplete Vessel  .  In the event of termination of this Contract, and if Purchaser shall elect not to complete any Vessel or Vessels, Purchaser, at any time within [***] days from the date of termination hereunder, may sell any partially completed Vessel or Vessels, work-in-process, material, articles of machinery, outfit and equipment and supplies, together with the Specifications and Design Products (to the extent Contractor is legally able to). Purchaser shall be bound in good faith to secure the best price obtainable under the circumstances. 

(i)      Any purchaser at any such sale shall be given reasonable time, not less than 60 days from the date of sale, within which to remove from the Shipyard any Vessel, work-in-process, material, articles of machinery, outfit, equipment and supplies purchased. 

(ii)      The proceeds of the sale shall be applied: 

First, to payment of all reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by Purchaser or its assigns in making such sale; 

Second, to reimbursement of Purchaser for payments theretofore made by Purchaser to Contractor on account of the Vessel sold; and, 

Third, to payment of any damages, demands or deficiencies arising by reason of default of Contractor.  The remaining proceeds, if any, shall belong to Purchaser. 

In the event the proceeds of the sale shall not be sufficient to pay the first, second and third items, as above set forth, the difference shall be paid to Purchaser by Contractor. 

(3)        Right to Remove  :  In the event Purchaser shall elect to terminate this Contract, at Purchaser's option Purchaser may elect in writing within [***] days after the termination of this Contract to remove the work in process from the Shipyard.  The preparation for such removal will be performed at Contractor's cost and expense.  The cost for the actual removal will be at Purchaser s expense.  Contractor shall assign to Purchaser all existing subcontracts and purchase orders required to complete the Vessel for which the work in process is being removed as Purchaser may direct. 

(4)        Refund  .  In the event any one or more of the events of default specified in paragraph (a) of this Article 26 occurs prior to start of construction of the first  

45 

Vessel, Purchaser may elect to obtain a refund.  If Purchaser elects to obtain a refund, Contractor shall promptly refund to Purchaser the full amount of all sums paid by Purchaser to Contractor on account of the Vessel. Upon such refund by Contractor to Purchaser, all obligations duties and liabilities of each of the parties hereto to the other under this Contract shall be forthwith completely discharged.  Provided that if Contractor proceeds to dispute resolution under the provisions of DISPUTES Article 33 hereof, the amount to be refunded shall be determined as provided in Article 33. For the avoidance of doubt, if Purchaser elects to receive a refund, Contractor may enter into a contract for the construction of the Vessels with another party. 

(c)        Rights and Remedies Not Exclusive  .  The rights conferred upon Purchaser under the terms of this Article are several and shall not be exclusive of any other remedies in law or equity that might be otherwise available to Purchaser upon the happening of the events of default specified in herein.  The failure of Purchaser to exercise any of the rights conferred upon it hereunder with respect to any default of Contractor shall not constitute a waiver of any rights of Purchaser with respect to any other events of default of Contractor hereunder.  If any such right is unenforceable, all other rights and remedies shall remain. 

27                 TITLE, RISK OF LOSS, AND PROPERTY INTERESTS  

(a)        Title  .  Title to each Vessel, and to the material and equipment to be incorporated into each Vessel (except material furnished by Purchaser), shall remain with Contractor until Delivery of each Vessel. 

(b)        Security Interests  . To secure all Contractor s obligations to Purchaser under this Contract, Contractor hereby grants to Purchaser a first priority lien on and security interest in each Vessel, and to all the Contract Work, and all material, inventory and equipment to be installed in or placed on board a Vessel, for use in the performance of the Contract Work whether at the Shipyard or located elsewhere and the Specifications, Vessel Drawings and Design Products.  

(c)        Scrap and Surplus Material  .  Title to all scrap and to any material and equipment that is surplus to the requirements of this Contract (except material and equipment furnished by Purchaser) shall remain with Contractor. 

(d)        Loss  .  Except as may otherwise be provided in this Contract, the risk of loss or damage to each of the Vessels and to all material and equipment located at the Shipyard and elsewhere, but excluding Purchaser furnished materials not yet delivered to Contractor, and shall remain with Contractor until Delivery of each Vessel.   

28                  LIENS  

(a)        Contractor s Responsibility to Resolve  .  At the time Contractor requests any payment under the provisions of this Contract, Contractor shall furnish to Purchaser a certificate in the form of Exhibit E executed by Contractor certifying freedom of Liens of  

46 

the Vessel and any property aboard any Vessel or any Contract Work or any material at the Shipyard or elsewhere (including material furnished by Purchaser) related to the performance of the Contract Work (provided such property and material are intended to be incorporated into a Vessel but regardless of whether such property or material have yet to be incorporated in a Vessel) , excepting, however, those in favor of Purchaser arising out of its security interest or title created herein, or a claimant, other than Contractor and Contractor s subcontractors, arising out of acts or omissions of Purchaser.  Contractor shall grant no Liens of any kind in any Vessel or any property or material incorporated or intended to be incorporated in any Vessel, or any Contractor Work and Contractor shall take all actions required to the end that no Liens, of any kind arising out of the Contract Work, or on account of any claim against Contractor or against any subcontractor of Contractor performing work or furnishing material under this Contract, or arising out of any agreement to which Contractor or Guarantor is a party, shall be perfected against or upon any of the Vessels any portions thereof or any of said property, material or Contract Work at any time from and after the Effective Date.  If a Lien of any kind is perfected against, or if there is any attachment upon, a Vessel or any of said property, material or Contract Work, Contractor shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof. 

(1)      If such Lien does not arise out of acts or omissions of Purchaser, Contractor shall, not later than [***] days after the Lien is created, secure the discharge or release of such Lien provided, however, that Contractor may contest such Lien or the claim upon which it is based, and shall within the time herein provided secure the discharge or release of such Lien by court order, and, if required, shall file such bond or security as the court shall require. 

(2)      If release or discharge is not available under the law, Contractor shall immediately take such steps as shall prevent such claimed Lien from delaying the Contract Work and shall indemnify and save harmless Purchaser from all costs, charges, and damages by reason of such claimed Lien or claims or in any way attributable thereto. 

(b)        Purchaser s Right to Resolve  .  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Article, except with respect to matters being or proposed to be contested promptly in good faith by Contractor, Purchaser may secure the discharge or release of such Lien in which event Contractor shall reimburse Purchaser for its costs of securing such discharge or release (which cost shall include any reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney s fees, incurred in connection therewith) by deducting such sum from any payments due or to become due Contractor under this Contract.  In the event such cost is in excess of the amount of any such reimbursement by deductions, Contractor shall pay the amount of such excess to Purchaser upon demand. 

(c)        Purchaser s Right to Withhold Payment  .  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Article, Purchaser, without securing the discharge or release of such Lien as provided in paragraph (b) of this Article, may nevertheless withhold from any payments due or to become due Contractor, unless and until such claimed Lien is released or discharged by Contractor, a sum equal to the amount reasonably determined by Purchaser to be required to secure the release or discharge of such Lien which amount may include the reasonably estimated amount of all expenses, including reasonable attorney s fees, which might be incurred therewith. 

47 

29                  TAXES AND DUTIES 

(a)        Taxes and Duties Included in Contract Price  .  Except as excluded by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Article, the Contract Price includes, and Contractor shall pay when due, all United States, state, county, city and all other taxes, assessments and duties of every kind lawfully assessed or levied against or with respect to each Vessel and any material, supplies, or equipment used in the performance of this Contract in connection with such Vessel (excepting, however, material, supplies and equipment furnished to Contractor by Purchaser) to the extent such taxes, assessments and duties are assessed or levied (i) prior to Delivery; or (ii) with respect to any period preceding or ending with Delivery.  Contractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold Purchaser harmless from liability from the aforesaid United States, state, county, city and all other taxes, assessments and duties with respect to each Vessel and any materials, supplies, or equipment used in performance of this Contract. 

(b)        Sales, Use and Excise Taxes Excluded  .  The Contract Price expressly excludes all sales, use or other excise taxes payable by reason of transfer of such Vessel to Purchaser or by reason of Purchaser's use thereof, and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Contractor harmless from liability for any such sales, use or other excise taxes.  To the extent that there is a dispute with a taxing authority over the amount of sales, use or other excise taxes payable by reason of the transfer of such Vessel to Purchaser or by reason of Purchaser s use thereof, Purchaser shall pay for and control the resolution of such dispute (including cases in which Contractor is a Party to such dispute). 

(c)        New Taxes and Duties Excluded  .  The Contract Price expressly excludes all United States, state, county, city and all other taxes, assessments and duties with respect to each Vessel and any materials, supplies, or equipment used in the performance of this Contract that were not in effect on the Effective Date ("New Taxes and Duties").  To the extent New Taxes and Duties are imposed upon and paid by Contractor, Purchaser and Contractor shall execute a Contract Change in accordance with the CHANGES Article 6 to compensate Contractor for the cost of such New Taxes and Duties.  New Taxes and Duties shall not include a change in the amount or rate of a tax or duty in effect on the Effective Date, but shall include a change in law or change in interpretation of an existing tax or duty becoming applicable to any Vessel or to any materials, supplies or equipment used in the performance of this Contract. 

30                  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT  

Contractor shall be responsible for any and all claims against Purchaser or against any Vessel for infringement of patents, patent rights, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets in the design, construction, use, or sale of any Vessel as constructed by Contractor (excepting claims arising out of equipment or machinery supplied to Contractor by Purchaser or the use or sale thereof), and Contractor shall defend, save harmless and indemnify Purchaser and the Vessel against all such claims and against all reasonable costs, expenses, charges and damages which Purchaser or any Vessel may be obligated to pay by reason thereof, including expenses of litigation, if any, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to inventions covered by applications for United States Letter Patent which, during the performance of this Contract, are being maintained in secrecy,  

48 

under the provisions of 35 U.S.C., Sections 181-188, and which are not known lawfully by Contractor, nor shall Contractor be obligated to indemnify Purchaser for any infringement of United States Letters Patent or other intellectual property rights resulting from compliance by Contractor with specific written instructions of Purchaser given subsequent to the Effective Date relating to patent matters, or to indemnify Purchaser for an infringement of United States Letters Patent or other intellectual property rights resulting from the use or disposition of material, equipment or other items furnished to Contractor by Purchaser, provided that, upon any such claim being made against Purchaser or a Vessel or any notice thereof, Contractor shall be notified promptly in writing of such claim and also of any suit brought in connection therewith and shall be given an opportunity to defend the same; and provided, further, that so long as Contractor has confirmed in writing its indemnification obligation hereunder and is defending such claim actively and diligently, no payment on account of any such claim shall be made by Purchaser unless made with the consent of Contractor or pursuant to the decree of a proper court or tribunal.  If an intellectual property infringement claim is initiated, or, in Contractor s reasonable opinion, is likely to be initiated, then Contractor shall, at its sole option and expense: (1) modify or replace the infringing part of such Vessel so that it is no longer infringing, provided that the functionality of the foregoing does not change in any material adverse respect, and reimburse Purchaser for any out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Purchaser in connection with such modification or replacement; (2) procure for Purchaser the right to continue using the infringing part of a Vessel; or (3) with Purchaser s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, if using commercially reasonable efforts, Contractor can neither acquire the right to continue using nor replace or modify the infringing part of a Vessel in accordance with this Article, then remove the infringing part of a Vessel and refund to Purchaser the amount paid by Purchaser for the infringing portion removed from a Vessel.  The foregoing intellectual property infringement indemnification obligation shall not apply when: (i) the infringement is a direct result of a modification made to a Vessel and the modification was not authorized in writing by Contractor where  but for  the modification the patent infringement claim would not occur or would not have occurred; or (ii) the infringement resulted from Contractor complying with a specific instruction of Purchaser; or (iii) the patent infringement claim resulted from the use or disposition of material, equipment or other items furnished to Contractor by Purchaser. 

31                  ASSIGNMENT  

(a)        Purchaser Assignment  .  Purchaser may assign this Contract in whole or in part to another individual or company at any time prior to Delivery of any Vessel only with the prior written consent of Contractor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.  It shall not be unreasonable for Contractor to withhold consent for reasons of financial insecurity of any proposed assignee unless Purchaser remains primarily liable for all of Purchaser s obligations under this Contract.  Purchaser will not assign the management of the construction or supervising aspect of this Contract to another entity without having obtained the prior written consent of Contractor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.  Contractor consents to Purchaser granting a Permitted Financing Assignment in this Contract and Purchaser s rights in the Vessel and materials in connection with the  

49 

financing of the Vessel.  A  Permitted Financing Assignment  shall mean any granting of any security interest or lien, or any other assignment (including without limitation any assignment in connection with the exercise of remedies by any Lender Party) by Purchaser of (a) this Contract and Purchaser s rights hereunder, and/or (b) Purchaser s rights to and with respect to the Vessel and the work in process with respect to the Vessel, in each case to or for the benefit of MARAD as defined in Article XIX or any lender providing construction or post-delivery period financing to Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser or any other financing or refinancing to Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser relating to or secured directly or indirectly by this Contract, the Vessel and/or any work in process (any such lender, a  Lender Party ), or any designee of any such Lender Party; provided that no such assignment shall diminish Purchaser s obligations to perform under this Contract.  The term  Lender Party  shall include MARAD.  In connection with any such Permitted Financing Assignment, Contractor agrees to execute a consent and agreement on commercially reasonable terms and conditions. 

(b)        Change in Control.   Should 50% or more of the current ownership composition of Purchaser or Contractor, change either directly, or indirectly, by merger, operation of law, sale of a majority of its stock, assets, and/or shares, (whether publicly traded or not), transferred, exchanged, and/or subjected to a conveyance, in whole or in part, then a  change of control  shall be deemed to have occurred.  A change of control for purposes of this Contract shall constitute an assignment of a party s interest under paragraph (a) or (c) requiring the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Such consent shall be required even if the entity to which the Party is being transferred has been corporately affiliated with it at the time this Contract was executed. 

(c)        Contractor Assignment  .  Contractor may assign this Contract in whole or in part to another individual or company only with the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

(d)        Obligations of Both Parties  .  Should either Party determine that it desires to assign this Contract in whole or in part, it shall provide written notice to the other Party in accordance with the AUTHORIZED PERSONS, NOTICES AND COMMUNICATIONS Article 42.  The other Party shall respond to such notice within 60 days of receipt with its written consent or set forth its objections to the assignment.  As to any assignment by either Party hereto, however, the Party making the assignment shall, after assignment, remain secondarily liable for performance under this Contract. An assignee, if duly accepted, shall assume all of the rights, duties and obligations of the assigning party.   

32                  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

(a)        Governing Law  .  This Contract shall be governed by the Federal laws of the United States of America and the state laws of California, excluding conflict of law rules that dictate the application of laws in other jurisdictions. 

(b)        Compliance with Laws  .  Purchaser and Contractor shall comply with all Laws affecting the Contract Work, shipyards, plants, and vessels in or on navigable waters and the shores thereof, and all other waters subject to the control of the United States.  For the purpose of this paragraph, "Laws" mean any statute, ordinance, rule,  

50 

decree, requirement or regulation of any governmental authority or agency, whether national, state, municipal, local or other government subdivision in any way affecting Contract Work.

33                  DISPUTES 

Except as otherwise provided in this Contract, any and all differences and disputes of whatsoever nature arising out of the Contract which cannot be settled by the parties themselves ( Dispute  or "Disputes") shall be subject to the following: 

(a)        Informal Dispute Resolution.   The Parties agree to utilize informal dispute resolution processes including but not limited to good faith efforts by both management teams to resolve disputes prior to arbitration or litigation. 

(b)        Arbitration  .  Subject to the requirement that the Parties shall have tried the informal dispute resolution process in paragraph (a) and have failed to reach a resolution within a reasonable period, and subject to the paragraphs below, Disputes shall be settled by arbitration.  Any such arbitration shall be conducted by three arbitrators ( Arbitrators ) in accordance with the procedures set forth by the American Arbitration Association, except as otherwise provided by this Article.  Hearings during arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles County, California.  The party desiring such arbitration shall serve upon the other party written notice of its desire, specifying the question or questions to be arbitrated.  The other party may, within 15 days after receipt of said notice, specify any additional questions to be arbitrated. One of the three Arbitrators will be selected by Contractor, one by Purchaser and the third will be mutually agreed to by the Parties.  In the event that the parties cannot agree on one neutral arbitrator within 30 days from the original notice, or within 15 days after the position of Arbitrator shall become vacant, the parties agree that the neutral Arbitrator shall be promptly selected by the President of the Maritime Law Association of the United States, or by the person performing the duties of the President if the President is absent or otherwise unable to perform the duties of the President, upon written request by the party desiring arbitration.  No person designated as Arbitrator under this Contract shall have had or shall then have any expectation of acquiring any business or financial relationship with either of the parties hereto, except such relationship as may be acquired solely by reason of being designated as Arbitrator.  For all matters submitted to arbitration during the term of this Contract, the Arbitrators shall be directed to undertake proceedings on an expedited basis so that a prompt decision of the question or questions can be announced by the Arbitrators to the parties.  Upon the selection of the Arbitrators, each of the parties shall be entitled to commence reasonable discovery through exchange of documents, requests for admissions or depositions, subject to the sole discretion of the Arbitrators, provided, however, that the Arbitrators shall limit depositions, if any, to those deemed essential to the fair and reasonable resolution of the dispute.  The decision of the Arbitrators shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon the parties.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract to the contrary, either Party may appeal the Arbitrators  decision on the grounds  

51 

that it is based upon (i) an error of law that is material and prejudicial, or (ii) determinations of fact that are clearly erroneous.  An appellant or cross-appellant may be assessed costs and attorneys  fees if not determined to be the prevailing party.  The fee and expenses of the Arbitrators shall be borne equally by the parties.  The Arbitrators shall determine and shall include in any award Interest (as defined in the PAYMENTS Article 4) on any amounts determined payable by either party under the Contract from the date of overpayment or underpayment.  The Arbitrators shall not be entitled to award indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages to either party.  The decision of the Arbitrator may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. 

(c)        Litigation  .  Anything in subparagraph (a) and (b) above notwithstanding, any Dispute for claims totaling in excess of $2,000,000, excluding interest, attorney fees, expert fees and other costs, may be litigated in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and the parties hereby consent to such exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any such Disputes.  In addition, regardless of the size or nature of the dispute, the parties may seek injunctive relief at any time.
