(1)                                         Other than the Company s investments listed in footnote 7 below (subject to the limitations set forth therein), the Company does not  Control  any of its portfolio companies, for the purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the  Investment Company Act ). In general, under the Investment Company Act, the Company would  Control  a portfolio company if the Company owned more than 25% of its outstanding voting securities (i.e., securities with the right to elect directors) and/or had the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company. All of the Company s portfolio company investments, which as of September 30, 2016 represented 169% of the Company s net assets or 96% of the Company s total assets, are subject to legal restrictions on sales.  
     
  (2)                                         These assets are pledged as collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and, as a result, are not directly available to the creditors of the Company to satisfy any obligations of the Company other than the Company s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).  
     
  (3)                                         These assets are owned by the Company s consolidated subsidiary Ares Capital CP Funding LLC ( Ares Capital CP ), are pledged as collateral for the Revolving Funding Facility (as defined below) and, as a result, are not directly available to the creditors of the Company to satisfy any obligations of the Company other than Ares Capital CP s obligations under the Revolving Funding Facility (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).  
     
  (4)                                         These assets are owned by the Company s consolidated subsidiary Ares Capital JB Funding LLC ( ACJB ), are pledged as collateral for the SMBC Funding Facility (as defined below) and, as a result, are not directly available to the creditors of the Company to satisfy any obligations of the Company other than ACJB s obligations under the SMBC Funding Facility (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).  
     
  (5)                                         These assets are owned by the Company s consolidated subsidiary Ares Venture Finance, L.P. ( AVF LP ), are pledged as collateral for the SBA-guaranteed debentures (the  SBA Debentures ) and, as a result, are not directly available to

  the creditors of the Company to satisfy any obligations of the Company other than AVF LP s obligations (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). AVF LP operates as a Small Business Investment Company ( SBIC ) under the provisions of Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended.  
     
  (6)                                         Investments without an interest rate are non-income producing.  
     
  (7)                                         As defined in the Investment Company Act, the Company is deemed to be an  Affiliated Person  and  Control  this portfolio company because it owns 5% or more of the portfolio company s outstanding voting securities or it has the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company (including through a management agreement). Transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in which the issuer was an Affiliated Person (but not a portfolio company that the Company is deemed to Control) are as follows:  

(8)                                         As defined in the Investment Company Act, the Company is deemed to be both an  Affiliated Person  and  Control  this portfolio company because it owns more than 25% of the portfolio company s outstanding voting securities or it has the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company (including through a management agreement). Transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in which the issuer was both an Affiliated Person and a portfolio company that the Company is deemed to Control are as follows:

  *                                               Together with Varagon Capital Partners ( Varagon ), the Company has co-invested through the Senior Direct Lending Program LLC (d/b/a the  Senior Direct Lending Program  or the  SDLP ). The SDLP has been capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of the Company and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required); therefore, although the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities of the SDLP, the Company does not believe that it has control over the SDLP (for purposes of the Investment Company Act or otherwise) because, among other things, these  voting securities  do not afford the Company the right to elect directors of the SDLP or any other special rights (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).  
     
  **                                          Together with GE Global Sponsor Finance LLC and General Electric Capital Corporation (together,  GE ), the Company has co-invested through the Senior Secured Loan Fund LLC (d/b/a the  Senior Secured Loan Program  or the  SSLP ). The SSLP has been capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SSLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SSLP consisting of representatives of the Company and GE (with approval from a representative of each required); therefore, although the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities of the SSLP, the Company does not believe that it has control over the SSLP (for purposes of the Investment Company Act or otherwise) because, among other things, these  voting securities  do not afford the Company the right to elect directors of the SSLP or any other special rights (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).  
     
  (9)                                         Non-U.S. company or principal place of business outside the U.S. and as a result is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. Under the Investment Company Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time such acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company s total assets.  
     
  (10)                                    Exception from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c) of the Investment Company Act and as a result is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. Under the Investment Company Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time such acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company s total assets.  
     
  (11)                                    In the first quarter of 2011, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Staff ) informally communicated to certain business development companies ( BDCs ) the Staff s belief that certain entities, which would be classified as an  investment company  under the Investment Company Act but for the exception from the definition of  investment company  set forth in Rule 3a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act, could not be treated as eligible portfolio companies (as defined in Section 2(a)(46) under Investment Company Act) (i.e. not eligible to be included in a BDC s 70%  qualifying assets  basket). Subsequently, in August 2011 the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a concept release (the  Concept Release ) which stated that  [a]s a general matter, the Commission presently does not believe that Rule 3a-7 issuers are the type of small, developing and financially troubled businesses in which the U.S. Congress intended BDCs primarily to invest  and requested comment on whether or not a 3a-7 issuer should be considered an  eligible portfolio company . The Company provided a comment letter in respect of the Concept Release and continues to believe that the language of Section 2(a)(46) of the Investment Company Act permits a BDC to treat as  eligible portfolio companies  entities that rely on the 3a-7 exception. However, given the current uncertainty in this area (including the language in the Concept Release) and subsequent discussions with the Staff, the Company has, solely for purposes of calculating the composition of its portfolio pursuant to Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act, identified such entities, which include the SSLP, as  non-qualifying assets  should the Staff ultimately disagree with the Company s position. Pursuant to Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act (using the Staff s methodology described above solely for this purpose), 28% of the Company s total assets are represented by investments at fair value and other assets that are considered  non-qualifying assets  as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  (12)                                    Variable rate loans to the Company s portfolio companies bear interest at a rate that may be determined by reference to either LIBOR or an alternate base rate (commonly based on the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate), at the borrower s option, which reset annually (A), semi-annually (S), quarterly (Q), bi-monthly (B), monthly (M) or daily (D). For each such loan, the Company has provided the interest rate in effect on the date presented.  
     
  (13)                                    In addition to the interest earned based on the stated interest rate of this security, the Company is entitled to receive an additional interest amount of 1.13% on $10 million aggregate principal amount of a  first out  tranche of the portfolio company s senior term debt previously syndicated by the Company into  first out  and  last out  tranches, whereby the  
     
 27   

Table of Contents   
     
   first out  tranche will have priority as to the  last out  tranche with respect to payments of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder.  
     
  (14)                                    In addition to the interest earned based on the stated interest rate of this security, the Company is entitled to receive an additional interest amount of 2.00% on $82 million aggregate principal amount of a  first out  tranche of the portfolio company s senior term debt previously syndicated by the Company into  first out  and  last out  tranches, whereby the  first out  tranche will have priority as to the  last out  tranche with respect to payments of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder.  
     
  (15)                                    In addition to the interest earned based on the stated interest rate of this security, the Company is entitled to receive an additional interest amount of 2.50% on $70 million aggregate principal amount of a  first out  tranche of the portfolio company s senior term debt previously syndicated by the Company into  first out  and  last out  tranches, whereby the  first out  tranche will have priority as to the  last out  tranche with respect to payments of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder.  
     
  (16)                                    In addition to the interest earned based on the stated interest rate of this security, the Company is entitled to receive an additional interest amount of 5.00% on $17 million aggregate principal amount of a  first out  tranche of the portfolio company s senior term debt previously syndicated by the Company into  first out  and  last out  tranches, whereby the  first out  tranche will have priority as to the  last out  tranche with respect to payments of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder.  
     
  (17)                                    In addition to the interest earned based on the stated interest rate of this security, the Company is entitled to receive an additional interest amount of 2.55% on $41 million aggregate principal amount of a  first out  tranche of the portfolio company s first lien senior secured loans, whereby the  first out  tranche will have priority as to the  last out  tranche with respect to payments of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder.  
     
  (18)                                    The Company is entitled to receive a fixed fee upon the occurrence of certain events as defined in the credit agreement governing the Company s debt investment in the portfolio company. The fair value of such fee is included in the fair value of the debt investment.  
     
  (19)                                    Loan was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  (20)                                    Loan includes interest rate floor feature.  
     
  (21)                                    The certificates have a stated contractual interest rate and also entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the SSLP s loan portfolio, after expenses. However, the SSLP Certificates are junior in right of payment to the Senior Notes held by GE, and the Company expects that for so long as principal proceeds from SSLP repayments are directed entirely to repay the Senior Notes as discussed above, the yield on the SSLP Certificates will be lower than the stated coupon and continue to decline. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the SSLP.  
     
  (22)                                    In addition to the interest earned based on the stated contractual interest rate of this security, the certificates entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the SDLP s loan portfolio, after expenses, which may result in a return to the Company greater than the contractual stated interest rate.  
     
  (23)                                    As of September 30, 2016, no amounts were funded by the Company under this first lien senior secured revolving loan; however, there were letters of credit issued and outstanding through a financial intermediary under the loan. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on letters of credit commitments related to certain portfolio companies.  
     
  (24)                                    As of September 30, 2016, in addition to the amounts funded by the Company under this first lien senior secured revolving loan, there were also letters of credit issued and outstanding through a financial intermediary under the loan. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on letters of credit commitments related to certain portfolio companies.  
     
  (25)                                    As of September 30, 2016, the Company had the following commitments to fund various revolving and delayed draw senior secured and subordinated loans, including commitments to issue letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies.

In general, under the Investment Company Act, the Company would  Control  a portfolio company if the Company owned more than 25% of its outstanding voting securities (i.e., securities with the right to elect directors) and/or had the power to exercise control over the management or policies of such portfolio company. All of the Company s portfolio company investments, which as of December 31, 2015 represented 175% of the Company s net assets or 95% of the Company s total assets, are subject to legal restrictions on sales.

*                                               Together with GE, the Company has co-invested through the SSLP. The SSLP has been capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SSLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SSLP consisting of representatives of the Company and GE (with approval from a representative of each required); therefore, although the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities of the SSLP, the Company does not believe that it has control over the SSLP (for purposes of the Investment Company Act or otherwise) because, among other things, these  voting securities  do not afford the Company the right to elect directors of the SSLP or any other special rights (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).  
     
  (9)                                         Non-U.S. company or principal place of business outside the U.S. and as a result is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. Under the Investment Company Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time such acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company s total assets.  
     
  (10)                                    Exception from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c) of the Investment Company Act and as a result is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. Under the Investment Company Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time such acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company s total assets.  
     
  (11)                                    In the first quarter of 2011, the Staff informally communicated to certain BDCs the Staff s belief that certain entities, which would be classified as an  investment company  under the Investment Company Act but for the exception from the definition of  investment company  set forth in Rule 3a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act, could not be treated as eligible portfolio companies (as defined in Section 2(a)(46) under Investment Company Act) (i.e. not eligible to be included in a BDC s 70%  qualifying assets  basket). Subsequently, in August 2011 the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a concept release (the  Concept Release ) which stated that  [a]s a general matter, the Commission presently does not believe that Rule 3a-7 issuers are the type of small, developing and financially troubled businesses in which the U.S. Congress intended BDCs primarily to invest  and requested comment on whether or not a 3a-7 issuer should be considered an  eligible portfolio company . The Company provided a comment letter in respect of the Concept Release and continues to believe that the language of Section 2(a)(46) of the Investment Company Act permits a BDC to treat as  eligible portfolio companies  entities that rely on the 3a-7 exception. However, given the current uncertainty in this area (including the language in the Concept Release) and subsequent discussions with the Staff, the Company has, solely for purposes of calculating the composition of its portfolio pursuant to Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act, identified such entities, which include the SSLP, as  non-qualifying assets  should the Staff ultimately disagree with the Company s position. Pursuant to Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act (using the Staff s methodology described above solely for this purpose), 25% of the Company s total assets are represented by investments at fair value and other assets that are considered  non-qualifying assets  as of December 31, 2015.

   1.                                           ORGANIZATION  
     
  Ares Capital Corporation (the  Company  or  ARCC ) is a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company incorporated in Maryland. The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the  Investment Company Act ). The Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs.  
     
  The Company s investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. The Company invests primarily in first lien senior secured loans (including  unitranche  loans, which are loans that combine both senior and mezzanine debt, generally in a first lien position), second lien senior secured loans and mezzanine debt, which in some cases includes an equity component. To a lesser extent, the Company also makes equity investments.  
     
  The Company is externally managed by Ares Capital Management LLC ( Ares Capital Management  or the Company s  investment adviser ), a subsidiary of Ares Management, L.P. ( Ares Management  or  Ares ), a publicly traded, leading global alternative asset manager, pursuant to an investment advisory and management agreement. Ares Operations LLC ( Ares Operations  or the Company s  administrator ), a subsidiary of Ares Management, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for the Company to operate.  
     
   2.                                           SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
     
    Basis of Presentation    
     
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), and include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company is an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 946. The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the operations and financial condition as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  
     
  Interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Articles 6 or 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim period presented, have been included. The current period s results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.  
     
    Cash and Cash Equivalents    
     
  Cash and cash equivalents include funds from time to time deposited with financial institutions and short-term, liquid investments in a money market account. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair value.  
     
    Concentration of Credit Risk    
     
  The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions and, at times, cash held in money market accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit.

   ARES CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   As of September 30, 2016   
   (unaudited)   
   (in thousands, except per share data, percentages and as otherwise indicated; for example, with the words  million,  billion  or otherwise)   
     
    Investments    
     
  Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized.  
     
  Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, the Company looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available (i.e., substantially all of the Company s investments) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Company s board of directors, based on, among other things, the input of the Company s investment adviser, audit committee and independent third-party valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the Company s board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing 12-month period (with certain de minimis exceptions) and under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. The valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, and a minimum of 55% of the Company s portfolio at fair value is subject to review by an independent valuation firm each quarter. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm obtains an understanding of, and performs select procedures relating to, the Company s investment valuation process within the context of performing the integrated audit.  
     
  As part of the valuation process, the Company may take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of the Company s investments: the enterprise value of a portfolio company (the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets, which may affect the price at which similar investments would trade in their principal markets and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Company considers the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate its valuation.  
     
  Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in its portfolio, the Company values substantially all of its portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by its board of directors, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it.  
     
  In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.  
     
  The Company s board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:  
     
                        The Company s quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the Company s portfolio management team. 
     
                        Preliminary valuations are reviewed and discussed with the Company s investment adviser s management and investment professionals, and then valuation recommendations are presented to the Company s board of directors. 
     
                        The audit committee of the Company s board of directors reviews these valuations, as well as the input of third parties, including independent third-party valuation firms, who review a minimum of 55% of the Company s portfolio at fair value. 
     
                        The Company s board of directors discusses valuations and ultimately determines the fair value of each investment in the Company s portfolio without a readily available market quotation in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the Company s investment adviser, audit committee and, where applicable, independent third-party valuation firms. 
     
  See Note 8 for more information on the Company s valuation process.

    Interest and Dividend Income Recognition    
     
  Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums. Discounts from and premiums to par value on securities purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, if any.  
     
  Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. The Company may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.  
     
  Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.  
     
    Payment-in-Kind Interest    
     
  The Company has loans in its portfolio that contain payment-in-kind ( PIK ) provisions. The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income. To maintain the Company s status as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash.  
     
    Capital Structuring Service Fees and Other Income    
     
  The Company s investment adviser seeks to provide assistance to its portfolio companies and in return the Company may receive fees for capital structuring services. These fees are generally only available to the Company as a result of the Company s underlying investments, are normally paid at the closing of the investments, are generally non-recurring and are recognized as revenue when earned upon closing of the investment. The services that the Company s investment adviser provides vary by investment, but generally include reviewing existing credit facilities, arranging bank financing, arranging equity financing, structuring financing from multiple lenders, structuring financing from multiple equity investors, restructuring existing loans, raising equity and debt capital, and providing general financial advice, which concludes upon closing of the investment. Any services of the above nature subsequent to the closing would generally generate a separate fee payable to the Company. In certain instances where the Company is invited to participate as a co-lender in a transaction and does not provide significant services in connection with the investment, a portion of loan fees paid to the Company in such situations will be deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the loan.  
     
  Other income includes fees for management and consulting services, loan guarantees, commitments, amendments and other services rendered by the Company to portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered.  
     
    Foreign Currency Translation    
     
  The Company s books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis:  
     
  (1)            Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the period. 
     
  (2)            Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions, income or expenses.

   (in thousands, except per share data, percentages and as otherwise indicated; for example, with the words  million,  billion  or otherwise)   
     
  Results of operations based on changes in foreign exchange rates are separately disclosed in the statement of operations, if any. Foreign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and U.S. government securities. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities.  
     
    Derivative Instruments    
     
  The Company does not utilize hedge accounting and as such values its derivatives at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses recorded in  net unrealized gains (losses) from foreign currency and other transactions  in the Company s consolidated statement of operations.  
     
    Equity Offering Expenses    
     
  The Company s offering costs, excluding underwriters  fees, are charged against the proceeds from equity offerings when received.  
     
    Debt Issuance Costs    
     
  Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of the related debt instrument using the straight line method or the effective yield method, depending on the type of debt instrument.  
     
    Income Taxes    
     
  The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, the Company must (among other requirements) meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. The Company (among other requirements) has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal corporate-level income taxes.  
     
  Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions for the current year, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned.  
     
  Certain of the Company s consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes.  
     
    Dividends to Common Stockholders    
     
  Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the Company s board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed, although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains for investment.  
     
  The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any distributions the Company declares in cash on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Company s board of directors authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash dividend, then the Company s stockholders who have not  opted out  of the Company s dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividend. The Company intends to use primarily newly issued shares to implement the dividend reinvestment plan (so long as the Company is trading at a premium to net asset value). If the Company s shares are trading at a discount to net asset value and the Company is otherwise permitted under applicable law to purchase such shares, the Company may purchase shares in the open market in connection with the Company s obligations under the dividend reinvestment plan. However, the Company reserves the right to issue new shares of the Company s common stock in connection with the Company s obligations under the dividend reinvestment plan even if the Company s shares are trading below net asset value.

    Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements    
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of actual and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income or loss and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the valuation of investments.  
     
    Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
     
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,  Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . The new guidance modifies the requirements for reporting debt issuance costs. Under the amendments in ASU No. 2015-03, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability will no longer be recorded as a separate asset, but will be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by ASU No. 2015-03. In addition, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,  Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) . The additional guidance reiterates that the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line of credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings. ASU No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-15 are required to be applied retrospectively for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 as of March 31, 2016. Prior to ASU No. 2015-03, deferred debt issuance costs related to term debt were reported on the balance sheet as other assets and amortized as interest expense. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been adjusted to apply the change in accounting principle retrospectively. There is no effect on the statement of operations as a result of the change in accounting principle. Debt issuance costs related to term debt of $24.5 million previously reported within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 were reclassified as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. ASU No. 2015-03 had no impact on the presentation or amortization of the debt issuance costs related to the Company s revolving credit facilities.  
     
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07,  Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) . The new guidance removed the requirement that investments for which net asset value is determined based on practical expedient reliance be reported utilizing the fair value hierarchy. ASU No. 2015-07 is required to be applied retrospectively for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-07 as of March 31, 2016 and thereby removed any investments valued in this manner from the fair value disclosures. See Note 8 for more information regarding the impact on the fair value disclosures.  
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The guidance in this ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) . Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in ASU No. 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations , which clarifies the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 and has the same effective date as the original standard. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing , an update on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. Additionally, in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , which includes amendments for enhanced clarification of the guidance. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The guidance in this ASU supersedes the leasing guidance in  Leases (Topic 840) . Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases previously classified as operating leases. The amendments in ASU No. 2016-02 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   As of September 30, 2016   
   (unaudited)   
   (in thousands, except per share data, percentages and as otherwise indicated; for example, with the words  million,  billion  or otherwise)   
     
   3.                                           AGREEMENTS  
     
    Investment Advisory and Management Agreement    
     
  The Company is party to an investment advisory and management agreement (the  investment advisory and management agreement ) with Ares Capital Management. Subject to the overall supervision of the Company s board of directors, Ares Capital Management provides investment advisory and management services to the Company. For providing these services, Ares Capital Management receives fees from the Company consisting of a base management fee, a fee based on the Company s net investment income ( income based fee ) and a fee based on the Company s net capital gains ( capital gains incentive fee ). The investment advisory and management agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days  written notice to the other party.  
     
  The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% based on the average value of the Company s total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears.  
     
  The income based fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s net investment income excluding income based fees and capital gains incentive fees ( pre-incentive fee net investment income ) for the quarter.  Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the administration agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the income based fee and capital gains incentive fee accrued under GAAP). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. The Company s investment adviser is not under any obligation to reimburse the Company for any part of the income based fees it received that was based on accrued interest that the Company never actually received.  
     
  Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses, unrealized capital appreciation, unrealized capital depreciation or income tax expense related to realized gains and losses. Because of the structure of the income based fee, it is possible that the Company may pay such fees in a quarter where the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a quarter, the Company will pay the applicable income based fee even if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and/or unrealized capital losses.  
     
  Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed  hurdle rate  of 1.75% per quarter. If market credit spreads rise, the Company may be able to invest its funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which may increase the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for the Company s investment adviser to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an income based fee based on such net investment income. To the extent the Company has retained pre-incentive fee net investment income that has been used to calculate the income based fee, it is also included in the amount of the Company s total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) used to calculate the 1.5% base management fee.  
     
  The Company pays its investment adviser an income based fee with respect to the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:  
     
                        no income based fee in any calendar quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; 
     
                        100% of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. The Company refers to this portion of its pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875%) as the  catch-up  provision. The  catch-up  is meant to provide the Company s investment adviser with 20% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeded 2.1875% in any calendar quarter; and 
     
                        20% of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. 
     
  These calculations are adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter.

  See Note 14 for information regarding a transaction support agreement entered into between the Company and Ares Capital Management in connection with the American Capital Acquisition (as defined below).  
     
  The capital gains incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or, upon termination of the investment advisory and management agreement, as of the termination date) and is calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (a) the sum of the Company s cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from (b) the Company s cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each case calculated from October 8, 2004 (the date the Company completed its initial public offering). Realized capital gains and losses include gains and losses on investments and foreign currencies, gains and losses on extinguishment of debt and from other assets, as well as any income tax expense related to realized gains and losses. If such amount is positive at the end of such year, then the capital gains incentive fee for such year is equal to 20% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no capital gains incentive fee for such year.  
     
  The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Company s portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.  
     
  The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Company s portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.  
     
  The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in the Company s portfolio as of the applicable capital gains incentive fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.  
     
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, as a result of an amendment to the capital gains incentive fee under the investment advisory and management agreement that was adopted on June 6, 2011, if the Company is required by GAAP to record an investment at its fair value as of the time of acquisition instead of at the actual amount paid for such investment by the Company (including, for example, as a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting), then solely for the purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee , the  accreted or amortized cost basis  of an investment shall be an amount (the  Contractual Cost Basis ) equal to (1) (x) the actual amount paid by the Company for such investment plus (y) any amounts recorded in the Company s financial statements as required by GAAP that are attributable to the accretion of such investment plus (z) any other adjustments made to the cost basis included in the Company s financial statements, including PIK interest or additional amounts funded (net of repayments) minus (2) any amounts recorded in the Company s financial statements as required by GAAP that are attributable to the amortization of such investment, whether such calculated Contractual Cost Basis is higher or lower than the fair value of such investment (as determined in accordance with GAAP) at the time of acquisition.  
     
  The Company defers cash payment of any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees otherwise earned by the Company s investment adviser if during the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made the sum of (a) the aggregate distributions to the Company s stockholders and (b) the change in net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fees and capital gains incentive fees payable during the period) is less than 7.0% of the Company s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness) at the beginning of such period. Any deferred income based fees and capital gains incentive fees are carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such payment is payable under the investment advisory and management agreement.  
     
  There was no capital gains incentive fee earned by the Company s investment adviser as calculated under the investment advisory and management agreement (as described above) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. However, in accordance with GAAP, the Company had cumulatively accrued a capital gains incentive fee of $50,963 as of September 30, 2016, of which $50,963 is not currently due under the investment advisory and management agreement. GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the investment advisory and management agreement. This GAAP accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation included in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee plus the aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP requires the Company to record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 20% of such cumulative amount, less the

  aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fees paid or capital gains incentive fees accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has paid capital gains incentive fees since inception totaling $57,404. The resulting accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reversal of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future.  
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, base management fees were $33,923 and $103,126, respectively, and income based fees were $33,052 and $91,097, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the reduction in capital gains incentive fees calculated in accordance with GAAP was $5,491. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the capital gains incentive fees calculated in accordance with GAAP was $8,698. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, base management fees were $33,284 and $100,221, respectively, income based fees were $31,842 and $90,156, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the reduction in capital gains incentive fees calculated in accordance with GAAP was $2,628. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the capital gains incentive fees calculated in accordance with GAAP was $834.  
     
    Administration Agreement    
     
  The Company is party to an administration agreement, referred to herein as the  administration agreement , with its administrator, Ares Operations. Pursuant to the administration agreement, Ares Operations furnishes the Company with office equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at the Company s office facilities. Under the administration agreement, Ares Operations also performs, or oversees the performance of, the Company s required administrative services, which include, among other things, providing assistance in accounting, legal, compliance, operations, technology and investor relations, being responsible for the financial records that the Company is required to maintain and preparing reports to its stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, Ares Operations assists the Company in determining and publishing its net asset value, assists the Company in providing managerial assistance to its portfolio companies, oversees the preparation and filing of the Company s tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to its stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of its expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Company by others. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an amount based upon its allocable portion of Ares Operations  overhead and other expenses (including travel expenses) incurred by Ares Operations in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including the Company s allocable portion of the compensation of certain of its officers (including the Company s chief compliance officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, general counsel, treasurer and assistant treasurer) and their respective staffs. The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days  written notice to the other party.  
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $3,433 and $10,198, respectively, in administrative fees. As of September 30, 2016, $3,433 of these fees were unpaid and included in  accounts payable and other liabilities  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred $3,545 and $10,515, respectively, in administrative fees.

  As of September 30, 2016, 2.3% of total investments at amortized cost (or 1.2% of total investments at fair value) were on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2015, 2.6% of total investments at amortized cost (or 1.7% of total investments at fair value) were on non-accrual status.  
     
   Co-Investment Programs   
     
    Senior Direct Lending Program    
     
  The Company established a joint venture with Varagon to make certain first lien senior secured loans, including certain stretch senior and unitranche loans, to U.S. middle-market companies. Varagon was formed in 2013 as a lending platform by American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) and other partners. The joint venture is called the SDLP. In July 2016, the Company and Varagon and its clients completed the initial funding of the SDLP. In conjunction with the initial funding, the Company and Varagon and its clients sold investment commitments to the SDLP. Such investment commitments included $528.9 million of investment commitments sold to the SDLP by the Company. No realized gains or losses were recorded by the Company on these transactions. The SDLP may generally commit and hold individual loans of up to $300.0 million. The Company may directly co-invest with the SDLP to accommodate larger transactions. The SDLP is capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of the Company and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required).  
     
  The Company provides capital to the SDLP in the form of subordinated certificates (the  SDLP Certificates ), and Varagon and its clients provide capital to the SDLP in the form of senior notes, intermediate funding notes and SDLP Certificates. As of September 30, 2016, the Company and a client of Varagon owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the outstanding SDLP Certificates.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company and Varagon and its clients agreed to make capital available to the SDLP of $2.9 billion in the aggregate, of which $590.6 million has been made available from the Company. This capital will only be committed to the SDLP upon approval of transactions by the investment committee of the SDLP as discussed above.  Below is a summary of the funded capital and unfunded capital commitments of the SDLP.  

(1)                                    At principal amount. 
     
  (2)                                    These commitments have been approved by the investment committee of the SDLP and will be funded as the transactions are completed. 
     
  The SDLP Certificates pay a coupon of LIBOR plus 8.0% and also entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the loan portfolio, after expenses, which may result in a return to the holders of the SDLP Certificates that is greater than the stated coupon. The SDLP Certificates are junior in right of payment to the senior notes and intermediate funding notes.  
     
  The amortized cost and fair value of the SDLP Certificates held by the Company were $195.3 million and $195.3 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016. The Company s yield on its investment in the SDLP at amortized cost and fair value was 13.5% and 13.5%, respectively, as of September 30, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company earned interest income of $4.8 million for each period from its investment in the SDLP Certificates. The Company is also entitled to certain fees in connection with the SDLP. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with the SDLP, the Company earned capital structuring service and other fees totaling $0.8 million for each period.

  As of September 30, 2016, the SDLP s portfolio was comprised entirely of first lien senior secured loans to U.S. middle-market companies and were in industries similar to the companies in the Company s portfolio. As of September 30, 2016, none of the loans were on non-accrual status. Below is a summary of the SDLP s portfolio.

    Senior Secured Loan Program    
     
  The Company and GE have co-invested in first lien senior secured loans of middle market companies through the SSLP. The SSLP has been capitalized as transactions are completed. All portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SSLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SSLP consisting of representatives of the Company and GE (with approval from a representative of each required). The Company has provided capital to the SSLP in the form of subordinated certificates (the  SSLP Certificates ). As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company and GE owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the outstanding SSLP Certificates.  
     
  In August 2015, GE completed the sale of its U.S. Sponsor Finance business, through which GE had participated with the Company in the SSLP, to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ( CPPIB ). This sale excluded GE s interest in the SSLP, and the Company and GE continue to operate the SSLP. The Company and GE no longer have an obligation to present senior secured lending investment opportunities to the SSLP and since June 30, 2015, the SSLP has not made any investments related to new portfolio companies; however, the Company and GE may provide capital to support the SSLP s funding of existing commitments (see below) and other amounts to its portfolio companies. On August 24, 2015, the  Company was advised that GECC, as the holder of the senior notes of the SSLP (the  Senior Notes ), directed State Street Bank and Trust Company, as trustee of the Senior Notes and the SSLP Certificates, pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes and the SSLP Certificates, to apply all principal proceeds received by the SSLP from its investments to the repayment of the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes until paid in full (prior to the distribution of any such principal proceeds to the holders of the SSLP Certificates, which includes the Company). GECC had previously elected to waive its right to receive priority repayments on the Senior Notes from principal proceeds in most circumstances. Prior to closing the sale to CPPIB, GE had announced its intention to provide the Company and CPPIB the opportunity to work together on the SSLP on a go-forward basis. GECC has also stated that if a mutual agreement between the Company and CPPIB to partner on the SSLP is not reached, it intends to retain its interest in the SSLP and the SSLP would be wound down in an orderly manner. The Company has been in dialogue with GE and CPPIB to determine if there is an opportunity to work together; however, to date there has been no agreement in respect of the SSLP as a result of these discussions and there can be no assurance that such discussions will continue or any such agreement will be reached.

   (unaudited)   
   (in thousands, except per share data, percentages and as otherwise indicated; for example, with the words  million,  billion  or otherwise)   
     
  As discussed above, the Company anticipates that no new investments will be made by the SSLP and that possibly the Company and GE will only provide additional capital to support the SSLP s funding of existing commitments and other amounts to its portfolio companies. Below is a summary of the funded capital and unfunded capital commitments of the SSLP.  

(1)                                    At principal amount. 
     
  (2)                                    These commitments have been approved by the investment committee of the SSLP and will be funded as the transactions are completed. 
     
  The SSLP Certificates have a weighted average contractual coupon of LIBOR plus approximately 8.0% and also entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the loan portfolio, after expenses. However, the SSLP Certificates are junior in right of payment to the Senior Notes held by GE, and the Company expects that for so long as principal proceeds from SSLP repayments are directed entirely to repay the Senior Notes as discussed above, the yield on the SSLP Certificates will be lower than the stated coupon and continue to decline.  
     
  The amortized cost and fair value of the SSLP Certificates held by the Company were each $1.9 billion as of September 30, 2016, and each $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2015. The Company s yield on its investment in the SSLP at amortized cost and fair value was 8.5% and 8.7%, respectively, as of September 30, 2016, and 12.0% and 12.3%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company earned interest income of $49.5 million and $165.9 million, respectively, from its investment in the SSLP Certificates. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company earned interest income of $71.4 million and $209.6 million, respectively, from its investment in the SSLP Certificates. The Company is also entitled to certain fees in connection with the SSLP. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with the SSLP, the Company earned capital structuring service, sourcing and other fees totaling $4.6 million and $16.0 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, in connection with the SSLP, the Company earned capital structuring service, sourcing and other fees totaling $8.6 million and $41.8 million, respectively.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the SSLP s portfolio was comprised of all first lien senior secured loans to U.S. middle-market companies and were in industries similar to the companies in the Company s portfolio. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, none of these loans were on non-accrual status. Below is a summary of the SSLP s portfolio.

   5.     DEBT   
     
  In accordance with the Investment Company Act, with certain limited exceptions, the Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the Investment Company Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing.  On June 21, 2016, the Company, Ares Capital Management, Ares Venture Finance GP LLC and AVF LP received exemptive relief from the SEC allowing the Company to modify the Company s calculation of asset coverage requirements to exclude the SBA Debentures (defined below).  As such, the Company s ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness may be less than 200%.  This exemptive relief provides the Company with increased investment flexibility but also increases the Company s risk related to leverage. As of September 30, 2016 the Company s asset coverage was 236% (excluding the SBA Debentures).

    Revolving Credit Facility    
     
  The Company is party to a senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended and restated, the  Revolving Credit Facility ), which allows the Company to borrow up to $1,265,000 at any one time outstanding. For $1,195,000 of the Revolving Credit Facility, the end of the revolving period and the stated maturity date are May 4, 2020 and May 4, 2021, respectively. For the remaining $70,000 of the Revolving Credit Facility, the end of the revolving period and the stated maturity date are May 4, 2019 and May 4, 2020, respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for a feature that allows the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase in the size of the Revolving Credit Facility to a maximum of $1,897,500. The Revolving Credit Facility generally requires payments of interest at the end of each LIBOR interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly, on LIBOR based loans, and monthly payments of interest on other loans. From the end of the revolving period to the stated maturity date, the Company is required to repay outstanding principal amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility on a monthly basis in an amount equal to 1/12th of the outstanding principal amount at the end of the revolving period.  
     
  Under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar revolving credit facilities, including, without limitation, covenants related to: (a) limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, (b) limitations on certain investments, (c) limitations on certain restricted payments, (d) maintaining a certain minimum stockholders  equity, (e) maintaining a ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions) of not less than 2.0:1.0, (f) limitations on pledging certain unencumbered assets, and (g) limitations on the creation or existence of agreements that prohibit liens on certain properties of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the documents governing the Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) are also subject to compliance with a borrowing base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in the Company s portfolio that are pledged as collateral. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were $465,000 and $515,000 outstanding, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, the Revolving Credit Facility also provides for a sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit for up to an aggregate amount of $150,000. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $25,380 and $24,111, respectively, in letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility. The amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by any letters of credit issued. As of September 30, 2016, there was $774,620 available for borrowing (net of letters of credit issued) under the Revolving Credit Facility.

SBA Debentures    
     
  In April 2015, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, AVF LP, received a license from the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) to operate as a Small Business Investment Company ( SBIC ) under the provisions of Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. The SBA places certain limitations on the financing of investments by SBICs in portfolio companies, including regulating the types of financings, restricting investments to only include small businesses with certain characteristics or in certain industries, and requiring capitalization thresholds that may limit distributions to the Company.  
     
  The license from the SBA allows AVF LP to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures (the  SBA Debentures ), subject to issuance of a capital commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. Leverage through the SBA Debentures is subject to required capitalization thresholds. Current SBA regulations limit the amount that any SBIC may borrow to $150,000 and as of September 30, 2016, the amount of the SBA Debentures committed to AVF LP by the SBA was $75,000. The SBA Debentures are non-recourse to the Company, have interest payable semi-annually, have a 10-year maturity and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. As of September 30, 2016, AVF LP had $25,000 of the SBA Debentures issued and outstanding, which mature between September 2025 and March 2026. As of September 30, 2016, AVF LP was in compliance in all material respects with SBA regulatory requirements.  
     
  The interest rate for the SBA Debentures is fixed at the time the SBA Debentures and other applicable SBA-guaranteed debentures can be pooled and sold to the public and is based on a spread over U.S. treasury notes with 10-year maturities. The pooling of newly issued SBA-guaranteed debentures occurs twice per year. The spread includes an annual charge as determined by the SBA (the  Annual Charge ) as well as a market-driven component. Prior to the 10-year fixed interest rate being determined, the interim interest rate charged for the SBA-guarantee debentures is based on LIBOR plus an applicable spread of 0.30% and the Annual Charge. As of September 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate in effect for the SBA Debentures was 3.48%.  
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the components of interest expense, cash paid for interest expense, average stated interest rate and average outstanding balances for the SBA Debentures were as follows:

The Convertible Notes mature upon their respective maturity dates unless previously converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The Company does not have the right to redeem the Convertible Unsecured Notes prior to maturity. The 2017 Convertible Notes, the 2018 Convertible Notes and the 2019 Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.875%, 4.750% and 4.375%, respectively, per year, payable semi-annually.  
     
  In certain circumstances, the Convertible Unsecured Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company s election, at their respective conversion rates (listed below as of September 30, 2016) subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments and the requirements of their respective indenture (the  Convertible Unsecured Notes Indentures ). To the extent the 2017 Convertible Notes are converted, the Company has elected to settle with a combination of cash and shares of its common stock. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding their respective conversion date (listed below), holders may convert their Convertible Unsecured Notes only under certain circumstances set forth in the Convertible Unsecured Notes Indentures. On or after their respective conversion dates until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding their respective maturity date, holders may convert their Convertible Unsecured Notes at any time. In addition, if the Company engages in certain corporate events as described in their respective Convertible Unsecured Notes Indenture, holders of the Convertible Unsecured Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of the Convertible Unsecured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Unsecured Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but excluding, the required repurchase date.  
     
  Certain key terms related to the convertible features for each of the Convertible Unsecured Notes as of September 30, 2016 are listed below.

  As of September 30, 2016, the principal amounts of each series of the Convertible Unsecured Notes exceeded the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of the Company s common stock.  
     
  The Convertible Unsecured Notes Indentures contain certain covenants, including covenants requiring the Company to comply with Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act and to provide financial information to the holders of the Convertible Unsecured Notes under certain circumstances. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the Convertible Unsecured Notes Indentures. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Convertible Unsecured Notes Indentures.  
     
  The Convertible Unsecured Notes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 470-20. Upon conversion of any of the other Convertible Unsecured Notes, the Company intends to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, the Company has the option to pay in cash or shares of the Company s common stock (or a combination of cash and shares) in respect of the excess amount, subject to the requirements of the Convertible Unsecured Notes Indentures. The Company has determined that the embedded conversion options in the Convertible Unsecured Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under GAAP. In accounting for the Convertible Unsecured Notes, the Company estimated at the time of issuance separate debt and equity components for each of the Convertible Unsecured Notes. An original issue discount equal to the equity components of the Convertible Unsecured Notes was recorded in  capital in excess of par value  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the issuance costs associated with the Convertible Unsecured Notes were allocated to the debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.

Generally, the most significant and uncertain term requires the borrower to satisfy a specific use of proceeds covenant. The use of proceeds covenant typically requires the borrower to use the additional loans for the specific purpose of a permitted acquisition or permitted investment, for example. In addition to the use of proceeds covenant, the borrower is generally required to satisfy additional negotiated covenants (including specified leverage levels).  
     
  Also included within the total revolving and delayed draw loan commitments as of September 30, 2016 were commitments to issue up to $53,469 in letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $12,019 in letters of credit issued and outstanding under these commitments on behalf of portfolio companies. For all these letters of credit issued and outstanding, the Company would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. None of these letters of credit issued and outstanding are recorded as a liability on the Company s balance sheet as such letters of credit are considered in the valuation of the investments in the portfolio company. Of these letters of credit, $22 expire in 2016, $11,983 expire in 2017 and $14 expire in 2018.

  The Company also has commitments to co-invest in the SSLP and the SDLP for the Company s portion of the SSLP s and the SDLP s commitments to fund delayed draw loans to certain portfolio companies of the SSLP and the SDLP. See Note 4 for more information.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was party to subscription agreements to fund equity investments in private equity investment partnerships as follows:  

In the ordinary course of business, the Company may sell certain of its investments to third party purchasers. In particular, in connection with the sale of certain controlled portfolio company equity investments (as well as certain other sales) the Company has, and may continue to do so in the future, agreed to indemnify such purchasers for future liabilities arising from the investments and the related sale transaction. Such indemnification provisions have given rise to liabilities in the past and may do so in the future.  
     
   8.     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   
     
  The Company follows ASC 825-10, which provides companies the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC 825-10 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. The Company has not elected the ASC 825-10 option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. With the exception of the line items entitled  other assets  and  debt,  which are reported at amortized cost, all assets and liabilities approximate fair value on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the lines titled  interest receivable,   receivable for open trades,   payable for open trades,   accounts payable and other liabilities,   base management fees payable,   income based fees payable,   capital gains incentive fees payable  and  interest and facility fees payable  approximate fair value due to their short maturity.  
     
  The Company also follows ASC 820-10, which expands the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Company to assume that the portfolio investment is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820-10, the Company has considered its principal market as the market in which the Company exits its portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. In accordance with ASC 820-10, these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:  
     
                         Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. 
     
                         Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
     
                         Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

   (in thousands, except per share data, percentages and as otherwise indicated; for example, with the words  million,  billion  or otherwise)   
     
  In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Company continues to employ the net asset valuation policy approved by the Company s board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820-10 (see Note 2). Consistent with the Company s valuation policy, it evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which the Company s investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. The Company s valuation policy considers the fact that because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in the Company s portfolio, the fair value of the investments must typically be determined using unobservable inputs.  
     
  The Company s portfolio investments (other than as described below in the following paragraph) are typically valued using two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value ( EV ) of the portfolio company. Enterprise value means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company s EBITDA (generally defined as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization). EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. The Company may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues or, in the case of certain portfolio companies in the power generation industry, kilowatt capacity. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments, the value of debt investments in portfolio companies where the Company has control or could gain control through an option or warrant security, and to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other methods such as a liquidation or wind-down analysis may be utilized to estimate enterprise value. The second valuation technique is a yield analysis, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments in portfolio companies where the Company does not own a controlling equity position. To determine fair value using a yield analysis, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the yield analysis, the Company considers the current contractual interest rate, the maturity and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the enterprise value of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by the Company are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, the Company depends on primary market data, including newly funded transactions, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.  
     
  For other portfolio investments such as investments in the SSLP Certificates, discounted cash flow analysis is the primary technique utilized to determine fair value. Expected future cash flows associated with the investment are discounted to determine a present value using a discount rate that reflects estimated market return requirements.

   (in thousands, except per share data, percentages and as otherwise indicated; for example, with the words  million,  billion  or otherwise)   
     
  The following tables summarize the significant unobservable inputs the Company used to value the majority of its investments categorized within Level 3 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The tables are not intended to be all-inclusive, but instead capture the significant unobservable inputs relevant to the Company s determination of fair values.  

Changes in market yields, discount rates or EBITDA multiples, each in isolation, may change the fair value of certain of the Company s investments. Generally, an increase in market yields or discount rates or decrease in EBITDA multiples may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain of the Company s investments.  
     
  Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it.

9.     STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY   
     
  There were no sales of the Company s equity securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. See Note 11 for information regarding shares of common stock issued or purchased in accordance with the Company s dividend reinvestment plan.  
     
   Stock Repurchase Program   
     
  In September 2015, the Company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $100 million in the aggregate of its outstanding common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below its net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by the Company, in its discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. The program will be in effect until February 28, 2017, unless extended or until the approved dollar amount has been used to repurchase shares. The program does not require the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and it cannot assure stockholders that any shares will be repurchased under the program. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had repurchased a total of 515 shares of its common stock in the open market under the stock repurchase program since its inception in September 2015, at an average price of $13.92 per share, including commissions paid, leaving approximately $92.8 million available for additional repurchases under the program.  
     
  In May 2016, the Company suspended its stock repurchase program pending the completion of the American Capital Acquisition (see Note 14 for more information). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased a total of 393 shares of the Company s common stock in the open market for $5,477 under the stock repurchase program. The shares were repurchased at an average price of $13.94 per share, including commissions paid.  
     
   10.     EARNINGS PER SHARE   
     
  The following information sets forth the computations of basic and diluted net increase in stockholders  equity resulting from operations per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

For the purpose of calculating diluted net increase in stockholders  equity resulting from operations per share, the average closing price of the Company s common stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was less than the conversion price for each of the Convertible Unsecured Notes outstanding as of September 30, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the average closing price of the Company s common stock was less than the conversion

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the total return based on net asset value equaled the change in net asset value during the period plus the declared and payable dividends of $1.19 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, divided by the beginning net asset value for the period. These calculations are adjusted for shares issued in connection with the dividend reinvestment plan, the issuance of common stock in connection with any equity offerings and the equity components of any convertible notes issued during the period. The Company s performance changes over time and currently may be different than that shown. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the ratio of operating expenses to average net assets consisted of 2.53% of base management fees, 2.29% of income based fees and capital gains incentive fees, 4.33% of the cost of borrowing and 0.83% of other operating expenses. 
     
  (8)                                    The ratio of net investment income to average net assets excludes income taxes related to realized gains and losses. 
     
   14.    AMERICAN CAPITAL ACQUISITION   
     
  On May 23, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the  Merger Agreement ) to acquire American Capital, Ltd. ( American Capital ), a Delaware corporation, in a cash and stock transaction (the  American Capital Acquisition ).  As of May 20, 2016, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the American Capital Acquisition, the transaction had an implied value of approximately $4.0 billion, or $17.40 per fully diluted share of American Capital common stock. As of September 30, 2016, the transaction had an implied value of approximately $4.0 billion, or $17.55 per fully diluted share of American Capital common stock.  
     
  Upon the completion of the American Capital Acquisition, each share of American Capital common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the American Capital Acquisition will be converted into the right to receive from the Company, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, (i) $6.41 per share in cash consideration, (ii) stock consideration at the fixed exchange ratio of 0.483 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company s common stock (subject to the payment of cash instead of fractional shares) (the  Exchange Ratio ) (iii) $1.20 per share in cash from Ares Capital Management, acting solely on its own behalf (see Transaction Support Agreement discussed below) and (iv) $2.45 per share in cash, which amount represents the per share cash consideration paid to American Capital pursuant to the sale by American Capital of American Capital Mortgage Management, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of American Capital Asset Management, LLC ( ACAM ), a wholly owned portfolio company of American Capital, to American Capital Agency Corp.  
     
  Additionally, depending on the effective time of the American Capital Acquisition, each share of American Capital common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the American Capital Acquisition will be converted into the right to receive, if any, the make-up dividend amount. The make-up dividend amount would equal (A) if the closing occurs after the record date with respect to the Company s dividend payable with respect to the Company s fourth quarter of 2016, 37.5% of the Exchange Ratio times the Company s dividend for such quarter, plus (B) if the closing occurs after the record date with respect to the Company s dividend payable with respect to the first quarter of 2017, 75% of the Exchange Ratio times the Company s dividend for such quarter, plus (C) if the closing occurs after the record date with respect to the Company s dividend for any subsequent quarter, 100% of the Exchange Ratio times the Company s dividend for such quarter.  The Exchange Ratio was fixed on the date of the Merger Agreement, and is not subject to adjustment based on changes in the trading price of the Company s or American Capital s common stock before the closing of the American Capital Acquisition. Based on the number of shares of American Capital common stock outstanding on the date of the Merger Agreement, the above would result in approximately 110.8 million of the Company s shares being exchanged for approximately 229.3 million fully diluted shares of American Capital common stock, subject to adjustment in certain limited circumstances.  
     
  In connection with the American Capital Acquisition, ACAM will merge with and into IHAM, with IHAM remaining as the surviving entity as a wholly owned portfolio company of the Company.

   ARES CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   As of September 30, 2016   
   (unaudited)   
   (in thousands, except per share data, percentages and as otherwise indicated; for example, with the words  million,  billion  or otherwise)   
     
  The completion of the American Capital Acquisition is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, American Capital stockholder approval, the Company s stockholder approval, required regulatory approvals (including from certain regulatory authorities), receipt of certain third party consents, including third party consents from certain investment funds managed by ACAM and its subsidiaries representing at least 75% of the aggregate assets under management of all such funds as of March 31, 2016 and other customary closing conditions. While there can be no assurances as to the exact timing, or that the American Capital Acquisition will be completed at all, the Company expects to complete the American Capital Acquisition as early as the first week of January 2017.  
     
  Additionally, on May 23, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Ares Capital Management, its investment adviser (the  Transaction Support Agreement ) in connection with the American Capital Acquisition. Under the terms of the Transaction Support Agreement, the Company s investment adviser will (i) provide approximately $275 million of cash consideration, or $1.20 per share of American Capital common stock, payable to American Capital stockholders in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement at closing and (ii) waive, for each of the first ten calendar quarters beginning with the first full calendar quarter after the closing of the American Capital Acquisition, the lesser of (x) $10 million of income based fees and (y) the amount of income based fees for such quarter, in each case, to the extent earned and payable by the Company in such quarter pursuant to and as calculated under the Company s investment advisory and management agreement. The financial support contemplated by the Transaction Support Agreement is conditioned upon completion of the American Capital Acquisition, which is subject to the closing conditions described above.  
     
  The American Capital Acquisition is expected to be accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50,  Business Combinations-Related Issues.  The fair value of the merger consideration paid by the Company is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the date of acquisition and will not give rise to goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the merger consideration paid by the Company, then the Company would recognize a deemed contribution from Ares Capital Management in an amount up to the cash consideration to be paid by Ares Capital Management described above. If the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the aggregate merger consideration paid by the Company and by Ares Capital Management, then the Company would recognize a purchase accounting gain. Alternatively, if the fair value of the net assets acquired is less than the fair value of the merger consideration paid by the Company, then Ares Capital would recognize a purchase accounting loss.  
     
  Also in connection with the American Capital Acquisition, Ares Capital CP received commitments from certain lenders to provide $460.0 million in new commitments under the Revolving Funding Facility, which would bring the total commitments of the Revolving Funding Facility to $1.0 billion. The new commitments are conditioned upon completion of the American Capital Acquisition, which is subject to certain closing conditions described above, and also are subject to final documentation of the amendment to the Revolving Funding Facility.  
     
  In May 2016, in connection with the American Capital Acquisition, the Company suspended its stock repurchase program pending the completion of the American Capital Acquisition.  
     
   15.    LITIGATION   
     
  American Capital and the Company are aware that a consolidated putative shareholder class action has been filed by stockholders of American Capital challenging the American Capital Acquisition. On or about August 18, 2016, shareholders of American Capital filed a consolidated putative shareholder class action allegedly on behalf of holders of the common stock of American Capital against the members of American Capital s board of directors in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland due to the directors  actions in approving the American Capital Acquisition. This action is a consolidation of putative shareholder complaints filed against the directors of American Capital on June 24, 2016, July 12, 2016, July 21, 2016 and July 27, 2016. The action alleges that the directors failed to adequately discharge their fiduciary duties to the public shareholders of American Capital by hastily commencing a sales process due to the board s manipulation by a major shareholder, Elliott Management Corp. (together with its affiliates,  Elliott Management ). The complaint also alleges that the directors then failed to obtain for the shareholders the highest value available in the marketplace for their shares. The complaint further alleges that the proposed merger was the product of a flawed sales process due to Elliott Management s continued manipulation of the directors, the use of deal protection devices in the American Capital Acquisition that precluded other bidders from making a higher offer to American Capital, and the directors  conflicts of interest due to special benefits, including the full vesting of American Capital stock options and incentive awards, or golden parachutes the directors are due to receive upon consummation of the proposed merger. Additionally, the complaint alleges that the Company s Registration Statement on Form N-14, which was filed with the SEC on July 20, 2016 and includes a joint proxy statement to American Capital s

  shareholders, is materially false and misleading because it omits material information concerning the financial and procedural fairness of the proposed merger. The complaint seeks to enjoin the American Capital Acquisition. In the event that the American Capital Acquisition is completed, the complaint seeks to recover compensatory damages for all losses resulting from the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The court has ordered that this case proceed to expedited discovery. The Company believes that these claims are without merit.  
     
  On May 20, 2013, the Company was named as one of several defendants in an action (the Action) filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the Pennsylvania Court) by the bankruptcy trustee of DSI Renal Holdings LLC and two related companies. On March 17, 2014, the Action was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the Delaware Court) pursuant to a motion filed by the defendants and granted by the Pennsylvania Court. On May 6, 2014, the Delaware Court referred the Action to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint in the Action alleges, among other things, that each of the named defendants participated in a purported fraudulent transfer involving the restructuring of a subsidiary of DSI Renal Holdings LLC. Among other things, the complaint seeks, jointly and severally from all defendants, (1) damages of approximately $425 million, of which the complaint states the Company s individual share is approximately $117 million, and (2) punitive damages. The Company is currently unable to assess with any certainty whether it may have any exposure in the Action. The Company believes the plaintiff s claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself in the Action.  
     
  Additionally, the Company is party to certain lawsuits in the normal course of business. In addition, Allied Capital was involved in various legal proceedings that the Company assumed in connection with the Allied Acquisition. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on the Company in connection with the activities of its portfolio companies. It is possible that third parties could try to seek to impose liability against the combined company in connection with the matter discussed above or other potential legal proceedings. While the outcome of any such legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect that these legal proceedings will materially affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.  
     
   16.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   
     
  The Company s management has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements included herein. There have been no subsequent events that occurred during such period that would require disclosure in this Form 10-Q or would be required to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

   OVERVIEW   
     
  We are a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company incorporated in Maryland. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the  Investment Company Act ).  
     
  We are externally managed by Ares Capital Management LLC ( Ares Capital Management  or our  investment adviser ), a subsidiary of Ares Management L.P. (NYSE: ARES) ( Ares Management ), a publicly traded, leading global alternative asset manager, pursuant to our investment advisory and management agreement. Our administrator, Ares Operations LLC ( Ares Operations  or our  administrator ), a subsidiary of Ares Management, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate.  
     
  Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in first lien senior secured loans (including unitranche loans), second lien senior secured loans and mezzanine debt, which in some cases includes an equity component like warrants.  
     
  To a lesser extent, we also make preferred and/or common equity investments, which have generally been non-control equity investments, of less than $20 million (usually in conjunction with a concurrent debt investment). However, we may increase the size or change the nature of these investments.  
     
  Since our initial public offering ( IPO ) on October 8, 2004 through September 30, 2016, our exited investments resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized internal rate of return to us of approximately 13% (based on original cash invested, net of syndications, of approximately $14.0 billion and total proceeds from such exited investments of approximately $17.1 billion). Internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows related to a particular investment equal to zero. Internal rate of return is gross of expenses related to investments as these expenses are not allocable to specific investments. Investments are considered to be exited when the original investment objective has been achieved through the receipt of cash and/or non-cash consideration upon the repayment of a debt investment or sale of an investment or through the determination that no further consideration was collectible and, thus, a loss may have been realized. Approximately 70% of these exited investments resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.  
     
  Additionally, since our IPO on October 8, 2004 through September 30, 2016, our realized gains have exceeded our realized losses by approximately $558 million (excluding a one-time gain on the acquisition of Allied Capital Corporation ( Allied Capital ) and realized gains/losses from the extinguishment of debt and from other assets). For this same time period, our average annualized net realized gain rate was approximately 1.1% (excluding a one-time gain on the acquisition of Allied Capital and realized gains/losses from the extinguishment of debt and from other assets). Net realized gain/loss rates for a particular period are the amount of net realized gains/losses during such period divided by the average quarterly investments at amortized cost in such period.

Table of Contents   
     
  Information included herein regarding internal rates of return, realized gains and losses and annualized net realized gain rates are historical results relating to our past performance and are not necessarily indicative of future results, the achievement of which cannot be assured.  
     
  As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in  qualifying assets,  including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies and certain public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We also may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets, as permitted by the Investment Company Act. Specifically, as part of this 30% basket, we may invest in entities that are not considered  eligible portfolio companies  (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act.  
     
  We have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or a  RIC , under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our stockholders generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Pursuant to this election, we generally will not have to pay U.S. federal corporate-level taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders provided that we satisfy those requirements.  
     
    Pending American Capital Acquisition    
     
  On May 23, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement (the  Merger Agreement ) to acquire American Capital in a cash and stock transaction. As of May 20, 2016, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of the American Capital Acquisition, the transaction had an implied value of approximately $4.0 billion, or $17.40 per fully diluted share of American Capital common stock.  As of September 30, 2016, the transaction had an implied value of approximately $4.0 billion, or $17.55 per fully diluted share of American Capital common stock.  
     
  Upon the completion of the American Capital Acquisition, each share of American Capital common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the American Capital Acquisition will be converted into the right to receive from us, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, (i) $6.41 per share in cash consideration, (ii) stock consideration at the fixed exchange ratio of 0.483 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of our common stock (subject to the payment of cash instead of fractional shares) (the  Exchange Ratio ) (iii) $1.20 per share in cash from Ares Capital Management, acting solely on its own behalf (see Transaction Support Agreement discussed below) and (iv) $2.45 per share in cash, which amount represents the per share cash consideration paid to American Capital pursuant to the sale by American Capital of American Capital Mortgage Management, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of American Capital Asset Management, LLC ( ACAM ), a wholly owned portfolio company of American Capital, to American Capital Agency Corp.  
     
  Additionally, depending on the effective time of the American Capital Acquisition, each share of American Capital common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the American Capital Acquisition will be converted into the right to receive, if any, the make-up dividend amount.  The make-up dividend amount would equal (A) if the closing occurs after the record date with respect to the our dividend payable with respect to our fourth quarter of 2016, 37.5% of the Exchange Ratio times our dividend for such quarter, plus (B) if the closing occurs after the record date with respect to our dividend payable with respect to the first quarter of 2017, 75% of the Exchange Ratio times our dividend for such quarter, plus (C) if the closing occurs after the record date with respect to our dividend for any subsequent quarter, 100% of the Exchange Ratio times our dividend for such quarter.  The Exchange Ratio was fixed on the date of the Merger Agreement, and is not subject to adjustment based on changes in the trading price of our or American Capital s common stock before the closing of the American Capital Acquisition. Based on the number of shares of American Capital common stock outstanding on the date of the Merger Agreement, the above would result in approximately 110.8 million of our shares being exchanged for approximately 229.3 million fully diluted shares of American Capital common stock, subject to adjustment in certain limited circumstances.  
     
  In connection with the American Capital Acquisition, ACAM will merge with and into IHAM, with IHAM remaining as the surviving entity as a wholly owned portfolio company of Ares Capital.

  The Merger Agreement contains (a) customary representations and warranties of American Capital and us, including representations and warranties relating to, among others: corporate organization, capitalization, corporate authority and absence of conflicts, third party and governmental consents and approvals, reports and regulatory matters, financial statements, compliance with law and legal proceedings, absence of certain changes, taxes, employee matters, intellectual property, insurance and certain contracts, (b) limited representations and warranties from IHAM and ACAM, including representations and warranties relating to, among others: corporate organization, capitalization, corporate authority and absence of conflicts, (c) limited representations and warranties from our investment adviser, including representations and warranties relating to, among others: corporate organization, capitalization, corporate authority, absence of conflicts and regulatory matters, (d) covenants of American Capital and us to conduct our respective businesses in the ordinary course until the American Capital Acquisition is completed and (e) covenants of American Capital and ours not to take certain actions during this interim period.  
     
  Among other things, American Capital and we have agreed to, and will cause our respective affiliates, consolidated subsidiaries, and each of their respective officers, directors, managers, employees and other advisors, representatives and agents to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all discussions and negotiations with respect to a Competing Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) from a third party and not to directly or indirectly solicit or take any other action (including providing information) with the intent to solicit any inquiry, discussion, proposal or offer with respect to a Competing Proposal.  
     
  However, if either American Capital or we receive a Competing Proposal from a third party, and the board of directors of American Capital or we, as applicable, determines in good faith after consultation with our outside legal counsel and independent financial advisers that (i) failure to consider such proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors under applicable law and (ii) the Competing Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), then the party receiving such proposal may engage in discussions and negotiations with such third party so long as certain notice and other procedural requirements are satisfied. American Capital or we may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with a third party who makes a Superior Proposal, subject to certain procedural requirements and the payment of a $140 million termination fee.  
     
  The representations and warranties of each party set forth in the Merger Agreement (a) have been qualified by confidential disclosures made to the other party in connection with the Merger Agreement, (b) will not survive completion of the American Capital Acquisition and cannot be the basis for any claims under the Merger Agreement by the other party after the American Capital Acquisition is completed, (c) are qualified in certain circumstances by a materiality standard which may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors, (d) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date as is specified in the Merger Agreement and (e) may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating risk between American Capital and we rather than establishing matters as facts.  
     
  While there can be no assurances as to the exact timing, or that the American Capital Acquisition will be completed at all, we expect to complete the American Capital Acquisition as early as the first week of January 2017. The completion of the American Capital Acquisition is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, American Capital stockholder approval, our stockholder approval, required regulatory approvals (including from certain regulatory authorities), receipt of certain third party consents, including third party consents from certain investment funds managed by ACAM and its subsidiaries representing at least 75% of the aggregate assets under management of all such funds as of March 31, 2016, and other customary closing conditions.  
     
  The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for us and American Capital and provides that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances (including as more specifically described above), American Capital or we may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $140 million.  
     
  Additionally, on May 23, 2016, we entered into an agreement with our investment adviser (the  Transaction Support Agreement ) in connection with the American Capital Acquisition. Under the terms of the Transaction Support Agreement, our investment adviser will (i) provide approximately $275 million of cash consideration, or $1.20 per share of American Capital Common Stock, payable to American Capital stockholders in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement at closing and (ii) waive, for each of the first ten calendar quarters beginning with the first full calendar quarter after the closing of the American Capital Acquisition, the lesser of (x) $10 million of income based fees and (y) the amount of income based fees for such quarter, in each case, to the extent earned and payable by us in such quarter pursuant to and as calculated under our investment advisory and management agreement. The financial support contemplated by the Transaction Support Agreement is conditioned upon completion of the American Capital Acquisition, which is subject to the closing conditions described above.  
     
  Also in connection with the American Capital Acquisition, our consolidated subsidiary, Ares Capital CP Funding LLC ( Ares Capital CP ) received commitments from certain lenders to provide $460.0 million in new commitments under Ares Capital CP s revolving funding facility (as amended, the  Revolving Funding Facility ), which would bring the total commitments of the Revolving Funding Facility to $1.0 billion. The new commitments are conditioned upon completion of the American Capital Acquisition, which is subject to certain closing conditions described above, and also are subject to final documentation of the amendment to the Revolving Funding Facility.

  The weighted average yields at amortized cost and fair value of the following portions of our portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:  

(1)                                     Weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities  is computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on accruing debt and other income producing securities, divided by (b) the total accruing debt and other income producing securities at amortized cost or at fair value as applicable. 
  (2)                                     Weighted average yields  are computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on the relevant accruing debt and other income producing securities, divided by (b) the total relevant investments at amortized cost or at fair value as applicable. 
  (3)                                    The proceeds from these certificates were applied to co-investments with Varagon and its clients to fund first lien senior secured loans.

  Ares Capital Management, our investment adviser, employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. Under this system, investments with a grade of 4 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. Investments graded 3 involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 3. Investments graded 2 indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due. An investment grade of 1 indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 1, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 1, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. For investments graded 1 or 2, our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. The grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time.

  Set forth below is the grade distribution of our portfolio companies as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted average grade of the investments in our portfolio at fair value was 3.0 and 3.0, respectively.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, loans on non-accrual status represented 2.3% and 1.2% of the total investments at amortized cost and at fair value, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, loans on non-accrual status represented 2.6% and 1.7% of the total investments at amortized cost and at fair value, respectively.  
     
    Senior Direct Lending Program    
     
  We established a joint venture with Varagon to make certain first lien senior secured loans, including certain stretch senior and unitranche loans, to U.S. middle-market companies. Varagon was formed in 2013 as a lending platform by American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) and other partners. The joint venture is called the SDLP. In July 2016, the Company and Varagon and its clients completed the initial funding of the SDLP. In conjunction with the initial funding, we and Varagon and its clients sold investment commitments to the SDLP. Such investment commitments included $528.9 million of investment commitments sold to the SDLP by us. No realized gains or losses were recorded by us on these transactions. The SDLP may generally commit and hold individual loans of up to $300.0 million. The SDLP is capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of ours and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required).  
     
  We provide capital to the SDLP in the form of subordinated certificates (the  SDLP Certificates ), and Varagon and its clients provide capital to the SDLP in the form of senior notes, intermediate funding notes and SDLP Certificates. As of September 30, 2016, we and a client of Varagon owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the outstanding SDLP Certificates.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we and Varagon and its clients agreed to make capital available to the SDLP of $2.9 billion in the aggregate, of which $590.6 million has been made available from us. This capital will only be committed to the SDLP upon approval of transactions by the investment committee of the SDLP as discussed above.  Below is a summary of the funded capital and unfunded capital commitments of the SDLP.  

(1)                                    At principal amount. 
  (2)                                    These commitments have been approved by the investment committee of the SDLP and will be funded as the transactions are completed.

  The SDLP Certificates pay a coupon of LIBOR plus 8.0% and also entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the loan portfolio, after expenses, which may result in a return to the holders of the SDLP Certificates that is greater than the stated coupon. The SDLP Certificates are junior in right of payment to the senior notes and intermediate funding notes.  
     
  The amortized cost and fair value of our SDLP Certificates held by us were $195.3 million and $195.3 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2016. Our yield on our investment in the SDLP at amortized cost and fair value was 13.5% and 13.5%, respectively, as of September 30, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we earned interest income of $4.8 million from our investment in the SDLP Certificates for each period. We are also entitled to certain fees in connection with the SDLP. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with the SDLP, we earned capital structuring service and other fees totaling $0.8 million for each period.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the portfolio was comprised of all first lien senior secured loans to U.S. middle-market companies and were in industries similar to the companies in our portfolio. As of September 30, 2016, none of the loans were on non-accrual status. Below is a summary of the SDLP s portfolio as of September 30, 2016:  

(1)                                    At principal amount. 
  (2)                                    Computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate on accruing first lien senior secured loans, divided by (b) total first lien senior secured loans at principal amount. 
  (3)                                    As discussed above, these commitments have been approved by the investment committee of the SDLP. 
     
    Senior Secured Loan Program    
     
  We and GE have co-invested in first lien senior secured loans of middle market companies through the SSLP. The SSLP has been capitalized as transactions are completed. All portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SSLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SSLP consisting of representatives of ours and GE (with approval from a representative of each required). We have provided capital to the SSLP in the form of subordinated certificates (the  SSLP Certificates ). As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we and GE owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of the outstanding SSLP Certificates.  
     
  In August 2015, GE completed the sale of its U.S. Sponsor Finance business, through which GE had participated with us in the SSLP, to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ( CPPIB ). This sale excluded GE s interest in the SSLP, and we and GE continue to operate the SSLP. We and GE no longer have an obligation to present senior secured lending investment opportunities to the SSLP and since June 30, 2015, the SSLP has not made any investments related to new portfolio companies; however, we and GE may provide capital to support the SSLP s funding of existing commitments (see below) and other amounts to its portfolio companies. On August 24, 2015, we were advised that GECC, as the holder of the senior notes of the SSLP (the  Senior Notes ), directed State Street Bank and Trust Company, as trustee of the Senior Notes and the SSLP Certificates, pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes and the SSLP Certificates, to apply all principal proceeds received by the SSLP from its investments to the repayment of the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes until paid in full (prior to the distribution of any such principal proceeds to the holders of the SSLP Certificates, which includes us). GECC had previously elected to waive its right to receive priority repayments on the Senior Notes from principal proceeds in most circumstances. Prior to closing the sale to CPPIB, GE had announced its intention to provide us and CPPIB the opportunity to work together on the SSLP on a go-forward basis. GECC has also stated that if a mutual agreement between us and CPPIB to partner on the SSLP is not reached, it intends to retain its interest in the SSLP and the SSLP would be wound down in an orderly manner. We have been in dialogue with GE and CPPIB to determine if there is an opportunity to work together; however, to date there has been no agreement in respect of the SSLP as a result of these discussions and there can be no assurance that such discussions will continue or any such agreement will be reached.  
     
 103   

Table of Contents   
     
  As discussed above, we anticipate that no new investments will be made by the SSLP and that we and GE will only provide additional capital to support the SSLP s funding of existing commitments and possibly other amounts to its portfolio companies. Below is a summary of the funded capital and unfunded capital commitments of the SSLP.  

(1)                                    At principal amount. 
  (2)                                    These commitments have been approved by the investment committee of the SSLP and will be funded as the transactions are completed. 
     
  The SSLP Certificates have a weighted average contractual coupon of LIBOR plus approximately 8.0% and also entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the loan portfolio, after expenses. However, the SSLP Certificates are junior in right of payment to the Senior Notes held by GE, and we expect that for so long as principal proceeds from SSLP repayments are directed entirely to repay the Senior Notes as discussed above, the yield on the SSLP Certificates will be lower than the stated coupon and continue to decline.  
     
  The amortized cost and fair value of our SSLP Certificates were $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2016, and $2.0 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. Our yield on our investment in the SSLP at amortized cost and fair value was 8.5% and 8.7%, respectively, as of September 30, 2016, and 12.0% and 12.3%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we earned interest income of $49.5 million and $165.9 million, respectively, from our investment in the SSLP Certificates. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we earned interest income of $71.4 million and $209.6 million, respectively, from our investment in the SSLP Certificates.  
     
  We are also entitled to certain fees in connection with the SSLP. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with the SSLP, we earned capital structuring service, sourcing and other fees totaling $4.6 million and $16.0 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, in connection with the SSLP, we earned capital structuring service, sourcing and other fees totaling $8.6 million and $41.8 million, respectively.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the SSLP s portfolio was comprised of all first lien senior secured loans to U.S. middle-market companies and were in industries similar to the companies in our portfolio. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, none of these loans were on non-accrual status. Below is a summary of the SSLP s portfolio.  

(1)                                    At principal amount. 
  (2)                                    Computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate on accruing first lien senior secured loans, divided by (b) total first lien senior secured loans at principal amount. 
  (3)                                    As discussed above, these commitments have been approved by the investment committee of the SSLP.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
     
    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
     
  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

Net income can vary substantially from period to period due to various factors, including acquisitions, the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, comparisons of net increase in stockholders  equity resulting from operations may not be meaningful.

   Investment Income   

The decrease in interest income from investments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average yield of our portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the size of our portfolio. The weighted average yield of our portfolio decreased from 9.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 8.8% for the comparable period in 2016, primarily driven by the decrease in the yield of the SSLP Certificates. The size of our portfolio increased from an average of $8.5 billion at amortized cost for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to an average of $9.0 billion at amortized cost for the comparable period in 2016. The increase in capital structuring service fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015 was due to the increase in the weighted average capital structuring fees received on new investment commitments. Dividend income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included dividends received from IHAM totaling $10.0 million for each period. Also during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we received $3.7 million in other non-recurring dividends from non-income producing equity securities compared to $1.0 million for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease in management and other fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015 was due to lower sourcing fees from the SSLP resulting from a decrease in the size of the SSLP portfolio.

The size of our portfolio increased from an average of $8.5 billion at amortized cost for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to an average of $9.1 billion at amortized cost for the comparable period in 2016. The weighted average yield of our portfolio decreased from 9.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 9.0% for the comparable period in 2016, primarily driven by the decrease in the yield of the SSLP Certificates. The decrease in capital structuring service fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015 was due to the decrease in new investment commitments, which decreased from $2.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.5 billion for the comparable period in 2016, partially offset by the increase in the weighted average capital structuring service fees received on new investment commitments, which increased from 2.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 3.1% for the comparable period in 2016. Dividend income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included dividends received from IHAM totaling $30.0 million and $40.0 million, respectively. The dividends received from IHAM for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included additional dividends of $10.0 million that were paid in addition to the quarterly dividends generally paid by IHAM. IHAM paid the additional dividends out of accumulated earnings that had previously been retained by IHAM. Also during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received $9.8 million in other non-recurring dividends from non-income producing equity securities compared to $4.3 million for the comparable period in 2015.

   Operating Expenses   

Interest and credit facility fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were comprised of the following:  

Stated interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased from the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to the decrease in our weighted average stated interest rate of our debt outstanding. The weighted average stated interest rate on our outstanding debt was 4.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 5.0% for the comparable period in 2015 primarily as a result of the repayment at maturity of our $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% unsecured convertible notes (the  February 2016 Convertible Notes ) and the $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% unsecured convertible notes (the  June 2016 Convertible Notes ), as well as the early repayment of the $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75% unsecured notes (the  2040 Notes ) and increased utilization of our lower cost revolving facilities, including utilization to repay these term notes. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our average principal debt outstanding remained steady at $3.7 billion as compared to the comparable period in 2015. Facility fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased from the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to the increased utilization of our revolving facilities resulting in lower unused commitment fees. Net accretion of discount on notes payable for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased from the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to the maturity of the February 2016 Convertible Notes and the June 2016 Convertible Notes as well as the repayment of the 2040 Notes.  
     
  Stated interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased from the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to the decrease in our weighted average stated interest rate of our debt outstanding, partially offset by an increase in the average principal amount of debt outstanding. The weighted average stated interest rate on our outstanding debt was 4.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 5.1% for the comparable period in 2015 primarily as a result of the repayment upon maturity of the higher cost February 2016 Convertible Notes and June 2016 Convertible Notes as well as the repayment of the 2040 Notes and increased utilization of our lower cost revolving facilities, as discussed above. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our average principal debt outstanding increased to $3.9 billion as compared to $3.6 billion for the comparable period in 2015.  Facility fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased from the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to the increased utilization of our revolving facilities resulting in lower unused commitment fees. Amortization of debt issuance costs and net accretion of discount on notes payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased from the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to the maturity of the February 2016 Convertible Notes and the June 2016 Convertible Notes as well as the repayment of the 2040 Notes.  
     
  The increase in base management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015 was primarily due to the increase in the size of the portfolio. The increase in income based fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015 was primarily due to the increase in net investment income excluding income based fees and capital gains incentive fees.

  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the reduction in capital gains incentive fees calculated in accordance with GAAP was $5.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the capital gains incentive fees expense calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) was $8.7 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the reduction in capital gains incentive fees calculated in accordance with GAAP was $2.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the capital gains incentive fees calculated in accordance with GAAP was $0.8 million. The reduction in capital gains incentive fee expense accrual for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased from the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to net losses on investments, foreign currency and other transactions during the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $27.5 million compared to net losses of $13.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015. Capital gains incentive fee expense accrual for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased from the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to net gains on investments, foreign currency and other transactions and the extinguishment of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $43.5 million compared to net gains of $3.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The capital gains incentive fee accrued under GAAP includes an accrual related to unrealized capital appreciation, whereas the capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement does not. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. As of September 30, 2016, the total capital gains incentive fee accrual calculated in accordance with GAAP was $51.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, there was no capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, for more information on the base management fees, income based fees and capital gains incentive fees.  
     
  Administrative fees represent fees paid to Ares Operations for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Ares Operations in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers and their respective staffs. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees, rent, insurance, depreciation and director s fees, among other costs.  
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $2.6 million and $10.7 million, respectively, in professional fees and other costs related to the American Capital Acquisition that were not incurred in the comparable periods in 2015.  
     
   Income Tax Expense, Including Excise Tax   
     
  We have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must generally (among other requirements) timely distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. In order to maintain our RIC status, we have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal corporate-level income taxes.  
     
  Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. If we determine that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net expense of $2.5 million for U.S. federal excise tax.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net expense of $8.5 million for U.S. federal excise tax, which includes a reduction in expense in the third quarter related to the recording of a requested refund resulting from the overpayment of 2015 excise tax of $1.3 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a net expense of $1.5 million for U.S. federal excise tax. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a net expense of $5.5 million for U.S. federal excise tax, which includes a reduction in expense in the third quarter related to the recording of a requested refund resulting from the overpayment of 2014 excise tax of $1.5 million. 
     
  Certain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a tax expense of approximately $1.1 million and $4.3 million, respectively, for these subsidiaries. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a tax (benefit) expense of approximately $(0.6) million and $1.5 million, respectively, for these subsidiaries.

  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we also recognized net unrealized losses on foreign currency and other transactions of $1.6 million.  
     
   FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
     
  Our liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from the net proceeds of public offerings of equity and debt securities, advances from the Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Funding Facility and the SMBC Funding Facility (each as defined below and together, the  Facilities ), net proceeds from the issuance of other securities, including unsecured notes and Small Business Administration ( SBA )-guaranteed debentures (the  SBA Debentures ), as well as cash flows from operations.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had $125.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.8 billion in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding ($3.7 billion at carrying value). Subject to leverage, borrowing base and other restrictions, we had approximately $1.5 billion available for additional borrowings under the Facilities and the SBA Debentures as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our common stock through cash purchases, as well as retire, cancel or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such incurrence or

  issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the Investment Company Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the Investment Company Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing. On June 21, 2016, we received exemptive relief from the SEC allowing us to modify our calculation of asset coverage requirements to exclude the SBA Debentures. This exemptive relief provides us with increased investment flexibility but also increases our risk related to leverage. As of September 30, 2016, our asset coverage was 236% (excluding the SBA Debentures).  
     
   Equity Capital Activities   
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our total equity market capitalization was $4.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. There were no sales of our equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
  In September 2015, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $100 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. Our stock repurchase program expires on February 28, 2017. The program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares and we cannot assure stockholders that any shares will be repurchased under the program. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. As of September 30, 2016, we had repurchased a total of 514,677 shares of our common stock in the open market under the stock repurchase program since its inception in September 2015, at an average price of $13.92 per share, including commissions paid, leaving approximately $92.8 million available for additional repurchases under the program.  
     
  In connection with our stock repurchase program, in March 2016, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 plan to repurchase shares of our common stock in accordance with certain parameters set forth in such plan. In May 2016, we suspended our stock repurchase program pending the completion of the American Capital Acquisition. See  Pending American Capital Acquisition  above and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 for more information. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased a total of 393,056 shares of our common stock in the open market for $5.5 million under the stock repurchase program. The shares were repurchased at an average price of $13.94 per share, including commissions paid.

    Revolving Credit Facility    
     
  We are party to a senior secured revolving credit facility (as amended and restated, the  Revolving Credit Facility ), which allows us to borrow up to $1,265.0 million at any one time outstanding. For $1,195.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility, the end of the revolving period and the stated maturity date are May 4, 2020 and May 4, 2021, respectively. For the remaining $70 million of the Revolving Credit Facility, the end of the revolving period and the stated maturity date are May 4, 2019 and May 4, 2020, respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for a feature that allowed us, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility to a maximum of $1,897.5 million. The interest rate charged on the Revolving Credit Facility is based on an applicable spread of either 1.75% or 2.00% over LIBOR or 0.75% or 1.00% over an  alternate base rate  (as defined in the agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility), in each case, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the total commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt, if any, secured by the same collateral as the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, the interest rate in effect was LIBOR plus 1.75%. We are also required to pay a letter of credit fee of either 2.00% or 2.25% per annum on letters of credit issued, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the total commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt, if any, secured by the same collateral as the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum on any unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.

The end of the reinvestment period and the stated maturity date for the Revolving Funding Facility is May 14, 2017 and May 14, 2019, respectively. The Revolving Funding Facility also provides for a feature that allows, under certain circumstances, for an increase in the size of the Revolving Funding Facility to a maximum of $865.0 million.

As of September 30, 2016, the interest rate in effect was LIBOR plus 1.75%.

    SBA Debentures    
     
  In April 2015, our wholly owned subsidiary, Ares Venture Finance, L.P. ( AVF LP ), received a license from the SBA to operate as a Small Business Investment Company ( SBIC ) under the provisions of Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. The SBA places certain limitations on the financing of investments by SBICs in portfolio companies, including regulating the types of financings, restricting investments to only include small businesses with certain characteristics or in certain industries, and requiring capitalization thresholds that may limit distributions to us.  
     
  The license from the SBA allows AVF LP to obtain leverage by issuing the SBA Debentures, subject to issuance of a capital commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. Leverage through the SBA Debentures is subject to required capitalization thresholds. Current SBA regulations limit the amount that any SBIC may borrow to $150.0 million and as of September 30, 2016, the amount of the SBA Debentures committed to AVF LP by the SBA was $75.0 million. The SBA Debentures are non-recourse to us, have interest payable semi-annually, have a ten-year maturity and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. As of September 30, 2016, AVF LP had $25.0 million of the SBA Debentures issued and outstanding, which mature between September 2025 and March 2026. As of September 30, 2016, AVF LP was in compliance in all material respects with SBA regulatory requirements.  
     
  The interest rate for the SBA Debentures is fixed at the time the SBA Debentures and other applicable issued SBA-guaranteed debentures can be pooled and sold to the public and is based on a spread over U.S. treasury notes with ten-year maturities. The pooling of newly issued SBA-guaranteed debentures occurs twice per year. The spread includes an annual charge as determined by the SBA (the  Annual Charge ) as well as a market-driven component. Prior to the ten-year fixed interest rate being determined, the interest rate charged for the SBA Debentures is based on LIBOR plus an applicable spread of 0.30% and the Annual Charge. As of September 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate in effect for the SBA Debentures was 3.48%.  
     
    Convertible Unsecured Notes    
     
  We have issued $162.5 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes that mature on March 15, 2017 (the  2017 Convertible Notes ), $270.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes that mature on January 15, 2018 (the  2018 Convertible Notes ) and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes that mature on January 15, 2019 (the  2019 Convertible Notes  and together with the 2017 Convertible Notes and the 2018 Convertible Notes, the  Convertible Unsecured Notes ). The Convertible Notes mature upon their respective maturity dates unless previously converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. We do not have the right to redeem the Convertible Unsecured Notes prior to maturity. The 2017 Convertible Notes, the 2018 Convertible Notes and the 2019 Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.875% , 4.750% and 4.375%, respectively, per year, payable semi-annually.  
     
  In certain circumstances, the Convertible Unsecured Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, at their respective conversion rates (listed below as of September 30, 2016) subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments and the requirements of their respective indenture (the  Convertible Unsecured Notes Indentures ). To the extent the 2017 Convertible Notes are converted, we have elected to settle with a combination of cash and shares of its common stock. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding their respective conversion date (listed below), holders may convert their Convertible Unsecured Notes only under certain circumstances set forth in the respective Convertible Unsecured Notes Indenture. On or after their respective conversion

  dates until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding their respective maturity date, holders may convert their Convertible Unsecured Notes at any time. In addition, if we engage in certain corporate events as described in their respective Convertible Unsecured Notes Indenture, holders of the Convertible Unsecured Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of the Convertible Unsecured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Unsecured Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but excluding, the required repurchase date.  
     
  Certain key terms related to the convertible features for each of the Convertible Unsecured Notes as of September 30, 2016 are listed below.

  The Convertible Unsecured Notes and the Unsecured Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Unsecured Notes and the Unsecured Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not expressly subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.  
     
  See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 for more information on our debt obligations.  
     
   OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   
     
  We have various commitments to fund investments in our portfolio, as described below.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had the following commitments to fund various revolving and delayed draw senior secured and subordinated loans, including commitments to fund which are at (or substantially at) our discretion:  

Included within the total revolving and delayed draw loan commitments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were delayed draw loan commitments totaling $175.0 million and $148.6 million, respectively. Our commitment to fund delayed draw loans is triggered upon the satisfaction of certain pre-negotiated terms and conditions. Generally, the most significant and uncertain term requires the borrower to satisfy a specific use of proceeds covenant. The use of proceeds covenant typically requires the borrower to use the additional loans for the specific purpose of a permitted acquisition or permitted investment, for example. In addition to the use of proceeds covenant, the borrower is generally required to satisfy additional negotiated covenants (including specified leverage levels).  
     
  Also included within the total revolving and delayed draw loan commitments as of September 30, 2016 were commitments to issue up to $53.5 million in letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2016, we had $12.0 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under these  
     
 123   

Table of Contents   
     
  commitments on behalf of the portfolio companies. For all these letters of credit issued and outstanding, we would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. None of these letters of credit issued and outstanding are recorded as a liability on our balance sheet as such letters of credit are considered in the valuation of the investments in the portfolio company. Of these letters of credit, $0.0 million expire in 2016, $12.0 million expire in 2017 and $0.0 million expire in 2018.  
     
  We also have commitments to co-invest in the SDLP and the SSLP for our portion of the SDLP s and the SSLP s commitments to fund delayed draw loans to certain portfolio companies of the SDLP and the SSLP. See  Senior Direct Lending Program  and  Senior Secured Loan Program  above and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 for more information.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we were party to subscription agreements to fund equity investments in private equity investment partnerships as follows:  

In the ordinary course of business, we may sell certain of our investments to third party purchasers. In particular, in connection with the sale of certain controlled portfolio company equity investments (as well as certain other sales), we have, and may continue to do so in the future, agreed to indemnify such purchasers for future liabilities arising from the investments and the related sale transaction. Such indemnification provisions have given rise to liabilities in the past and may do so in the future.  
     
   RECENT DEVELOPMENTS   
     
  On October 18, 2016, we announced that we will hold a special meeting of stockholders on December 15, 2016 to seek approval of various matters necessary to complete the American Capital Acquisition.  On the same date, we also announced that our registration statement on Form N-14, which includes a joint proxy statement of Ares Capital and American Capital and a prospectus of Ares Capital, had been declared effective by the SEC and that the joint proxy statement/prospectus was first being mailed or otherwise delivered to stockholders on or about October 18, 2016. The joint proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the American Capital Acquisition and the related stockholder approvals.  
     
  From October 1, 2016 through October 27, 2016, we made new investment commitments of approximately $73 million, of which $67 million were funded. Of these new commitments, 71% were in second lien senior secured loans and 29% were in first lien senior secured loans. Of the approximately $73 million of new investment commitments, 100% were floating rate. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities funded during the period at amortized cost was 9.7%. We may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.  
     
  From October 1, 2016 through October 27, 2016, we exited approximately $182 million of investment commitments. Of these investment commitments, 43% were second lien senior secured loans, 40% were first lien senior secured loans and 17% were senior subordinated loans. Of the approximately $182 million of exited investment commitments, 60% were fixed rate and 40% were floating rate. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 9.6%. On the approximately $182 million of investment commitments exited from October 1, 2016 through October 27, 2016, we recognized total net realized gains of approximately $21 million.  
     
   In addition, as of October 27, 2016, we had an investment backlog and pipeline of approximately $540 million and $870 million, respectively.  Investment backlog includes transactions approved by our investment adviser s investment committee and/or for which a formal mandate, letter of intent or a signed commitment have been issued, and therefore we believe are likely to close. Investment pipeline includes transactions where due diligence and analysis are in process, but no formal mandate, letter of intent or signed commitment have been issued. The consummation of any of the investments in this backlog and pipeline depends upon, among other things, one or more of the following: satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of the prospective portfolio company, our acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation. In addition, we may sell all or a portion of these investments and certain of these investments may result in the repayment of existing investments. We cannot assure you that we will make any of these investments or that we will sell all or any portion of these investments.  
     
   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
  See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, which describes our critical accounting policies and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet required to be adopted by us.

Table of Contents   
     
   Item 3.                        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
     
  We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio.  
     
    Interest Rate Risk    
     
  Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, 80% of the investments at fair value in our portfolio bore interest at variable rates, 10% bore interest at fixed rates, 9% were non-interest earning and 1% were on non-accrual status. Additionally, for the variable rate investments, 69% of these investments contained interest rate floors (representing 55% of total investments at fair value). Also, as of September 30, 2016, all the loans made through the SSLP and SDLP contained interest rate floors. The Facilities all bear interest at variable rates with no interest rate floors, while the SBA Debentures, the Unsecured Notes and the Convertible Unsecured Notes bear interest at fixed rates.  
     
  We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates.  
     
  While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively hedge our interest rate risk.  
     
  Based on our September 30, 2016, balance sheet, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:  

(1)                                    Excludes the impact of income based fees. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 for more information on the income based fees.

   Item 4.                        Controls and Procedures    
     
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  
     
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  
     
   PART II   OTHER INFORMATION     
     
   Item 1.                        Legal Proceedings    
     
  For a description of our legal proceedings, see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   Item 1A.               Risk Factors.    
     
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors described in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and those set forth under the caption  Risk Factors  in pre-effective Amendment No. 2 to our Registration Statement on Form N-14, filed on October 13, 2016 (the  N-14 ), which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the N-14 are not the only risks facing us.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

  During nine months ended September 30, 2016, as a part of our dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders, we purchased 1,218,544 shares of our common stock for an average price per share of $14.45 in the open market in order to satisfy the reinvestment portion of our dividends. The following chart outlines such purchases of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Stock Repurchase Program    
     
  In September 2015, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $100 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below its net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. The program will be in effect until February 28, 2017, unless extended or until the approved dollar amount has been used to repurchase shares. The program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares and it cannot assure stockholders that any shares will be repurchased under the program. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time.  
     
  In May 2016, in connection with the American Capital Acquisition, we suspended our stock repurchase program pending the completion of the American Capital Acquisition.  
     
  Repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program were as follows:
