Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)   

1 - GENERAL INFORMATION 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Genco Shipping   Trading Limited ( GS T ) and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Baltic Trading Limited (collectively, the  Company ). The Company is engaged in the ocean transportation of drybulk cargoes worldwide through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels. GS T is incorporated under the laws of the Marshall Islands, and as of September 30, 2016, is the sole owner of all of the outstanding shares or limited liability company interests of the following subsidiaries: Genco Ship Management LLC; Genco Investments LLC; Genco RE Investments LLC; and the ship-owning subsidiaries as set forth below under  Other General Information.   As of September 30, 2016, Genco Ship Management LLC is the sole owner of all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Genco Management (USA) LLC. 

On April 15, 2016, the shareholders of the Company approved, at a Special Meeting of Shareholders (the  Special Meeting ), proposals to amend the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company to (i) increase the number of authorized shares of common stock of the Company from 250,000,000 to 500,000,000 and (ii) authorize the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more classes or series as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company. The authorized shares did not change as a result of the reverse stock split.   Following the Special Meeting on such date, the Company filed Articles of Amendment of its Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Registrar of Corporations of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to implement to the foregoing amendments. Additionally, at the Special Meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved a proposal to amend the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company to effect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at a ratio between 1-for-2 and 1-for-25 with such reverse stock split to be effective at such time and date, if at all, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, but no later than one year after shareholder approval thereof  .   

On July 7, 2016, the Company completed a one-for-ten reverse stock split of its common stock.  As a result, all share and per share information included for all periods presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements, with the exception of any share information for Baltic Trading, reflect the reverse stock split.  Refer to Note 6   Net Loss per Common Share and Note 18   Stock-Based Compensation.   

On October 13, 2016, Peter C. Georgiopoulos resigned as Chairman of the Board and a director of the Company.  The Board of Directors appointed Arthur L. Regan, a current director of the Company, as Interim Executive Chairman of the Board.  In connection with his departure, Mr. Georgiopoulos entered into a Separation Agreement and a Release Agreement with the Company on October 13, 2016.  Under the terms of these agreements, subject to customary conditions, Mr. Georgiopoulos is to receive an amount equal to the annual Chairman s fee awarded to him in recent years of $500 as a severance payment and full vesting of his unvested equity awards, which consist of grants of 68,581 restricted shares of the Company s common stock and warrants exercisable for approximately 213,937 shares of the Company s common stock with an exercise price per share ranging $259.10 to $341.90.  Refer to Note 18   Stock-Based Compensation.  The agreements also contain customary provisions pertaining to confidential information, releases of claims by Mr. Georgiopoulos, and other restrictive covenants. 

Liquidity, Going Concern, and Reclassification of Debt to Current 

For purposes of preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ), the Company is required to disclose if it is in compliance with covenants under all of its nine credit facilities on a quarterly basis.  Pursuant to the Second Amended Commitment Letter, the Amended $98 Million Credit Facility Commitment Letter and the waiver entered into for the 2014 Term Loan Facilities (refer to Note 8   Debt for defined terms), the collateral maintenance and maximum leverage requirements under all nine of the Company s credit facilities have been waived through September 30, 2016, with the exception of the Amended $98 Million Credit Facility Commitment Letter, which reduced the collateral maintenance requirement from   

9 

Table of Contents  

140% to 120% and the 2014 Term Loan Facilities, for which the waivers were extended through November 15, 2016, except that such extended waivers under the 2014 Term Loan Facilities will be void if Sinosure gives written notice to the agent bank that it does not approve the waivers.  Each of the Company s credit facilities contain cross default provisions that could be triggered by the Company s failure to satisfy or waive its collateral maintenance and maximum leverage covenants once the waivers expire.  Given the existence of the cross default provisions and the absence of any current solution which would cure the noncompliance for at least the next twelve months, absent entering into the New Facility (see Note 8   Debt), the Company has determined that it should classify its outstanding indebtedness as a current liability as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Persistent weak drybulk industry conditions and historically low charter rates have negatively impacted the Company s results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity and may continue to do so in the future. The negative impact on the Company s liquidity, together with a continued decline in vessel values, presents difficulties for remaining in compliance with its credit facility covenants relating to minimum cash, leverage ratios, and collateral maintenance (refer to Note 8   Debt), which could potentially result in defaults and acceleration of the repayment of its outstanding indebtedness.  These factors, as well as recurring losses from operations and negative working capital, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and extinguishment of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other things, its ability to: (i) develop and successfully implement a plan to address these factors, which may include refinancing the Company s existing credit agreements, or obtaining further waivers or modifications to its credit agreements from its lenders, or raising additional capital through selling assets (including vessels), reducing or delaying capital expenditures, or pursuing other options that may be available to the Company which may include pursuing strategic opportunities and equity or debt offerings or potentially seeking protection in a Chapter 11 proceeding; (ii) return to profitability, (iii) generate sufficient cash flow from operations, (iv) remain in compliance with its credit facility covenants, as the same may be modified, and (v) obtain financing sources to meet the Company s future obligations. Refer to  Commitment Letter  section in Note 8   Debt for a discussion of the New Facility   for an aggregate principal amount of up to $400,000.    The realization of the Company s assets and the satisfaction of its liabilities are subject to uncertainty.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any direct adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, except in regards to the classification of outstanding indebtedness as described above. 

Merger Agreement with Baltic Trading 

On April 7, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Baltic Trading Limited ( Baltic Trading ) under which the Company acquired Baltic Trading in a stock-for-stock transaction (the  Merger ).  Under the terms of the agreement, Baltic Trading became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Baltic Trading shareholders (other than the Company and its subsidiaries) received 0.216 shares of the Company s common stock for each share of Baltic Trading s common stock they owned at closing, with fractional shares to be settled in cash.  Upon consummation of the transaction on July 17, 2015, the Company s shareholders owned approximately 84.5% of the combined company, and Baltic Trading s shareholders (other than the Company and its subsidiaries) owned approximately 15.5% of the combined company.  Shares of Baltic Trading s Class B stock (all of which are owned by the Company) were canceled in the Merger.  The Company s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange after consummation of the transaction on July 20, 2015. The Boards of Directors of both the Company and Baltic Trading established independent special committees to review the transaction and negotiate the terms on behalf of their respective companies.  Both independent special committees unanimously approved the transaction.  The Boards of Directors of both companies approved the Merger by a unanimous vote of directors present and voting, with Peter C. Georgiopoulos, former Chairman of the Board of each company, recused for the vote.  The Merger was approved on July 17, 2015 at the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the  Annual Meeting ). 

Prior to the completion of the Merger, the Company prepared its condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and consolidated the operations of Baltic Trading. The Baltic Trading common shares that the Company acquired in the Merger were previously recognized as a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Under U.S. GAAP, changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do   

10 

Table of Contents  

not result in the parent losing control of the subsidiary are considered equity transactions (i.e. transactions with owners in their capacity as owners) with any difference between the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid attributed to the equity of the parent. Accordingly, any difference between the fair value of the Company s common shares issued in exchange for Baltic Trading common shares pursuant to the Merger was reflected as an adjustment to the equity in the Company. No gain or loss has been recognized in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss upon completion of the transaction. 

Acquisition of Baltic Lion and Baltic Tiger 

Additionally, on April 7, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement under which the Company acquired all of the shares of two single-purpose vessel owning entities that were wholly owned by Baltic Trading, each of which owned one Capesize drybulk vessel, specifically the Baltic Lion and Baltic Tiger, for an aggregate purchase price of $68,500, subject to reduction for $40,563 of outstanding first-mortgage debt of such single-purpose entities that was guaranteed by the Company.  For further details, refer to the  Impairment of vessel assets  Section in Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  These transactions, which closed on April 8, 2015, were accounted for pursuant to accounting guidance under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805,  Business Combinations  ( ASC 805 ), for transactions among entities under common control.  Accordingly, the difference between the cash paid to Baltic Trading and the Company s carrying value of the Baltic Lion and Baltic Tiger as of the closing date of $590 was reflected as an adjustment to Additional paid-in capital in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Equity when the sale was completed on April 7, 2015.  The independent special committees of both companies  Boards of Directors reviewed and approved these transactions.

The Company formerly provided technical services for drybulk vessels purchased by Maritime Equity Partners ( MEP ).  Peter C. Georgiopoulos, former Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a director of and has a minority interest in MEP.  These services included oversight of crew management, insurance, drydocking, ship operations and financial statement preparation, but did not include chartering services.  The services were initially provided for a fee of $750 per ship per day plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs and were provided for an initial term of one year.   On September 30, 2015, under the oversight of an independent committee of our Board of Directors, Genco Management (USA) LLC and MEP entered into certain agreements under which MEP paid $2,178 of the amount of service fees in arrears (of which $261 was paid in 2016 by the new owners of five of the MEP vessels sold in January 2016 as described below) and the daily service fee was reduced from $750 to $650 per day effective on October 1, 2015. During January 2016, five of MEP s vessels were sold to third parties and were no longer subject to the agency agreement.  Based upon the September 30, 2015 agreement, termination fees were due in the amount of $296 which was assumed by the new owners of the five MEP vessels that were sold and were paid in full during February 2016.  Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, the remaining seven of MEP s vessels were sold to third parties, and the agency agreement was deemed terminated upon the sale of these vessels.  Based upon the September 30, 2015 agreement, termination fees were due in the amount of $830, which was assumed by the new owners of the seven MEP vessels that were sold and were paid in full as of September 30, 2016.  Refer to Note 7   Related Party Transactions for amounts due to or from MEP as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Principles of consolidation 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP which includes the accounts of GS T and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Baltic Trading.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Basis of presentation 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).  In the opinion of management of the Company, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and operating results have been included in the statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 10-K ).  The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

Segment reporting 

The Company reports financial information and evaluates its operations by charter revenues and not by the length of ship employment for its customers, i.e., spot or time charters.  Each of the Company s vessels serve the same type of customer, have similar operations and maintenance requirements, operate in the same regulatory environment, and are subject to similar economic characteristics. Based on this, the Company has determined that it operates in one reportable segment, after the effective date of the Merger on July 17, 2015, which is engaged in the ocean transportation of drybulk cargoes worldwide through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels.  Prior to the Merger, the Company had two reportable operating segments, GS T and Baltic Trading.

Vessels, net 

Vessels, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Included in vessel costs are acquisition costs directly attributable to the acquisition of a vessel and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage. The Company also capitalizes interest costs for a vessel under construction as a cost which is directly attributable to the acquisition of a vessel. Vessels are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, determined to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard. Depreciation expense for vessels for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $17,077 and $19,172, respectively.  Depreciation expense for vessels for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $54,752 and $56,869, respectively. 

Depreciation expense is calculated based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value. The costs of significant replacements, renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the vessel s remaining estimated useful life or the estimated life of the renewal or betterment. Undepreciated cost of any asset component being replaced that was acquired after the initial vessel purchase is written off as a component of vessel operating expense. Expenditures for routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Scrap value is estimated by the Company by taking the estimated scrap value of $310 per lightweight ton ( lwt ) times the weight of the ship noted in lwt.   

Vessels held for sale 

On September 30, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of the Genco Sugar and Genco Pioneer.  As such, these vessel assets have been classified as held for sale in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016.  Refer to Note 4   Vessel Acquisitions and Dispositions and Note 20   Subsequent Events for additional information. 

Deferred revenue 

Deferred revenue primarily relates to cash received from charterers prior to it being earned. These amounts are recognized as income when earned. Additionally, deferred revenue includes estimated customer claims mainly due to time charter performance issues. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had an accrual of $398 and $498, respectively, related to these estimated customer claims. 

Voyage expense recognition 

In time charters, spot market-related time charters and pool agreements, operating costs including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel and specified voyage costs such as fuel and port charges are paid by the charterer. There are certain other non-specified voyage expenses, such as commissions, which are typically borne by the Company. At the inception of a time charter, the Company records the difference between the cost of bunker fuel delivered by the terminating charterer and the bunker fuel sold to the new charterer as a gain or loss within voyage expenses. Additionally, the Company records lower of cost or market adjustments to re-value the bunker fuel on a quarterly basis.  These differences in bunkers, including lower of cost or market adjustments, resulted in a net loss of $390 and $3,099 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  These differences in bunkers, including lower of cost or market adjustments, resulted in a net loss of $4,195 and $6,957 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Additionally, voyage expenses include the cost of bunkers consumed during short-term time charters pursuant to the terms of the time charter agreement. 

Other operating income 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded other operating income of $0 and $182, respectively.  There was no operating income earned during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Other operating income recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consists primarily of $157 received from Samsun Logix Corporation ( Samsun ) pursuant to the revised rehabilitation plan that was approved by the South Korean courts on April 8, 2016.  Refer to Note 17   Commitments and Contingencies for further information regarding the bankruptcy settlement with Samsun.

Impairment of vessel assets 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not record any impairment of vessel assets in accordance with ASC 360    Property, Plant and Equipment  ( ASC 360 ).  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $69,278 and $35,396, respectively, related to the impairment of vessel assets in accordance with ASC 360.   

At June 8, 2016, the Company determined that the scrapping of nine of its vessels, the Genco Acheron, Genco Carrier, Genco Leader, Genco Pioneer, Genco Prosperity, Genco Reliance, Genco Success, Genco Sugar, and Genco Wisdom, was more likely than not pursuant to the Commitment Letter entered into for the New Credit Facility as defined and disclosed in Note 8   Debt.  Therefore, at June 8, 2016, the time utilized to determine the recoverability of the carrying value of the vessel assets was significantly reduced.  After determining that the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the aforementioned nine vessels did not exceed the carrying value of the vessels at June 8, 2016, the Company reduced the carrying value of the nine vessels to their net realizable value, which was based on the expected net proceeds from scrapping the vessels.  This resulted in an impairment loss of $67,594 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

At March 31, 2016, the Company determined that the scrapping of the Genco Marine was more likely than not based on discussions with the Company s Board of Directors.  Therefore, at March 31, 2016, the time utilized to determine the recoverability of the carrying value of the vessel asset was significantly reduced.  After determining that the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the Genco Marine did not exceed the carrying value of the vessel at March 31, 2016, the Company reduced the carrying value of the Genco Marine to its net realizable value, which was based on the expected proceeds from scrapping the vessel.  This resulted in an impairment loss of   $1,684   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  On April 5, 2016, the Board of Directors unanimously approved scrapping the Genco Marine and the sale of the Genco Marine to the scrap yard was completed on May 17, 2016.   

At March 31, 2015, the Company determined that the sale of the Baltic Lion and Baltic Tiger was more likely than not based on Baltic Trading s expressed consideration to divest of those vessels.  Therefore, at March 31, 2015, the time utilized to determine the recoverability of the carrying value of the vessel assets was significantly reduced.  Similarly, after determining that the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the Baltic Lion and Baltic Tiger would not exceed the carrying value of the respective vessels at March 31, 2015, the Company reduced the carrying value of both vessels to their estimated fair value, which was determined primarily based on appraisals and third-party broker quotes. This resulted in an impairment loss of $35,396 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On April 8, 2015, the Baltic Lion and Baltic Tiger entities were sold to GS T.   Refer to Note 1   General Information for details pertaining to the sale of these entities.

Noncontrolling interest 

Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $7,178 and $59,471, respectively, reflects the noncontrolling interest s share of the net loss of the Company s subsidiary, Baltic Trading, prior to the Merger on July 17, 2015, which owned and employed drybulk vessels in the spot market, in vessel pools or on spot market-related time charters.  The spot market represents immediate chartering of a vessel, usually for single voyages.    Refer to Note 1  General Information for details pertaining to the Merger.

Investments 

The Company holds an investment in the capital stock of Jinhui Shipping and Transportation Limited ( Jinhui ) and in Korea Line Corporation ( KLC ).  Jinhui is a drybulk shipping owner and operator focused on the Supramax segment of drybulk shipping.  KLC is a marine transportation service company which operates a fleet of carriers which includes carriers for iron ore, liquefied natural gas and tankers for oil and petroleum products.  The investments in Jinhui and KLC have been designated as Available For Sale ( AFS ) and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ).

Investments are reviewed quarterly to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with ASC Subtopic 320-10,  Investments   Debt and Equity Securities  ( ASC 320-10 ).  When evaluating its investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below the cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, the underlying net asset value of the issuer s assets and liabilities, and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.  Should the decline in the value of any investment be deemed to be other-than-temporary, the investment basis would be written down to fair market value, and the write-down would be recorded to earnings as a loss.  Refer to Note 5   Investments.

Recent accounting pronouncements 

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   This ASU adds or clarifies the guidance in ASC 230   Statement of Cash Flows regarding the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted.  This ASU shall be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, but may be applied prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  which replaces the existing guidance in ASC 840   Leases.  This ASU requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases.  Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.  Lessees and lessors will be required to apply the new standard at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements in which they first apply the new guidance, using a modified retrospective transition method. The requirements of this standard include a significant increase in required disclosures. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ). This ASU will require that equity investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income (loss). ASU 2016-01 will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15 ( ASU 2015-15 ), which amends presentation and disclosure requirements outlined in ASU 2015-03,  Interest-Imputation of Interest (ASC Subtopic 835-30):  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  ( ASU 2015-03 ) by clarifying guidance for debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements by acknowledging the statement by SEC staff that it would not object to presentation of debt issuance costs related to a line of credit arrangement as an asset, and amortizing them ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there were any borrowings outstanding under the agreement. Issued in April 2015, ASU 2015-03 required debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts.  Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were required to be presented as deferred charge assets, separate from the related debt liability. ASU 2015-03 does not change the recognition and measurement requirements for debt issuance costs. ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 during the three months ended March 31, 2016 on a retrospective basis. Refer to Note 8   Debt. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, and shall be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. On July 9, 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date.  The FASB also

permitted early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016.   The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this adoption on its consolidated financial statements.      Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB issued the following ASU s which amend or provide additional guidance on topics addressed in ASU 2014-09.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue Recognition - Principal versus Agent  (reporting revenue gross versus net). In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue Recognition - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licenses.    Lastly, in May 2016, the FASB issued No. ASU 2016-12,  Revenue Recognition - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.    The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents  

of $6,127 and $12,273, respectively, based on the last closing price during each respective quarter on September 30, 2016 and December 30, 2015, respectively.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held 3,355 shares of KLC stock which is recorded at its fair value of $64 and $54, respectively, based on the last closing price during each respective quarter on September 30, 2016 and December 30, 2015. 

The Company reviews the investment in Jinhui for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with ASC 320-10. Based on the Company s review, it deemed the investment in Jinhui to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 due to the duration and severity of the decline in its market value versus its cost basis and the absence of the intent and ability to recover the initial carrying value of the investment.  As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations of $2,696 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company will continue to review its investments in Jinhui and KLC for impairment on a quarterly basis.  There were no impairment charges during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $32,536 of impairment charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

As part of fresh-start reporting, the Company revised its cost basis for its investments in Jinhui and KLC based on their fair values on the Effective Date. As a result of the other-than-temporary impairment of the investment in Jinhui, the cost basis for the investment in Jinhui going forward will be based on its fair value as of June 30, 2016. 

Refer to Note 9   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for a breakdown of the components of AOCI, including the effects of any sales of Jinhui shares and other-than-temporary impairment of the investment in Jinhui.  

6 - NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE 

The computation of basic net loss per share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. The computation of diluted net loss per share assumes the vesting of nonvested stock awards (refer to Note 18   Stock-Based Compensation), for which the assumed proceeds upon vesting are deemed to be the amount of compensation cost attributable to future services and are not yet recognized using the treasury stock method, to the extent dilutive.  Of the 164,910 nonvested shares outstanding, including RSUs, at September 30, 2016 (refer to Note 18   Stock-Based Compensation), all are anti-dilutive. Of the 2,852,487 of MIP Warrants and 3,936,761 of equity warrants outstanding at September 30, 2016, all are anti-dilutive.  The Company s diluted net loss per share will also reflect the assumed conversion of the equity warrants issued on the Effective Date and MIP Warrants issued by the Company (refer to Note 18   Stock-Based Compensation) if the impact is dilutive under the treasury stock method.   

On July 7, 2016, the Company completed a one-for-ten reverse stock split of its common stock.  As a result, all share and per share information included for all periods presents in these condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the reverse stock split.

This amendment extended the collateral maintenance waivers under the Prior Facilities through 11:59 p.m. on September 30, 2016, which were further extended to October 7, 2016 pursuant to an additional agreement entered into with the lenders on September 30, 2016.

Additionally, the Second Amended Commitment Letter (as defined below), as well as the Amended $98 Million Credit Facility Commitment Letter (refer to the  $98 Million Credit Facility  section below) provided for waivers of the Company s company-wide minimum cash covenants, so long as cash and cash equivalents of the Company are at least $25,000, and of the Company s maximum leverage ratio through November 15, 2016.

The Amended Commitment Letter also conditioned such waivers on the Company entering into a definitive purchase agreement or file a registration statement for an equity financing by 11:59 p.m. on August 15, 2016.

On October 6, 2016, the Company entered into a second amendment and restatement of the Commitment Letter (the  Second Amended Commitment Letter ).  This amendment further extended the collateral maintenance waivers under the Prior Facilities through November 15, 2016. As a condition to the effectiveness of the Second Amended Commitment Letter, the Company entered into stock purchase agreements (the  Purchase Agreements ) effective as of October 4, 2016 with funds or related entities managed by Centerbridge, SVP and Apollo (the  Investors ) for the purchase of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for an aggregate of up to $125,000 in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The Series A Preferred Stock to be sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreements  will be automatically and mandatorily convertible into the Company s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, upon approval by the Company s shareholders of such conversion.  The purchase price of the Series A Preferred Stock under each of the Purchase Agreements is $4.85 per share.  An additional 1,288,660 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be issued to Centerbridge, SVP and Apollo as a commitment fee on a pro rata basis.  The purchase price and the other terms and conditions of the transaction were established in arm s length negotiations between an independent special committee of the Board of the Directors of the Company (the  Special Committee ).  The Special Committee unanimously approved the transaction. 

Under the Purchase Agreements, Centerbridge made a firm commitment to purchase 6,597,938 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $32,000, SVP made a firm commitment to purchase 7,628,866 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $37,000, and Apollo made a firm commitment to purchase 3,587,629 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $17,400.

Company agrees to issue Series A Preferred Stock in an additional private placement to third parties, the aggregate amount purchased by Centerbridge, SVP and Apollo may be reduced pro rata by up to $38,600 in Series A Preferred Stock. 

Subsequently, on October 27, 2016, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the  Additional Purchase Agreement ) with certain of the Investors; John C. Wobensmith, the Company s President; and other investors for the sale of shares of Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $38,600 at a purchase price of $4.85 per share.  The purchase price and the other terms and conditions of these transactions were established in arm s length negotiations between an independent special committee of the board of directors of the Company (the  Special Committee ) and the investors.  The Special Committee unanimously approved the transactions. 

Collateral Maintenance and Maximum Leverage Ratio Compliance 

The Company is required to be in compliance with covenants under all of its nine credit facilities on a quarterly basis. Pursuant to the Second Amended Commitment Letter, the Amended $98 Million Credit Facility Commitment Letter (as defined below), and the waiver entered into for the 2014 Term Loan Facilities (as described below), the collateral maintenance requirements and maximum leverage requirements under all nine of the Company s credit facilities has been waived through November 15, 2016, with the exception of the $98 Million Credit Facility Commitment Letter which reduced the collateral maintenance requirement from 140% to 120% and the 2014 Term Loan Facilities, for which the waivers were extended through November 15, 2016, except that such extended waivers under the 2014 Term Loan Facilities will be void if Sinosure gives written notice to the agent bank that it does not approve the waivers.  Each of the Company s credit facilities contain cross default provisions that could be triggered by the Company s failure to satisfy its collateral maintenance and maximum leverage covenants once the waivers expire.  Given the existence of the cross default provisions,   the Company believed it was probable that it would not be in compliance with certain covenants at measurement dates within the next twelve months absent entering into the New Facility described above.  As such,   the Company has determined that it should classify its outstanding indebtedness as a current liability as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Amendment and Consent Agreements Related to the Merger 

On July 14, 2015, Baltic Trading and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into agreements (the  Amendment and Consent Agreements ) to amend, provide consents under, or waive certain provisions of the $22 Million Term Loan Facility (as defined below), 2014 Term Loan Facilities (as defined below) and the $148 Million Credit Facility (as defined below) (each a  Facility  and collectively the  Facilities ).

The calculation of the minimum consolidated net worth was reduced by $30,730 to $270,150 under each Facility to account for the reduction of equity due to the impairment associated with the sale of the Baltic Tiger and Baltic Lion vessels.     

The measurement of the maximum leverage ratio under each Facility was amended to exclude from the numerator thereof (which is the amount of indebtedness included in the calculation of such financial covenant) any committed but undrawn working capital lines.

Following completion of the Merger on July 17, 2015, all corporate wide financial covenants of Baltic Trading are to be measured on a consolidated basis with the Company (the  Consolidated Covenant Amendments ).     

Waivers or consents under the Facilities to permit the delisting of Baltic Trading s stock on the New York Stock Exchange (which constitutes a change of control under each such Facility) and the termination of the Management Agreement, dated as of March 15, 2010, by and between GS T and Baltic Trading.     

Waivers or consents under each of the Facilities to permit the Merger.     

Waivers or consents to certain covenants under each of the Facilities to the extent such covenants would otherwise be breached as a result of the Merger.     

On July 17, 2015, when the Merger was completed, the Company executed a guaranty of the obligations of the borrowers (other than to the extent the Company was a borrower) under each of the Facilities.  The execution of the guarantees, together with certain other items that were previously delivered, satisfied all conditions to the effectiveness of all provisions of the Amendment and Consent Agreements.

10 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The fair values and carrying values of the Company s financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 which are required to be disclosed at fair value, but not recorded at fair value, are noted below. 

The fair value of the floating rate debt under the $100 Million Term Loan Facility and the $253 Million Term Loan Facility are based on rates obtained upon our emergence from Chapter 11 on the Effective Date and there were no changes to rates pursuant to the April 2015 Amendments. The fair value of the floating rate debt under the $44 Million Term Loan Facility is based on rates that Baltic Trading initially obtained on the effective date of this facility, and there were no changes pursuant to the Guarantee and Indemnity entered into by the Company during April 2015.  The fair value of the floating rate debt under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility and the $98 Million Credit Facility are based on rates the Company recently obtained upon the effective date of these facilities on April 7, 2015 and November 4, 2015, respectively.   The fair value of the $148 Million Credit Facility, $22 Million Term Loan Facility and the 2014 Term Loan Facilities is based on rates that Baltic Trading initially obtained upon the effective dates of these facilities which did not change pursuant to the Amendment and Consent Agreements effective on July 14, 2015. Refer to Note 8   Debt for further information.  The carrying value approximates the fair market value for these floating rate loans.  The carrying amounts of the Company s other financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (principally Due from charterers and Accounts payable and accrued expenses), approximate fair values because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments.  

ASC Subtopic 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements   Disclosures  ( ASC 820-10 ), applies to all assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis.  This guidance enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumption (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3 requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows: 

Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the Company is able to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these instruments does not entail a significant degree of judgment.     

Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.     

36 

Table of Contents  

Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.     

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities are categorized as follows: 

The Company holds an investment in the capital stock of Jinhui, which is classified as a long-term investment.  The stock of Jinhui is publicly traded on the Oslo Stock Exchange and is considered a Level 1 item.  The Company also holds an investment in the stock of KLC, which is classified as a long-term investment.  The stock of KLC is publicly traded on the Korea Stock Exchange and is considered a Level 1 item.  Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are considered Level 1 items as they represent liquid assets with short-term maturities. Floating rate debt is considered to be a Level 2 item as the Company considers the estimate of rates it could obtain for similar debt or based upon transactions amongst third parties. The Company did not have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

11 - PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT AND NONCURRENT ASSETS 

Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following: 

Other noncurrent assets in the amount of $514 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 represent the security deposit related to the operating lease entered into effective April 4, 2011. Refer to Note 17   Commitments and Contingencies for further information related to the lease agreement. 

12 - DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS

The Company applied this guidance for all of its credit facilities with the exception of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility and the revolving credit facility portion of the $148 Million Credit Facility, which represent revolving credit agreements which are not addressed in ASU 2015-03.  Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016, $7,821 of deferred financing costs were presented as a direct deduction within the outstanding debt balance in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Effective April 4, 2011, the Company entered into a seven-year sub-sublease agreement for additional office space in New York, New York.  The term of the sub-sublease commenced June 1, 2011, with a free base rental period until October 31, 2011. Following the expiration of the free base rental period, the monthly base rental payments were $82 per month until May 31, 2015 and thereafter will be $90 per month until the end of the seven-year term.  Pursuant to

the sub-sublease agreement, the sublessor was obligated to contribute $472 toward the cost of the Company s alterations to the sub-subleased office space.  The Company has also entered into a direct lease with the over-landlord of such office space that will commence immediately upon the expiration of such sub-sublease agreement, for a term covering the period from May 1, 2018 to September 30, 2025; the direct lease provides for a free base rental period from May 1, 2018 to September 30, 2018.  Following the expiration of the free base rental period, the monthly base rental payments will be $186 per month from October 1, 2018 to April 30, 2023 and $204 per month from May 1, 2023 to September 30, 2025.  For accounting purposes, the sub-sublease agreement and direct lease agreement with the landlord constitutes one lease agreement.  As a result of the straight-line rent calculation generated by the free rent period and the tenant work credit, the monthly straight-line rental expense for the term of the entire lease from June 1, 2011 to September 30, 2025 was $130 prior to the Effective Date. On the Effective Date, a revised straight-line rent calculation was completed as part of fresh-start reporting. The revised monthly straight-line rental expense for the remaining term of the lease from the Effective Date to September 30, 2025 is $150.  The Company had a long-term lease obligation at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of $1,688 and $1,149, respectively.  Rent expense pertaining to this lease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $452 and $452, respectively, and $1,356 and $1,356 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively during both periods.  

Future minimum rental payments on the above lease for the next five years and thereafter are as follows: $269 for the remainder of 2016, $1,076 for 2017, $916 for 2018, $2,230 annually for 2019 and 2020 and a total of $11,130 for the remaining term of the lease. 

On August 10, 2016, the Company settled its outstanding lease liability related to its previous office space which the Company had filed a motion to reject in the bankruptcy proceedings.  The motion was accepted on the Effective Date upon the Company s emergence from Chapter 11. The settlement of this claim resulted in a gain that was recorded in rent expense in the amount of ($116) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

During the beginning of 2009, the Genco Cavalier, a 2007-built Supramax vessel, was on charter to Samsun when Samsun filed for the equivalent of bankruptcy protection in South Korea, otherwise referred to as a rehabilitation application.  On July 3, 2015, Samsun filed for rehabilitation proceedings for the second time with the South Korean courts due to financial distress.  On April 8, 2016, the revised rehabilitation plan was approved by the South Korean court whereby 26% of the remainder of the $3,979 unpaid cash claim settlement from the prior rehabilitation plan, or $1,035, will be settled pursuant to a payment plan over the next ten-year period.  The remaining 74% of the claim will be converted to Samsun Shares.  Refer to Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for Other Operating Income recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

18 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

On July 7, 2016, the Company completed a one-for-ten reverse stock split of its common stock.  As a result, all share and per share information included for all periods presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the reverse stock split.   

On October 13, 2016, Peter C. Georgiopoulos resigned as Chairman of the Board and a director of the Company.  In connection with his departure, Mr. Georgiopoulos entered into a Separation Agreement and a Release Agreement with the Company on October 13, 2016.  Under the terms of these agreements, subject to customary conditions, Mr. Georgiopoulos is to receive an amount equal to the annual Chairman s fee awarded to him in recent years of $500 as a severance payment and full vesting of his unvested equity awards, which consist of grants of 68,581 restricted shares of the Company s common stock and warrants exercisable for approximately 213,937 shares of the Company s common stock with an exercise price per share ranging $259.10 to $341.90. The Company is currently evaluating the effect on its consolidated financial statements during the three months ended December 31, 2016.  

2014 Management Incentive Plan 

On the Effective Date, pursuant to the Chapter 11 Plan, the Company adopted the Genco Shipping   Trading Limited 2014 Management Incentive Plan (the  MIP ). An aggregate of 9,668,061 shares of Common Stock were available for award under the MIP prior to the Company s reverse stock split, which is equivalent to approximately   

40 

Table of Contents  

966,806 shares on a post-split basis.  Awards under the MIP took the form of restricted stock grants and three tiers of MIP Warrants with staggered strike prices based on increasing equity values.  The number of shares of common stock available under the Plan represented approximately 1.8% of the shares of post-emergence Common Stock outstanding as of the Effective Date on a fully-diluted basis. Awards under the MIP were available to eligible employees, non-employee directors and/or officers of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Eligible Individuals ). Under the MIP, a committee appointed by the Board from time to time (or, in the absence of such a committee, the Board) (in either case, the  Plan Committee ) may grant a variety of stock-based incentive awards, as the Plan Committee deems appropriate, to Eligible Individuals. The MIP Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and contain customary anti-dilution protection in the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, dividend or other distributions (including, but not limited to, cash dividends), or business combination transaction.   

On August 7, 2014, pursuant to the MIP, certain individuals were granted MIP Warrants whereby each warrant can be converted on a cashless basis for the amount in excess of the respective strike price. The MIP Warrants were issued in three tranches for 2,380,664, 2,467,009 and 3,709,788 shares.  Following the Company s reverse stock split, these MIP warrants are exercisable for approximately 238,066, 246,701, and 370,979 shares and have exercise prices of $259.10 (the  $259.10 Warrants ), $287.30 (the  $287.30 Warrants ) and $341.90 (the  $341.90 Warrants ) per whole share, respectively. The fair value of each warrant upon emergence from bankruptcy was $7.22 for the $259.10 Warrants, $6.63 for the $287.30 Warrants and $5.63 for the $341.90 Warrants. The warrant values were based upon a calculation using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. This model uses inputs such as the underlying price of the shares issued when the warrant is exercised, volatility, cost of capital interest rate and expected life of the instrument. The Company has determined that the warrants should be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy by evaluating each input for the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula against the fair value hierarchy criteria and using the lowest level of input as the basis for the fair value classification. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula used a volatility of 43.91% (representing the six -year volatility of a peer group), a risk-free interest rate of 1.85% and a dividend rate of 0%.  The aggregate fair value of these awards upon emergence from bankruptcy was $54,436. The warrants vest 33.33% on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, with accelerated vesting upon a change in control of the Company. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized amortization expense of the fair value of these warrants, which is included in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of General, administrative and management fees, as follows: 

Amortization of the unamortized stock-based compensation balance of $5,132 as of September 30, 2016 is expected to be expensed $1,523 and $3,609 during the remainder of 2016 and during the year ending December 31, 2017, respectively.  The following table summarizes the warrant activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

2015 Equity Incentive Plan 

On June 26, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan for awards with respect to an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of common stock, or 400,000 shares following the Company s reverse stock split (the  2015 Plan ).  Under the 2015 Plan, the Company s Board of Directors, the compensation committee, or another designated committee of the Board of Directors may grant a variety of stock-based incentive awards to the Company s officers, directors, employees, and consultants.  Awards may consist of stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, restricted (nonvested) stock, restricted stock units, and unrestricted stock.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has awarded restricted stock units and restricted stock under the 2015 Plan.

Restricted Stock Units 

The Company has issued restricted stock units ( RSUs ) under the 2015 Plan to certain members of the Board of Directors, which represent the right to receive a share of common stock, or in the sole discretion of the Company s Compensation Committee, the value of a share of common stock on the date that the RSU vests.  The RSUs generally vest on the date of the Company s annual shareholders meeting following the date of the grant.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 3,138 and 0 shares, respectively, of the Company s common stock were outstanding in respect of the RSUs.  Such shares will only be issued in respect of vested RSUs when the director s service with the Company as a director terminates. 

The RSUs that have been issued to certain members of the Board of Directors generally vest on the date of the annual shareholders meeting of the Company following the date of the grant.   The table below summarizes the Company s RSUs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The total fair value of the RSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $30 and $116, respectively. The total fair value is calculated as the number of shares vested during the period multiplied by the fair value on the vesting date.    On February 17, 2016, the vesting of 23,286 outstanding RSUs, or 2,328 outstanding RSUs on a post-reverse stock split basis, were accelerated upon the resignation of two members on the Company s Board of Directors.

19 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

In April 2015, six class action complaints were filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York.  On May 26, 2015, the six actions were consolidated under the caption In Re Baltic Trading Ltd. Stockholder Litigation, Index No. 651241/2015, and a consolidated class action complaint was filed on June 10, 2015 (the  Consolidated Complaint ).  The Consolidated Complaint is purported to be brought by and on behalf of Baltic Trading s shareholders and alleges that the then-proposed July 2015 merger did not fairly compensate Baltic Trading s shareholders and undervalued Baltic Trading.  The Consolidated Complaint names as defendants the Company, Baltic Trading, the individual members of Baltic Trading s board, and the Company s merger subsidiary. The claims generally allege (i) breaches of fiduciary duties of good faith, due care, disclosure to shareholders, and loyalty, including for failing to maximize shareholder value, and (ii) aiding and abetting those breaches. Among other relief, the complaints seek an injunction against the merger, declaratory judgments that the individual defendants breached fiduciary duties, rescission of the merger agreement, and unspecified damages.   

On July 9, 2015, plaintiffs in that action moved to enjoin the merger vote, scheduled to take place on July 17, 2015.  The motion was thereafter fully briefed and argued on July 15, 2015.  The motion to enjoin the vote was denied on July 15, 2015 (the  Preliminary Injunction Denial ).  Plaintiffs sought an emergency injunction and temporary restraining order from the New York State Appellate Division, First Department the following day, on July 16, 2015.  The Appellate Division denied the request, and the vote, and subsequent merger, proceeded as scheduled on July 17, 2015.  Plaintiffs thereafter withdrew that appeal.  

On June 30, 2015, Defendants had moved to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint in its entirety.  Plaintiffs subsequently served an Amended Consolidated Complaint, and Defendants directed their motion to dismiss to that amended complaint.  The motion to dismiss was granted and the Amended Consolidated Complaint was dismissed with prejudice on August 29, 2016 (the  Dismissal Decision ).       

On September 29, 2016, plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, which recites their appeal of the Dismissal Decision,  including ... and as referenced in  the Dismissal Order, the Preliminary Injunction Denial.  

From time to time, the Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its business, principally personal injury and property casualty claims. Such claims, even if lacking merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.  The Company is not aware of any legal proceedings or claims that it believes will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material effect on the Company, its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows besides those noted above.

The following management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Form 10-Q. 

General 

We are a Marshall Islands company that transports iron ore, coal, grain, steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels.  Excluding the Genco Leader which was sold on November 4, 2016, our fleet currently consists of 66 drybulk vessels, including 13 Capesize, seven Panamax, four Ultramax, 21 Supramax, five Handymax and 16 Handysize drybulk carriers, with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately 4,979,000 dwt, and the average age of our fleet is currently approximately 9.5 years.  We seek to deploy our vessels on time charters, spot market-related time charters or in vessel pools trading in the spot market, to reputable charterers, including Cargill International S.A., Swissmarine Services S.A. and the Clipper Logger Pool and Clipper Sapphire Pool, in which Clipper Group acts as the pool manager.  The majority of the vessels in our current fleet are presently engaged under time charter, spot market-related time charter and vessel pool contracts that expire (assuming the option periods in the time charters are not exercised) between November 2016 and July 2017. 

See pages 58-60 for a table of all vessels in our fleet. 

On April 7, 2015, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Baltic Trading under which we agreed to acquire Baltic Trading in a stock-for-stock transaction (the  Merger ).  Under the terms of the agreement, Baltic Trading   

47 

Table of Contents  

became our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, and Baltic Trading shareholders (other than GS T and its subsidiaries) received 0.216 shares of our common stock for each share of Baltic Trading s common stock they owned at closing, with fractional shares that were settled in cash.  Upon consummation of the transaction on July 17, 2015, our shareholders owned approximately 84.5% of the combined company, and Baltic Trading s shareholders (other than the GS T and its subsidiaries) owned approximately 15.5% of the combined company.  Shares of Baltic Trading s Class B stock (all of which we owned) were canceled in the Merger.  Our stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange after consummation of the transaction on July 20, 2015 under the symbol  GNK.  

Our Board of Directors and Baltic Trading s Board of Directors established independent special committees to review the transaction and negotiate the terms on behalf of their respective companies.  Both independent special committees unanimously approved the transaction.  The Boards of Directors of both companies approved the merger by unanimous vote of directors present and voting, with Peter C. Georgiopoulos, former Chairman of the Board of each company, recused for the vote.  The Merger was approved on July 17, 2015 at the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 

Prior to the Merger, as of June 30, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary Genco Investments LLC owned 6,356,471 shares of Baltic Trading s Class B Stock, which represented a 10.85% ownership interest in Baltic Trading and 64.60% of the aggregate voting power of Baltic Trading s outstanding shares of voting stock at June 30, 2015. Baltic Trading is consolidated as we also controlled a majority of the voting interest in Baltic Trading prior to the Merger.  Management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition includes the results of Baltic Trading. 

We report financial information and evaluate our operations by charter revenues and not by the length of ship employment for our customers, i.e., spot or time charters.  Each of our vessels serve the same type of customer, have similar operations and maintenance requirements, operate in the same regulatory environment, and are subject to similar economic characteristics. Based on this, we have determined that we operate in one reportable segment, after the effective date of the Merger on July 17, 2015, in which we are engaged in the ocean transportation of drybulk cargoes worldwide through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels.  Therefore, the totals previously reported for the two segments (GS T and Baltic Trading) is the total for the single reportable segment effective upon the Merger. 

Additionally, on April 7, 2015, we entered into an agreement under which we acquired all of the shares of two single-purpose entities that were wholly owned by Baltic Trading, each of which owns one Capesize drybulk vessel, for an aggregate purchase price of $68.5 million, subject to reduction for $40.6 million of outstanding first-mortgage debt of such single-purpose entities that is to be guaranteed by the Company and an adjustment for the difference between such single-purpose entities  current assets and total liabilities as of the closing date.  Through the transactions, which closed on April 8, 2015, we acquired the vessels known as the Baltic Lion and the Baltic Tiger. The independent special committees of both companies  Boards of Directors reviewed and approved this transaction. 

On April 5, 2016, the Board of Directors unanimously approved scrapping the Genco Marine. On May 17, 2016, we completed the sale of the Genco Marine.  We realized a net loss of $0.1 million and had net proceeds of $1.9 million from the sale of the vessel, including costs incurred to deliver the vessel to the buyer, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  We reached an agreement on May 6, 2016 to sell the Genco Marine, a 1996-built Handymax vessel, to be scrapped with Ace Exim Pte Ltd., a demolition yard, for a net amount $2.2 million less a 2.0% broker commission payable to a third party.    

During October 2016, we reached agreements with third-parties to sell three of our vessels, the Genco Pioneer (a 1999-built Handysize vessel), the Genco Sugar (a 1998-built Handysize vessel) and the Genco Leader (a 1999-built Panamax vessel).   These sales were completed during October and November 2016.  Refer to Note 20   Subsequent Events in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. 

We entered into a long-term management agreement (the  Management Agreement ) with Baltic Trading pursuant to which we applied our expertise and experience in the drybulk industry to provide Baltic Trading with commercial, technical, administrative and strategic services. The Management Agreement was for an initial term of approximately 15 years. Baltic Trading paid us for the services we provided it as well as reimbursed us for our costs and expenses incurred in providing certain of these services. Management fee income we earned from the Management

Agreement net of any allocated shared expenses, such as salary, office expenses and other general and administrative fees, were taxable to us. Upon consolidation with Baltic Trading, any management fee income earned was eliminated for financial reporting purposes.  The Management Agreement was terminated as of July 18, 2015. 

Our management team and our other employees are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet. Commercial management includes the negotiation of charters for vessels, managing the mix of various types of charters, such as time charters, voyage charters and spot market-related time charters, and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters. Strategic management includes locating, purchasing, financing and selling vessels. We currently contract with three independent technical managers to provide technical management of our fleet at a lower cost than we believe would be possible in-house. Technical management involves the day-to-day management of vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies. Members of our New York City-based management team oversee the activities of our independent technical managers. 

On October 13, 2016, Peter C. Georgiopoulos resigned as our Chairman of the Board and a director of the Company.  The Board of Directors appointed Arthur L. Regan, a current director of the Company, as Interim Executive Chairman of the Board.  In connection with his departure, Mr. Georgiopoulos entered into a Separation Agreement and a Release Agreement with the Company on October 13, 2016.  Under the terms of these agreements, subject to customary conditions, Mr. Georgiopoulos is to receive an amount equal to the annual Chairman s fee awarded to him in recent years of $0.5 million as a severance payment and full vesting of his unvested equity awards, which consist of grants of 68,581 restricted shares of the Company s common stock and warrants exercisable for approximately 213,937 shares of the Company s common stock with an exercise per share ranging $259.10 to $341.90.  Refer to Note 18   Stock-Based Compensation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The agreements also contain customary provisions pertaining to confidential information, releases of claims by Mr. Georgiopoulos, and other restrictive covenants. 

We hold an investment in the capital stock of Jinhui Shipping and Transportation Limited ( Jinhui ) and Korea Line Corporation ( KLC ). Jinhui is a drybulk shipping owner and operator focused on the Supramax segment of drybulk shipping. KLC is a marine transportation service company which operates a fleet of carriers which includes carriers for iron ore, liquefied natural gas and tankers for oil and petroleum products. 

We formerly provided technical services for drybulk vessels purchased by MEP under an agency agreement between us and MEP.  These services included oversight of crew management, insurance, drydocking, ship operations and financial statement preparation, but did not include chartering services.  The services were initially provided for a fee of $750 per ship per day plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs and will be provided for an initial term of one year.  Mr. Georgiopoulos is a director of and has a minority interest in MEP.  This arrangement was approved by an independent committee of our Board of Directors.  On September 30, 2015, under the oversight of an independent committee of our Board of Directors, Genco Management (USA) LLC and MEP entered into certain agreements under which MEP paid $2.2 million of the amount of service fees in arrears (of which $0.3 million was paid in 2016 by the new owners of five of the MEP vessels sold in January 2016 as described below) and the daily service fee was reduced from $750 to $650 per day effective on October 1, 2015.  During January 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2016, five and seven of MEP s vessels, respectively, were sold to third parties, upon which these vessels were no longer subject to the agency agreement.  Based upon the September 30, 2015 agreement, termination fees were due in the amount $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, which was assumed by the new owners of the MEP vessels that were sold.  The amount of these termination fees has been paid in full.  The daily service fee earned for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 has also been paid in full.  At September 30, 2016, all MEP vessels have been sold.

Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 

We believe that the following table reflects important measures for analyzing trends in our results of operations. The table reflects our ownership days, available days, operating days, fleet utilization, TCE rates and daily vessel operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 on a consolidated basis, which includes the operations of Baltic Trading.  On July 7, 2016, the Company completed a one-for-ten reverse stock split of

Definitions 

In order to understand our discussion of our results of operations, it is important to understand the meaning of the following terms used in our analysis and the factors that influence our results of operations. 

(1) Ownership days  .  We define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period. 

(2) Available days  .  We define available days as the number of our ownership days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels between time charters. Companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. 

(3) Operating days  .  We define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues. 

(4) Fleet utilization  .  We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company s efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the number of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys or vessel positioning. 

(5) TCE rates  .  We define TCE rates as net voyage revenue (voyage revenues less voyage expenses) divided by the number of our available days during the period, which is consistent with industry standards. TCE rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per-day amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts. 

(6) Daily vessel operating expenses  .  We define daily vessel operating expenses as vessel operating expenses divided by ownership days for the period.  Vessel operating expenses include crew wages and related costs, the cost of insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance (excluding drydocking), the costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses.

EBITDA represents net (loss) income attributable to Genco Shipping   Trading Limited plus net interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization.  EBITDA is included because it is used by management and certain investors as a measure of operating performance. EBITDA is used by analysts in the shipping industry as a common performance measure to compare results across peers.  Our management uses EBITDA as a performance measure in our consolidated internal financial statements, and it is presented for review at our board meetings.  We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors as the shipping industry is capital intensive which often results in significant depreciation and cost of financing.  EBITDA presents investors with a measure in addition to net income to evaluate

our performance prior to these costs.  EBITDA is not an item recognized by U.S. GAAP (i.e. non-GAAP measure) and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other indicator of a company s operating performance required by U.S. GAAP.  EBITDA is not a measure of liquidity or cash flows as shown in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The definition of EBITDA used here may not be comparable to that used by other companies.  Pursuant to the amendments entered into on April 30, 2015 for our $100 Million Term Loan Facility and our $253 Million Term Loan Facility, the definition of Consolidated EBITDA used in the financial covenants has been eliminated. The following table demonstrates our calculation of EBITDA and provides a reconciliation of EBITDA to net (loss) income attributable to Genco Shipping   Trading Limited for each of the periods presented above:

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 

VOYAGE REVENUES- 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, voyage revenues decreased by $11.3 million, or 23.0%, to $37.9 million as compared to $49.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in voyage revenues was primarily due to lower spot market rates achieved by the majority of our vessels. 

The average Time Charter Equivalent ( TCE ) rate of our fleet decreased 17.5% to $5,779 a day for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $7,009 a day for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in TCE rates was primarily due to lower spot rates achieved by the majority of the vessels in our fleet during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period last year.    During the third quarter of 2016, the Baltic Dry Index continued to increase from all-time lows registered earlier in the year. Freight rates during the quarter were primarily supported by heightened demand for iron ore cargoes due to augmented Chinese steel production and increased coal shipments to China as the country reduced domestic coal output. With regard to supply, net fleet growth in the year-to-date remained relatively low in historical terms, however vessel demolition activity eased significantly during the third quarter as compared to the first half of the year leading to a rising pace of fleet growth during the period. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had 6,348.0 and 6,311.9 ownership days, respectively. The increase in ownership days is a result of the delivery of the Baltic Scorpion and Baltic Mantis during the second half of 2015 partially offset by the scrapping of the Genco Marine on May 17, 2016.  Fleet utilization increased to 99.4% from 98.9% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to additional offhire periods during the three months ended September 30, 2015 for some of our Capesize and Handymax vessels. 

SERVICE REVENUES- 

Service revenues consist of revenues earned from providing technical services to MEP pursuant to the agency agreement between us and MEP.  These services include oversight of crew management, insurance, drydocking, ship operations and financial statement preparation, but do not include chartering services.  The services were provided for a fee of $750 per ship per day until October 1, 2015, when the daily fees were reduced to $650 per ship per day pursuant to an agreement entered into between Genco Management (USA) LLC and MEP.  During the three months ended   

60 

Table of Contents  

September 30, 2016 and 2015, total service revenue was $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively.  The increase was primarily a result of the termination fees associated with the sale of the remaining seven MEP vessels during the third quarter of 2016 to third parties in the amount of $0.8 million.  This increase was partially offset by a decrease in daily management fees of $0.6 million primarily as a result of the aforementioned sale of seven vessels during the third quarter of 2016, as well as the sale of five MEP vessel during January 2016.   

VOYAGE EXPENSES- 

In time charters, spot market-related time charters and pool agreements, operating costs including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel and specified voyage costs such as fuel and port charges are paid by the charterer. There are certain other non-specified voyage expenses such as commissions which are typically borne by us. Voyage expenses include port and canal charges, fuel (bunker) expenses and brokerage commissions payable to unaffiliated third parties. Port and canal charges and bunker expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on voyage charters because these expenses are for the account of the vessel owner. At the inception of a time charter, we record the difference between the cost of bunker fuel delivered by the terminating charterer and the bunker fuel sold to the new charterer as a gain or loss within voyage expenses and the cost of bunkers consumed during short-term time charters pursuant to the terms of the time charter agreement. 

Voyage expenses decreased by $4.4 million from $6.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to $2.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The decrease was primarily due to a $2.1 million decrease in net bunker losses recorded during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015 based on the difference between the cost of bunker fuel delivered by the terminating charterer and the bunker fuel sold to the new charterer as a result of the increase in bunker prices.  Additionally, there was a $1.3 million decrease in cost of bunkers consumed during short-term time charters during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period last year.  Lastly, there was a $0.6 million decrease in the write down of our bunker inventory at the end of each quarter to its market value resulting from the fact that there was more bunker inventory that was above the market value and need to be adjusted as of September 30, 2015 as compared to September 30, 2016.   

VESSEL OPERATING EXPENSES- 

Vessel operating expenses decreased by $3.1 million from $31.5 million during the third quarter of 2015 to $28.5 million during the third quarter of 2016.  This decrease was primarily due to lower expenses related to maintenance, crewing and insurance as well as the timing of purchases of stores and spares. 

Daily vessel operating expenses decreased to $4,483 per vessel per day for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $4,997 per day for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in daily vessel operating expenses was predominantly due to lower expenses related to maintenance, crewing and insurance, as well as the timing of purchases of stores and spares.  We believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a 12-month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation.  Our actual daily vessel operating expenses per vessel for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $337 below the weighted-average budgeted rate of $4,820 per vessel per day. 

Our vessel operating expenses, which generally represent fixed costs for each vessel, increase to the extent our fleet expands. Other factors beyond our control, some of which may affect the shipping industry in general, including, for instance, developments relating to market prices for crewing, lubes, and insurance, may also cause these expenses to increase. 

GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND MANAGEMENT FEES- 

We incur general and administrative expenses, which relate to our onshore non-vessel-related activities. Our general and administrative expenses include our payroll expenses, including those relating to our executive officers, rent, legal, auditing and other professional expenses.  For further information on the restricted shares issued as incentive compensation to our former Chairman, our employees and our directors under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2014 Management Incentive Program (the  MIP ), refer to Note 18   Stock-Based Compensation in our Condensed   

61 

Table of Contents  

Consolidated Financial Statements.  Additionally, we incur management fees to third-party technical management companies for the day-to-day management of our vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, general, administrative and management fees were $10.2 million and $27.0 million, respectively.  The $16.8 million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in compensation costs and expenses related to the merger with Baltic Trading that were incurred during the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by costs related to financing or refinancing activities.  Included in general, administrative and management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are non-cash compensation expenses of $3.6 million and $11.8 million, respectively, arising from awards issued under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and the MIP. 

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION- 

We depreciate the cost of our vessels on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel. Depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value. We estimate the useful life of our vessels to be 25 years and we estimate the residual value by taking the estimated scrap value of $310 per lightweight ton times the weight of the ship in lightweight tons. 

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.0 million to $18.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $20.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense for the nine vessels which were deemed impaired at June 30, 2016 and written down to their net realizable value at June 30, 2016.  Additionally, there was a decrease in depreciation expense for the Genco Marine which was scrapped on May 17, 2016.  These decreases were slightly offset by an increase in depreciation expense for the Baltic Mantis, which delivered to the Company during the fourth quarter of 2016.  

OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME- 

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded an impairment of investment of $0 million and $32.5 million, respectively.  We review our investment in Jinhui for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.  Based on our review, we have deemed the investment in Jinhui to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2015. Our investment in Jinhui was not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2016.  Refer to Note 5   Investments in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.   

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)      

Other income (expense) fluctuated by $0.8 million from ($0.7) million during three months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  This fluctuation is primarily due to the change in gains and losses recorded related to the sale of available-for-sale investments.  Refer to Note 5   Investments and Note 9   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.   

NET INTEREST EXPENSE     

Net interest expense increased by $2.1 million from $4.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $7.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Net interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of interest expense under our credit facilities and amortization of deferred financing costs for those facilities. The increase in net interest expense for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees associated with the $98 Million Credit Facility which was entered into on November 4, 2015.

REORGANIZATION ITEMS, NET   

Reorganization items, net decreased by $0.1 million from $0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  These reorganization items include trustee fees and professional fees incurred after the Effective Date in relation to the Chapter 11 Cases.  The decrease is due to the winding down of settlement payments as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.  Refer to Note 16   Reorganization items, net in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. 

INCOME TAX EXPENSE- 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, income tax expense was $0.4 million as compared to $0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This income tax expense consists primarily of federal, state and local income taxes on net income earned by Genco Management (USA) LLC ( Genco (USA) ), one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Pursuant to certain agreements, we technically and commercially managed vessels for Baltic Trading until the Merger on July 17, 2015, as well as provide technical management of vessels for MEP in exchange for specified fees for these services provided.  These services are provided by Genco (USA), which has elected to be taxed as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes.  As such, Genco (USA) is subject to United States federal income tax on its worldwide net income, including the net income derived from providing these services.  Refer to the  Income taxes  section of Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.   

The increase in income tax expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period during the prior year is primarily due to an increase in service revenue recorded by Genco (USA) which was earned from MEP.  The increase in service revenue earned from MEP resulted primarily due to the $0.8 million of termination fees received for the sale of MEP s remaining seven vessels during the third quarter of 2016.  This increase was partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in management fees resulting from the sale of MEP s 12 vessels during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and reduction of the daily service fee received from $750 per vessel to $650 per vessel effective October 1, 2015.  Refer to Note 1   General Information included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  The increase in service revenue earned from GMU was partially offset by a decrease in income earned by Genco (USA) due to the cancellation of the Management Agreement with Baltic Trading effective July 18, 2015 pursuant to the Merger. 

NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST- 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $0 and $7.2 million, respectively.  Net loss (income) was allocated to the noncontrolling interest up until July 17, 2015 when the Merger was effective.  Once the Merger was effective, the noncontrolling interest allocation was no longer applicable. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 

VOYAGE REVENUES- 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, voyage revenues decreased by $27.1 million, or 23.2%, to $89.5 million as compared to $116.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in voyage revenues was primarily due to lower spot market rates achieved by the majority of our vessels. 

The average Time Charter Equivalent ( TCE ) rate of our fleet decreased 23.8% to $4,341 a day for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5,696 a day for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in TCE rates was primarily due to lower spot rates achieved by our vessels during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period last year.   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had 19,043.7 and 18,618.9 ownership days, respectively. The increase in ownership days is a result of the delivery of the Baltic Scorpion and Baltic Mantis during

the second half of 2015 partially offset by the scrapping of the Genco Marine on May 17, 2016.  Fleet utilization increased marginally to 99.0% from 98.7% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

SERVICE REVENUES- 

Service revenues consist of revenues earned from providing technical services to MEP pursuant to the agency agreement between us and MEP.  These services include oversight of crew management, insurance, drydocking, ship operations and financial statement preparation, but do not include chartering services.  The services were provided for a fee of $750 per ship per day until October 1, 2015, when the daily fees were reduced to $650 per ship per day pursuant to an agreement entered into between Genco Management (USA) LLC and MEP.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, total service revenue was $2.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively.   The decrease was primarily a result of a $1.3 million decrease in management fees due to the combination of the sale of five and seven of the MEP vessels during January 2016 and the third quarter of 2016, respectively, as well as the decrease in daily management fees.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the termination fees of $1.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the sale of the aforementioned 12 MEP vessels.   

VOYAGE EXPENSES- 

Voyage expenses decreased by $5.5 million from $14.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to $9.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The decrease was primarily due to a $1.7 million decrease in the write down of our bunker inventory at the end of each quarter to its market value resulting from the fact that there was more bunker inventory that was above the market value and need to be adjusted at quarter-end during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the same period during 2016.  Additionally, there was a decrease in bunker consumption of $1.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period during 2015, as well as a $1.1 million decrease in net bunker losses recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 based on the difference between the cost of bunker fuel delivered by the terminating charterer and the bunker fuel sold to the new charterer as a result of the increase in bunker prices.  Lastly, there was a $1.0 million decrease in the cost of bunkers consumed during short-term time charters during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period last year.   

VESSEL OPERATING EXPENSES- 

Vessel operating expenses decreased by $4.0 million from $90.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $86.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  This decrease was primarily due to lower expenses related to maintenance, as well as crewing and insurance expenses.  

Daily vessel operating expenses decreased to $4,523 per vessel per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $4,841 per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in daily vessel operating expenses was predominantly due to lower insurance, crew and maintenance related expenses.  We believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a 12-month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation.  Our actual daily vessel operating expenses per vessel for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $297 below the weighted-average budgeted rate of $4,820 per vessel per day. 

GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND MANAGEMENT FEES- 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, general, administrative and management fees were $36.9 million and $73.8 million, respectively.  The $36.9 million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in compensation costs and expenses related to the merger with Baltic Trading that were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by costs related to financing or refinancing activities.  Included in general, administrative and management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are non-cash compensation expenses of $14.5 million and $36.7 million, respectively, arising from awards issued under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and the MIP.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION- 

We depreciate the cost of our vessels on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel. Depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value. We estimate the useful life of our vessels to be 25 years and we estimate the residual value by taking the estimated scrap value of $310 per lightweight ton times the weight of the ship in lightweight tons. 

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $0.7 million to $58.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $58.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease was primarily due a decrease in depreciation expense for the nine vessels which were deemed impaired at June 30, 2016 and written down to their net realizable value at June 30, 2016.  Additionally, there was a decrease in depreciation for the Genco Marine which was scrapped on May 17, 2016.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense for the Baltic Scorpion and Baltic Mantis, which delivered to the Company during the third and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. 

OTHER OPERATING INCOME   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, other operating income was $0.2 million and $0, respectively.  The increase is primarily due to a payment of $0.2 million received from Samsun Logix Corporation as part of the cash settlement of the revised rehabilitation plan approved by the South Korean courts on April 8, 2016.  Refer to Note 17   Commitments and Contingencies in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the settlement. 

IMPAIRMENT OF VESSEL ASSETS - 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $69.3 million and $35.4 million, respectively, of impairment of vessel assets.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $67.6 million of impairment for nine of our vessels, the Genco Acheron, Genco Carrier, Genco Leader, Genco Pioneer, Genco Prosperity, Genco Reliance, Genco Success, Genco Sugar, and Genco Wisdom, for which we have deemed it is more likely than not that will be scrapped.  Additionally, we recorded $1.7 million of impairment of vessel assets to adjust the net realizable value of the Genco Marine which was scrapped on May 17, 2016.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded $35.4 million of impairment for the Baltic Lion and Baltic Tiger, which were sold to us from Baltic Trading on April 8, 2015.  Refer to Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information which describes how it was determined that these vessel assets were impaired.   

LOSS ON SALE OF VESSELS   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $0.1 million and $1.2 million Loss on sale of vessels, respectively.  On May 17, 2016, we scrapped the Genco Marine which resulted in a loss of $0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  On April 8, 2015, Baltic Trading sold two of its vessels, the Baltic Lion and Baltic Tiger, to us at a loss of $1.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME- 

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded an impairment of investment of $2.7 million and $32.5 million, respectively.  We review our investment in Jinhui for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.  Based on our review, we have deemed the investment in Jinhui to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Our investment in Jinhui was not deemed to be other-

than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2016.  Refer to Note 5   Investments in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.   

OTHER EXPENSE      

Other expense decreased by $0.6 million from $0.7 million during nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  This fluctuation is primarily due to a decrease in the losses recorded related to the sale of available-for-sale investments.  Refer to Note 5   Investments and Note 9   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.   

NET INTEREST EXPENSE     

Net interest expense increased by $7.3 million from $13.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $21.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Net interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of interest expense under our credit facilities and amortization of deferred financing costs for those facilities. The increase in net interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period during 2015 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees associated with the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility and the $98 Million Credit Facility which were entered into on April 7, 2015 and November 4, 2015, respectively. 

REORGANIZATION ITEMS, NET 

Reorganization items, net decreased by $0.8 million from $1.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  These reorganization items include trustee fees and professional fees incurred after the Effective Date in relation to the Chapter 11 Cases.  The decrease is due to the winding down of settlement payments as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.  Refer to Note 16   Reorganization items, net in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. 

INCOME TAX EXPENSE- 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income tax expense was $0.8 million as compared to $1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This income tax expense consists primarily of federal, state and local income taxes on net income earned by Genco Management (USA) LLC ( Genco (USA) ), one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Pursuant to certain agreements, we technically and commercially managed vessels for Baltic Trading until the Merger on July 17, 2015, as well as provide technical management of vessels for MEP in exchange for specified fees for these services provided.  These services are provided by Genco (USA), which has elected to be taxed as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes.  As such, Genco (USA) is subject to United States federal income tax on its worldwide net income, including the net income derived from providing these services.  Refer to the  Income taxes  section of Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.   

The decrease in income tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period during the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in income earned by Genco (USA) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the cancellation of the Management Agreement with Baltic Trading effective July 18, 2015 pursuant to the Merger.  As a result of the cancellation, Genco (USA) was no longer earning commercial service revenue, management fees and sales and purchase fee from Baltic Trading effective July 18, 2015.  Refer to Note 1   General Information included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST- 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $0 and $59.5 million, respectively.  Net loss (income) was allocated to the noncontrolling interest up until July 17, 2015

when the Merger was effective.  Once the Merger was effective, the noncontrolling interest allocation was no longer applicable. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our principal sources of funds are currently operating cash flows and long-term bank borrowings.  We have also historically used issuances of equity and long-term debt securities as sources of financing and may do so in the future.  Our principal use of funds is capital expenditures to establish and grow our fleet, maintain the quality of our vessels, comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations, and fund working capital requirements and repayments on outstanding loan facilities.  However, if market conditions continue to deteriorate, we may be unable to raise additional equity capital or debt financing on acceptable terms or at all. 

Our liquidity needs arise primarily from drydocking for our vessels and working capital requirements as may be needed to support our business and payments required under our indebtedness. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations, cash on hand, and credit facility borrowings. Our ability to continue to meet our liquidity needs is subject to and will be affected by cash utilized in operations, the economic or business environment in which we operate, weakness in shipping industry conditions, the financial condition of our customers, vendors and service providers, our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants of our indebtedness, and other factors. 

Persistent, historically low rates in the drybulk shipping market have led to decreases in our overall revenues and operating losses on some of the charters we enter into.  As a result, we have experienced negative cash flows, and in turn, our liquidity has been negatively impacted.  If the current market environment persists, declines further, or does not recover sufficiently, we may have insufficient liquidity to fund ongoing operations or satisfy our obligations under our credit facilities, which may lead to a default under one or more of our credit facilities. 

We entered into the Commitment Letter, the subsequent Amended Commitment Letter and the Second Amended Commitment Letter on June 8, 2016, June 30, 2016 and October 6, 2016.  This Commitment Letter for a senior secured loan facility (the  New Facility ) for an aggregate principal amount of up to $400 million is intended to refinance our $100 Million Term Loan Facility, $253 Million Term Loan Facility, $148 Million Credit Facility, $22 Million Term Loan Facility, $44 Million Term Loan Facility and 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, as defined in Note 8   Debt in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The New Facility is subject to definitive documentation, and our ability to borrow under the New Facility is subject to a number of conditions, including completion of an equity financing satisfactory to the lenders with gross proceeds to us including the equity commitments as described in Note 8   Debt in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of at least $125 million, amendment of our other credit facilities on terms satisfactory to the lenders and other customary conditions.  On June 30, 2016 we entered into an amendment and restatement of the Commitment Letter (the  Amended Commitment Letter ) which established or extended waivers of certain credit facility covenants described below through 11:59 p.m. on September 30, 2016 on certain conditions, including a condition that we enter into a definitive purchase agreement or file a registration statement for an equity financing by 11:59 p.m. on August 15, 2016.  Lastly, on October 6, 2016, we entered into a second amendment and restatement of the Commitment Letter (the  Second Amended Commitment Letter ) which further extended the waivers of certain credit facility covenants described below through November 15, 2016.   

As a condition to the effectiveness of the Second Amended Commitment Letter, we entered into stock purchase agreements effective as of October 4, 2016 (the  Initial Purchase Agreements ) with funds or related entities managed by Centerbridge, SVP and Apollo (the  Investors ) for an aggregate of up to $125 million in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The Investors made a firm commitment to purchase shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series A Preferred Stock ) for an aggregate of $86.4 million and a backstop commitment to purchase additional shares of common stock for up to $38.6 million, in each case at a purchase price of $4.85 per share. The Series A Preferred Stock will be automatically and mandatorily convertible into our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, upon approval by our shareholders of such conversion.  An additional 1,288,660 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be issued to the Investors as a commitment fee on a pro rata basis.   Subsequently, on October 27, 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the  Additional Purchase Agreement ) with certain of the Investors; John C. Wobensmith, our President; and other investors for the sale of shares of Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $38.6 million at a purchase price of $4.85 per share.  The

purchase price and the other terms and conditions of these transactions were established in arm s length negotiations between an independent special committee of our board of directors (the  Special Committee ) and the investors.  The Special Committee unanimously approved the transactions. Refer to Note 8   Debt in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.   

Given the negative impact of the current drybulk rate environment, we also face covenant compliance issues.  Our credit facilities contain minimum cash covenants measured on a company-wide basis and on the basis of the number of vessels pledged by obligors under each credit facility.  Pursuant to the Second Amended Commitment Letter and the Amended $98 Million Credit Facility Commitment Letter (as discussed in Note 8   Debt in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), our company-wide minimum cash covenant has been waived through November 15, 2016 so long as we maintain a minimum cash balance of $25.0 million. Additionally, the collateral maintenance waivers and maximum leverage ratio waivers under the 2014 Term Loan Facility were extended through November 15, 2016 pursuant to a waiver entered into on October 14, 2016.Moreover, under the Second Amended Commitment Letter, from September 30 through November 15, 2016, the amount of cash we would need to maintain under our minimum cash covenants applicable only to obligors in each facility to be refinanced under the Amended Commitment Letter would be reduced by up to $0.25 million per vessel, subject to an overall maximum cash withdrawal of $10.0 million to pay expenses and additional conditions. However, in light of our requirements to fund ongoing operations, make payments under our credit facilities, and the possibility of utilizing cash to resolve collateral maintenance shortfalls after the waiver period ends on November 15, 2016, we believe that without taking measures described below that may not be available to us, including entering into the New Facility, it is probable that we will not remain in compliance with our minimum cash covenants under our credit facilities after September 30, 2016. 

As a result of the current weakness in vessel values, we did not meet the maximum leverage or leverage ratio covenants in our credit facilities as of September 30, 2016.  These covenants require us to maintain a ratio not to exceed 70% of financial indebtedness divided by value adjusted total assets, each as defined therein.  Pursuant to the Second Amended Commitment Letter, the Amended $98 Million Credit Facility Commitment Letter and waivers received for the 2014 Term Loan Facilities (as discussed in Note 8   Debt in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), the maximum leverage ratio covenants have been waived through November 15, 2016 for all of our credit facilities.  The waiver under the 2014 Term Loan Facilities will be void if Sinosure gives written notice to the agent bank that it does not approve the waivers. However, given the current weakness in vessel values, it is probable that we will not remain in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio covenants under our credit facilities after November 15, 2016. 

Lastly, pursuant to the Second Amended Commitment Letter and the waiver entered into on October 14, 2016 for the 2014 Term Loan Facilities, the collateral maintenance covenants have been waived through November 15, 2016.  Additionally, pursuant to the Amended $98 Million Credit Facility Commitment Letter entered into on September 30, 2016, extended the reduction of the collateral maintenance covenant from 140% to 120% through November 15, 2016.  Refer to Note 8   Debt in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these waivers.    Under the collateral maintenance covenants, as amended, of our $98 Million Credit Facility, 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, $253 Million Term Loan Facility, $100 Million Term Loan Facility, $148 Million Credit Facility, $22 Million Term Loan Facility, $44 Million Term Loan Facility and the 2014 Term Loan Facilities, the aggregate valuations of our vessels pledged under each facility must at least be a certain percentage of loans outstanding, which percentages currently are 120%, 140%, 135%, 130%, 140%, 110%, 125% and 135%, respectively, as of September 30, 2016. Absent the aforementioned waivers, if this test is not met, we may be required to take certain actions to remedy the shortfall.  See  Critical Accounting Policies   Vessels and Depreciation  below for further details of our vessel valuations.  Given the current weakness in vessel values, we believe it is probable that we will not meet the minimum threshold under the collateral maintenance covenant in certain of our credit facilities after November 15, 2016 when the aforementioned waivers expire if we have not entered into the New Facility. 

In light of the foregoing, we will likely require capital to fund ongoing operations and debt service and to maintain compliance with our credit facility covenants.  The transactions contemplated by the Second Amended Commitment Letter and the Amended $98 Million Credit Facility Commitment Letter are intended to address our liquidity and covenant compliance issues.  Such transactions are subject to a number of conditions, including completion of an equity financing satisfactory to the lenders with gross proceeds to us of at least $125 million, which are intended to be fulfilled by the Initial Purchase Agreements and the Additional Purchase Agreement.  If we are unable to fulfill these   

68 

Table of Contents  

conditions, we will need to consider alternatives to address our liquidity and covenant compliance issues.  For example, we may seek to refinance our indebtedness, obtain further waivers or modifications to our credit agreements from our lenders (which may be unavailable or subject to conditions) or raise additional capital through selling assets (including vessels), reducing or delaying capital expenditures, or pursuing other options that may be available to us which may include pursuing strategic opportunities and equity or debt offerings or potentially seeking protection in a Chapter 11 proceeding.  To the extent such actions include dispositions of vessels, our ability to do so on acceptable terms may be limited by depressed vessel values, a second-hand market for the sale of vessels that has become less active, and ongoing limited availability of financing for buyers of vessels.  In addition, to remedy or mitigate our non-compliance under our collateral maintenance covenants, we may prepay a portion of our indebtedness or pledge one or more of our remaining unencumbered vessels.  We cannot be certain that we will accomplish any of the actions described above. 

Absent any of the foregoing actions, if we do not comply with our covenants under our credit facilities and fail to cure our non-compliance following applicable notice and expiration of applicable cure periods, we will be in default of one or more of our credit facilities.  As a result and given the presence of cross defaults amongst the credit agreements, some or all of our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable, and we may not have sufficient assets available to satisfy our obligations.  Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral to our lenders, and our lenders may seek to foreclose on their collateral if a default occurs.  We may have to seek alternative sources of financing on terms that may not be favorable to us or that may not be available at all.  We therefore could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. 

Historically, we have used funds to pay dividends and to repurchase our common stock from time to time. We have not declared or paid any dividends since the third quarter of 2008 and currently do not plan to resume the payment of dividends.  Moreover, pursuant to restrictions under our credit facilities, we are currently prohibited from paying dividends.  Future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our cash flows, cash requirements, financial condition, results of operations, required capital expenditures or reserves, contractual restrictions (including debt covenants), provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. 

Prior to the merger with Baltic Trading, Genco Investments LLC owned 6,356,471 shares of Baltic Trading s Class B Stock, which represents a 10.85% ownership interest in Baltic Trading and 64.60% of the aggregate voting power of Baltic Trading s outstanding shares of voting stock.  On April 7, 2015, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Baltic Trading under which we acquired Baltic Trading in a stock-for-stock transaction.  The Merger was approved on July 17, 2015.  Under the terms of the agreement, Baltic Trading became our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, and Baltic Trading shareholders (other than GS T and its subsidiaries) received 0.216 shares of our common stock for each share of Baltic Trading s common stock they owned at closing, with fractional shares to be settled in cash.  Upon consummation of the transaction on July 17, 2015, our shareholders owned approximately 84.5% of the combined company, and Baltic Trading s shareholders (other than the GS T and its subsidiaries) owned approximately 15.5% of the combined company.  Shares of Baltic Trading s Class B stock (all of which are owned by us) were canceled in the Merger.  Our stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange after consummation of the transaction on July 20, 2015 under the symbol  GNK.  

Our Board of Directors and Baltic Trading s Board of Directors established independent special committees to review the transaction and negotiate the terms on behalf of their respective companies.  Both independent special committees unanimously approved the transaction.  The Boards of Directors of both companies approved the merger by unanimous vote of directors present and voting, with Peter C. Georgiopoulos, former Chairman of the Board of each company, recused for the vote. The Merger was approved on July 17, 2015 at the Annual Meeting. 

Dividends 

We are currently prohibited from paying dividends under certain of our facilities, the longest restriction of which is in effect until May 1, 2017. Following May 1, 2017, the amount of dividends we may pay is limited based on the amount of the loans outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility and the $98 Million Credit Facility, as well as the ratio of the value of vessels and certain other collateral pledged under the $98 Million Credit Facility to the amount of the loan outstanding under such facility. In addition, dividends may not exceed 50% of our net income (as defined in the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility) and may only be paid out of excess cash flow of Genco and its   

69 

Table of Contents  

subsidiaries (as defined in the $98 Million Credit Facility). Moreover, we would make dividend payments to our shareholders only if our Board of Directors, acting in its sole discretion, determines that such payments would be in our best interest and in compliance with relevant legal and contractual requirements. The principal business factors that our Board of Directors would consider when determining the timing and amount of dividend payments would be our earnings, financial condition and cash requirements at the time. Marshall Islands law generally prohibits the declaration and payment of dividends other than from surplus. Marshall Islands law also prohibits the declaration and payment of dividends while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend. 

Cash Flow 

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $45.9 million and $39.4 million, respectively.  Included in the net loss attributable to Genco during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are $72.0 million and $67.9 million of non-cash impairment charges, respectively. Also included in the net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $14.5 million and $36.7 million, respectively, of non-cash amortization of non-vested stock compensation due to the vesting of restricted shares and warrants primarily issued under the MIP. Additionally, the fluctuation in accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by $13.7 million due to the timing of payments.  The above changes in operating activities were partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in the fluctuation in prepaid expenses and other current assets.  Additionally, there was an $8.3 million decrease in deferred drydocking costs incurred because there were fewer vessels that completed drydocking during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period during 2015.  

Net cash provided by investing activities was $5.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $26.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The fluctuation is primarily due to a $45.7 million decrease in the purchase of vessels, including deposits.  The decrease is primarily due to the completion of the purchase of the Baltic Wasp on January 2, 2015 and the Baltic Scorpion on August 6, 2015.  Additionally, there was an increase of $3.2 million of proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale ( AFS ) securities, as well as $1.9 million of proceeds from the sale of the Genco Marine which was scrapped during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  These fluctuations were partially offset by a $19.6 million decrease in deposits of restricted cash, representing the amount of restricted cash that was held in an escrow account as of December 31, 2014 for the purchase of the Baltic Wasp, which was released to the shipyard upon the vessel delivery on January 2, 2015. 

Net cash used in financing activities was $40.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $26.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of the following: $15.2 million repayment of debt under the $253 Million Term Loan Facility, $9.0 million repayment of debt under the $148 Million Credit Facility, $5.8 million repayment of debt under the $100 Million Term Loan Facility, $4.9 million repayment of debt under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, $2.1 million repayment of debt under $44 Million Term Loan Facility, $2.1 million repayment of debt under the 2014 Term Loan Facilities, $1.1 million repayment of debt under the $22 Million Term Loan Facility, and $0.1 million cash settlement paid to non-accredited 5.00% Convertible Senior Note holders. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted primarily of $131.5 million of proceeds from the $148 Million Credit Facility and $35.0 million of proceeds from 2015 Revolving Credit Facility partially offset by the following: $102.3 million repayment of debt under the 2010 Credit Facility, $16.9 million repayment of debt under the $253 Million Term Loan Facility, $5.8 million repayment of debt under the $100 Million Term Loan Facility, $4.9 million repayment of debt under the $148 Million Term Loan Facility, $2.1 million repayment of debt under the $44 Million Term Loan Facility, $1.1 million repayment of debt under the $22 Million Term Loan Facility, $1.4 million repayment of debt under the 2014 Term Loan Facilities, $0.7 million cash settlement paid to non-accredited 5.00% Convertible Senior Note holders, and $4.5 million payment of deferred financing costs. 

Credit Facilities 

Refer to the 2015 10-K for a summary and description of our outstanding credit facilities, including the underlying financial and non-financial covenants, which are incorporated herein by reference.  On April 7, 2015, five of our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into 2015 Revolving Credit Facility which provided for a $59.5 million revolving

credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that has since expired. Additionally, on November 4, 2015, thirteen of our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into the $98 Million Credit facility which was used for working capital purposes. 

Refer to Note 8  Debt in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding agreements and waivers that were entered into for our nine credit facilities, as well as the terms and fees associated with those agreements and waivers. 

At September 30, 2016, we believed we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the $100 Million Term Loan Facility; $253 Million Term Loan Facility; the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility; the $98 Million Credit Facility; the $44 Million Term Loan Facility; $22 Million Term Loan Facility; the $148 Million Credit Facility; and the 2014 Term Loan Facilities, other than covenants that had been waived by our lenders as of such date pursuant to the Second Amended Commitment Letter, the Amended $98 Million Credit Facility Commitment Letter and the October 14, 2016 waiver agreements entered into for the 2014 Term Loan Facilities.  These commitment letters and waiver agreements are effective through November 15, 2016.  Refer to Note 8   Debt in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of each credit facility and the terms and conditions of the waivers and commitment letters.  Each of our credit facilities contain cross default provisions that could be triggered by our failure to satisfy or waive our collateral maintenance covenants once the waivers expire.  Given the existence of the cross default provisions, and the absence of any current solution which would cure the noncompliance for at least the next 12 months, absent entering into the New Facility as described in Note 8   Debt in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we have determined that we should classify our outstanding indebtedness, net of unamortized deferred financing costs, of $540.5 million as a current liability as of September 30, 2016 in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Interest Rate Swap Agreements, Forward Freight Agreements and Currency Swap Agreements 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any interest rate swap agreements.  As part of our business strategy, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates.  In determining the fair value of interest rate derivatives, we would consider the creditworthiness of both the counterparty and ourselves immaterial. Valuations prior to any adjustments for credit risk would be validated by comparison with counterparty valuations.  Amounts would not and should not be identical due to the different modeling assumptions.  Any material differences would be investigated. 

As part of our business strategy, we may enter into arrangements commonly known as forward freight agreements, or FFAs, to hedge and manage market risks relating to the deployment of our existing fleet of vessels.  These arrangements may include future contracts, or commitments to perform in the future a shipping service between ship owners, charterers and traders.  Generally, these arrangements would bind us and each counterparty in the arrangement to buy or sell a specified tonnage freighting commitment  forward  at an agreed time and price and for a particular route.  Although FFAs can be entered into for a variety of purposes, including for hedging, as an option, for trading or for arbitrage, if we decided to enter into FFAs, our objective would be to hedge and manage market risks as part of our commercial management. It is not currently our intention to enter into FFAs to generate a stream of income independent of the revenues we derive from the operation of our fleet of vessels.  If we determine to enter into FFAs, we may reduce our exposure to any declines in our results from operations due to weak market conditions or downturns, but may also limit our ability to benefit economically during periods of strong demand in the market.  We have not entered into any FFAs as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Contractual Obligations 

The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and their maturity dates as of September 30, 2016.  The table incorporates the employment agreement entered into in September 2007 with our President, John Wobensmith.  The interest and borrowing fees and scheduled credit agreement payments below reflect the $100 Million Term Loan Facility, the $253 Million Term Loan Facility, the $44 Million Term Loan Facility, the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, the $98 Million Credit Facility, the $22 Million Term Loan Facility, the 2014 Term Loan Facilities and the $148 Million Credit Facility, as well as other fees associated with the facilities.

On October 26, 2016, we paid down $2.5 million on the $148 Million Credit Facility with net proceeds from the sale of the Genco Pioneer, a vessel collateralized under this facility.  Additionally, on or around November 4, 2016, we expect to pay down $3.4 million on the $148 Million Credit Facility with net proceeds from the sale of the Genco Leader, a vessel collateralized under this facility.  Refer to Note 20   Subsequent Events in our condensed consolidated financial statements.  We have adjusted the credit agreement payments and interest and borrowing fees accordingly.     

(3) 

On October 21, 2016, we paid down $2.3 million on the $100 Million Term Loan Facility with net proceeds from the sale of the Genco Sugar, a vessel collateralized under this facility.   Refer to Note 20   Subsequent Events in our condensed consolidated financial statements.  We have adjusted the credit agreement payments and interest and borrowing fees accordingly.     

Interest expense has been estimated using 0.89% plus the applicable margin of 3.50% for the $100 Million Term Loan Facility and the $253 Million Term Loan Facility, 4.25% for the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility and 6.125% for the $98 Million Credit Facility.  For the $22 Million Term Loan Facility and the $44 Million Term Loan Facility, interest expense has been estimated using 0.89% plus the applicable margin of 3.35%.  Lastly, interest expense has been estimated using 0.89% plus the applicable margin for the $148 Million Credit Facility and for the 2014 Term Loan Facilities of 3.00% and 2.50%, respectively. 

Capital Expenditures 

We make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with our vessel acquisitions.  Excluding the Genco Leader which was sold on November 4, 2016, our fleet currently consists of 66 drybulk vessels, including 13 Capesize drybulk carriers, seven Panamax drybulk carriers, four Ultramax drybulk carriers, 21 Supramax drybulk carriers, five Handymax drybulk carriers and 16 Handysize drybulk carriers. 

As previously announced, we have initiated a fuel efficiency upgrade program for certain of our vessels. We believe this program will generate considerable fuel savings going forward and increase the future earnings potential for these vessels. The upgrades have been successfully installed on 16 of our vessels, which completed their respective planned drydockings during 2014 and 2015.  Currently, we do not expect to install fuel efficiency upgrades on any of the vessels scheduled to drydock in 2016. 

Under U.S. Federal law and 33 CFR, Part 151, Subpart D, U.S. approved ballast water treatment systems will be required to be installed in all vessels at the first out of water drydocking after January 1, 2016 if these vessels are to discharge ballast water inside 12 nautical miles of the coast of the United States. Currently, we do not believe there are any ballast water treatment systems that are approved by U.S. authorities. Therefore, the United States Coast Guard   

72 

Table of Contents  

( USCG ) has granted us extensions for our vessels with 2016 drydocking deadlines until January 1, 2018; however, an alternative management system ( AMS ) may be installed in lieu. For example, in February 2015, the USCG added Bawat to the list of ballast water treatment systems that received AMS acceptance. An AMS is valid for five years from the date of required compliance with ballast water discharge standards, by which time it must be replaced by an approved system unless the AMS itself achieves approval. Closer to January 1, 2018, we intend to apply for a supplement to this application in order get a further extension to the vessels  next scheduled drydockings in 2021.  The cost of these systems will vary based on the size of the vessel, and the Company estimates the cost of the systems to be $1.0 million for Capesize, $0.8 million for Panamax, $0.8 million for Supramax, $0.7 million for Handymax and $0.7 million for Handysize vessels. Any newbuilding vessels that we acquire will have an AMS installed when the vessel is being built. Additionally, for our vessels scheduled to drydock in 2017 and 2018, the USCG has granted an extension that enables us to defer installation to the next scheduled drydocking.  In addition, on September 8, 2016, the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) ratified the Ballast Water Management Convention which will be in effect on September 8, 2017.  This will require vessels to have ballast water treatment systems installed to coincide with the vessels  next International Oil Pollution Prevention renewal survey after September 8, 2017.  The costs of ballast water treatment systems will be capitalized and depreciated over the remainder of the life of the vessel, assuming the system the Company installs becomes approved by both the IMO and the USCG. These amounts would be in addition to the amounts budgeted for drydocking below. 

In addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods, we will incur additional expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings for our fleet. We estimate our drydocking costs, including capitalized costs incurred during drydocking related to vessel assets and vessel equipment, and scheduled off-hire days for our fleet through 2017 to be: 

(1) 

Estimated drydocking costs during the remainder of 2016 and 2017 include $1.5 million and $4.8 million of costs, respectively, for vessels that could potentially be sold or scrapped as per the terms of the Second Amended Commitment Letter.  Refer to Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.     

(2) 

Estimated offhire days during the remainder of 2016 and 2017 include 60 and 125 days, respectively, for vessels that could potentially be sold or scrapped as per the terms of the Second Amended Commitment Letter.  Refer to Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.     

The costs reflected are estimates based on drydocking our vessels in China. Actual costs will vary based on various factors, including where the drydockings are actually performed.  We expect to fund these costs with cash from operations.  These costs do not include drydock expense items that are reflected in vessel operating expenses, including the write-off of any steel that is replaced during drydocking.  Additionally, these costs do not include the cost of ballast water treatment systems as noted above. 

Actual length of drydocking will vary based on the condition of the vessel, yard schedules and other factors.  Higher repairs and maintenance expense during drydocking for vessels which are over 15 years old typically result in a higher number of off-hire days depending on the condition of the vessel. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred a total of $2.0 million and $10.3 million of drydocking costs, respectively, excluding costs incurred during drydocking that were capitalized to vessel assets or vessel equipment.   

Three of our vessels completed drydockings during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, there was one drydocking that began in September 2016 and crossed over into the fourth quarter.  We estimate that three of our vessels will be drydocked during the remainder of 2016 and 18 of our vessels will be drydocked during 2017,

which includes the vessels that could potentially be sold or scrapped as per the terms of the Second Amended Commitment Letter. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Inflation 

Inflation has only a moderate effect on our expenses given current economic conditions. In the event that significant global inflationary pressures appear, these pressures would increase our operating, voyage, general and administrative, and financing costs. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

There have been no changes or updates to the critical accounting policies as disclosed in the 2015 10-K. 

Vessels and Depreciation 

We record the value of our vessels at their cost (which includes acquisition costs directly attributable to the vessel and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage) less accumulated depreciation.  We depreciate our drybulk vessels on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, estimated to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard.  Depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value of $310/lwt based on the 15-year average scrap value of steel.  An increase in the residual value of the vessels will decrease the annual depreciation charge over the remaining useful life of the vessels.  Similarly, an increase in the useful life of a drybulk vessel would also decrease the annual depreciation charge.  Comparatively, a decrease in the useful life of a drybulk vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge.  However, when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, we will adjust the vessel s useful life to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessel s further commercial use. 

The carrying value of each of our vessels does not represent the fair market value of such vessel or the amount we could obtain if we were to sell any of our vessels, which could be more or less.  Under U.S. GAAP, we would not record a loss if the fair market value of a vessel (excluding its charter) is below our carrying value unless and until we determine to sell that vessel or the vessel is impaired as discussed in the 2015 10-K.  Excluding the three Bourbon vessels we resold immediately upon delivery to MEP at our cost, we have sold four of our vessels since our inception.  We realized a profit for the three vessels sold during prior years and realized a loss of $0.1 million for the sale of the Genco Marine on May 17, 2016 which was scrapped.  Additionally, we incurred a $53.8 million loss from the forfeiture of our deposit and related interest when we determined to cancel an acquisition of six drybulk newbuildings in November 2008. 

During October 2016, we sold two of our vessels, the Genco Sugar and Genco Pioneer.  Additionally, on November 4, 2016, we sold the Genco Leader.  Refer to Note 20       Subsequent Events in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $69.3 million and $35.4 million, impairment of vessel assets, respectively.  The $69.3 million impairment expense recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $67.6 million impairment loss for nine of our vessels (the Genco Acheron, Genco Carrier, Genco Leader, Genco Pioneer, Genco Prosperity, Genco Reliance, Genco Success, Genco Sugar and Genco Wisdom) for which we had determined it is more likely than not will be scrapped pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter that we originally entered into on June 8, 2016.  Additionally, a $1.7 million impairment loss was recorded during the first quarter of 2016 for the Genco Marine when we had determined that it was more likely than not that the vessel would be scrapped.  On April 5, 2016, the Board of Directors unanimously approved scrapping the Genco Marine and it was sold

to a demolition yard and scrapped on May 17, 2016.  Similarly, the $35.4 million impairment expense recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was for the Baltic Lion and Baltic Tiger for which we had determined it was more likely than not that the vessels would be sold based on Baltic Trading s expressed consideration to divest of those vessels to increase its liquidity position and strengthen our balance sheet.  On April 7, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Baltic Trading to purchase the Baltic Lion and Baltic Tiger for an aggregate purchase price of $68.5 million, not including commission, which closed on April 8, 2015.  Refer to Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information which describes how we determined that these vessel assets were impaired.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there was no impairment of vessel assets. 

Pursuant to our bank credit facilities, we regularly submit to the lenders valuations of our vessels on an individual charter free basis in order to evidence our compliance with the collateral maintenance covenants under our bank credit facilities.  Such a valuation is not necessarily the same as the amount any vessel may bring upon sale, which may be more or less, and should not be relied upon as such.  Compliance with the collateral maintenance covenants have been waived under our $100 Million Term Loan Facility; $253 Million Term Loan Facility; 2015 Revolving Credit Facility; $44 Million Term Loan Facility; $148 Million Credit Facility; 2014 Term Loan Facilities; and the $22 Million Term Loan Facility through November 15, 2016 pursuant to the Second Amended Commitment Letter and the waiver entered into on October 14, 2016 for the 2014 Term Loan Facilities.  Additionally, pursuant to the Amended $98 Million Credit Facility Commitment Letter entered into on September 29, 2016, the collateral maintenance covenant has been reduced from 140% to 120% through November 15, 2016.  Refer to Note 8   Debt in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. We obtained valuations for all of the vessels in our fleet pursuant to the terms of the credit facilities.  For unencumbered vessels, we utilized the June 30, 2016 vessel valuations as of September 30, 2016 and the December 31, 2015 vessel valuations as of December 31, 2015. In the chart below, we list each of our vessels, the year it was built, the year we acquired it, and its carrying value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Vessels have been grouped according to their collateralized status as of September 30, 2016.  The carrying value of   the Genco Acheron, Genco Carrier, Genco Leader, Genco Pioneer, Genco Prosperity, Genco Reliance, Genco Success, Genco Sugar, and Genco Wisdom   at September 30, 2016 reflects the impairment loss recorded for these vessels. 

At September 30, 2016, the vessel valuations of all of our vessels for covenant compliance purposes under our bank credit facilities as of the most recent compliance testing date were lower than their carrying values at September 30, 2016, with the exception of the nine aforementioned vessels, which were written down to their estimated net realizable value as of June 30, 2016 as it was determined that the vessels assets were impaired.  At December 31, 2015, the vessel valuations of all of our vessels for covenant compliance purposes under our bank credit facilities as of the most recent compliance testing date were lower than their carrying values at December 31, 2015, with the exception of the Genco Marine, which was unencumbered at December 31, 2015 and was written down to its fair market value as it was determined that the vessel asset was impaired as of December 31, 2015.  Refer to Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

The amount by which the carrying value at September 30, 2016 of all of the vessels in our fleet, with the exception of the nine aforementioned vessels, exceeded the valuation of such vessels for covenant compliance purposes ranged, on an individual vessel basis, from $5.0 million to $23.5 million per vessel, and $733.2 million on an aggregate fleet basis.  The amount by which the carrying value at December 31, 2015 of all of the vessels in our fleet, with the exception of the Genco Marine, exceeded the valuation of such vessels for covenant compliance purposes ranged, on an individual vessel basis, from $3.3 million to $21.8 million per vessel, and $699.9 million on an aggregate fleet basis.  The average amount by which the carrying value of our vessels exceeded the valuation of such vessels for covenant compliance purposes was $12.2 million at September 30, 2016 and $10.1 million as of December 31, 2015.  However, neither such valuation nor the carrying value in the table below reflects the value of long-term time charters related to some of our vessels.

If we were to sell a vessel or hold a vessel for sale, and the carrying value of the vessel were to exceed its fair market value, we would record a loss in the amount of the difference.  See above for information regarding the sale of the Baltic Lion, Baltic Tiger and the Genco Marine and Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the classification of the vessel assets for the Genco Sugar and Genco Pioneer as held for sale as of September 30, 2016. 

ITEM 3  .           QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Interest rate risk 

We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes.  Our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flow in relation to our borrowings.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any interest rate swap agreements to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. 

We are subject to market risks relating to changes in LIBOR rates because we have significant amounts of floating rate debt outstanding.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we were subject to the following interest rates on the outstanding debt under our credit facilities: 

78 

Table of Contents  

A 1% increase in LIBOR would result in an increase of $4.3 million in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Derivative financial instruments 

As part of our business strategy, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any derivative financial instruments. 

Refer to  Interest rate risk  section above for further information regarding the interest rate swap agreements. 

Currency and exchange rates risk 

The international shipping industry s functional currency is the U.S. Dollar.  Virtually all of our revenues and most of our operating costs are in U.S. Dollars.  We incur certain operating expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and the foreign exchange risk associated with these operating expenses is immaterial. 

As part of our business strategy, we may enter into short-term forward currency contracts to protect ourselves from the risk arising from the fluctuation in the exchange rate associated with the cost basis of the Jinhui shares. 

Investments 

We hold investments in equity securities of Jinhui, which are classified as available for sale ( AFS ) under Accounting Standards Codification 320-10,  Investments   Debt and Equity Securities  ( ASC 320-10 ).  Pursuant to guidance in ASC 320-10, changes between our cost basis in these securities and their market value are recognized as an adjustment to their carrying values with an offsetting adjustment to AOCI at each reporting date.  We review the carrying value of such investments on a quarterly basis to determine if there are any indicators of other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with ASC 320-10.  Based on our review as of September 30, 2016, we did not deem our investment in Jinhui to be other-than-temporarily impaired.  However, based on our review as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we deemed our investment in Jinhui to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to the duration and severity of the decline in its market value versus its cost basis and the absence of the intent and ability to recover the initial carrying value of the investment.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, a total loss of $0 and $2.7 million, respectively, has been recorded as impairment of investment in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.  Additionally, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, a total loss of $32.5 million has been recorded as impairment of investment in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.  We will continue to evaluate the carrying value of such investments on a quarterly basis.  Refer to Note 5   Investments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ITEM 4  .            CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II:            OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

In April 2015, six class action complaints were filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York.  On May 26, 2015, the six actions were consolidated under the caption In Re Baltic Trading Ltd. Stockholder Litigation, Index No. 651241/2015, and a consolidated class action complaint was filed on June 10, 2015 (the  Consolidated Complaint ).  The Consolidated Complaint is purported to be brought by and on behalf of Baltic Trading s shareholders and alleges that the then-proposed July 2015 merger did not fairly compensate Baltic Trading s shareholders and undervalued Baltic Trading.  The Consolidated Complaint names as defendants the Company, Baltic Trading, the individual members of Baltic Trading s board, and the Company s merger subsidiary. The claims generally allege (i) breaches of fiduciary duties of good faith, due care, disclosure to shareholders, and loyalty, including for failing to maximize shareholder value, and (ii) aiding and abetting those breaches. Among other relief, the complaints seek an injunction against the merger, declaratory judgments that the individual defendants breached fiduciary duties, rescission of the merger agreement, and unspecified damages.   

On July 9, 2015, plaintiffs in that action moved to enjoin the merger vote, scheduled to take place on July 17, 2015.  The motion was thereafter fully briefed and argued on July 15, 2015.  The motion to enjoin the vote was denied on July 15, 2015 (the  Preliminary Injunction Denial ).  Plaintiffs sought an emergency injunction and temporary restraining order from the New York State Appellate Division, First Department the following day, on July 16, 2015.  The Appellate Division denied the request, and the vote, and subsequent merger, proceeded as scheduled on July 17, 2015.  Plaintiffs thereafter withdrew that appeal.  

On June 30, 2015, Defendants had moved to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint in its entirety.  Plaintiffs subsequently served an Amended Consolidated Complaint, and Defendants directed their motion to dismiss to that amended complaint.  The motion to dismiss was granted and the Amended Consolidated Complaint was dismissed with prejudice on August 29, 2016 (the  Dismissal Decision ).       

On September 29, 2016, plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, which recites their appeal of the Dismissal Decision,  including ... and as referenced in  the Dismissal Order, the Preliminary Injunction Denial. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the 2015 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Below is updated information for the risk factor entitled,  We are subject to regulation and liability under environmental and operational safety laws that could require significant expenditures and affect our cash flows and net income and could subject us to increased liability under applicable law or regulation. :  

On October 27, 2016, the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) announced the results from a vote to ratify and formalize regulations mandating a reduction in sulfur emissions from 3.5% currently to 0.5% as of the beginning of 2020 rather than pushing the deadline back to 2025. By 2020 ships will now have to either remove sulfur from emissions through the use of emission scrubbers or buy fuel with low sulfur content. Scrubbers can cost $3-$10 million to install on existing ships.  If a vessel is not retrofitted with a scrubber, it will need to use low sulfur fuel, which is more expensive that standard marine fuel.  This increased demand for low sulfur fuel may result in an increase in prices for such fuel.   

In addition, below is updated information for the risk factor entitled,  We may have to pay U.S. tax on U.S. source income, which would reduce our net income and cash flows.  

The change in the Company s share ownership resulting from the transactions contemplated by the Initial Purchase Agreements and the Additional Purchase Agreements may cause the Company to be no longer being eligible for an exemption under Section 883 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from paying income tax on shipping income that is derived from U.S. sources.

(b)  be deemed to constitute an amendment or waiver of any provision of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document or a commitment to amend, waive or restructure any provision in the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document. 

Any such correspondence, meeting or discussion in each case shall be entirely without prejudice to the rights, powers and remedies of the Finance Parties under or in respect of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document and all such rights, powers and remedies are expressly reserved.

6.4  During the Waiver Period, the Borrower undertakes and acknowledges that the Lenders are entitled to receive, have received and may continue to receive information regarding the Group under or in connection with the Finance Documents. The Security Parties agree that nothing in this letter shall in any way impede, impair, limit or restrict any Lender s rights to obtain and use such information in any manner and for any purpose permitted under the Finance Documents. 

6.5  The Borrower hereby represents and warrants that (a) the representations and warranties of the Security Parties set forth in the each of the Finance Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date hereof to the same extent as though made on and as of such date except to the extent such representations and warranties specifically relate to an earlier date and (b) after giving effect to the Waiver, no event has occurred and is continuing which constitutes a default or Event of Default under any Finance Document or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Event of Default. 

6.6  The Security Parties affirm all of their obligations under each Finance Document as modified hereby and agree that this letter shall not operate to reduce or discharge their obligations under any Finance Document. 

7      Continuing Security

Exhibit 10.14 

EXHIBIT A 

RELEASE AGREEMENT 

This RELEASE AGREEMENT (this    Agreement   ) dated October 13, 2016, is made and entered into by and between Genco Shipping   Trading Limited (the    Company   ), and Peter C. Georgiopoulos (the    Former Director   ). 

WHEREAS, the Former Director has resigned effective October 13, 2016; and 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Separation Agreement between the Former Director and the Company, dated October 13, 2016, (the    Separation Agreement   ) it is a condition precedent to the Company s obligations to make certain payments under Section 2 of the Separation Agreement and that Former Director executes and delivers this Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements contained herein and in the Separation Agreement, the sufficiency and receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Former Director agrees as follows: 

1.          General Release and Waiver of Claims  . 

(a)  In consideration for the benefits provided to Former Director under the Separation Agreement (the    Consideration   ), Former Director hereby releases and forever discharges and holds the Company, subsidiaries of the Company, affiliates of the Company and each officer, director, employee, partner (general and limited), equity holder, member, manager, agent, subsidiary, affiliate, successor and assign and insurer of any of the foregoing (collectively, the    Releasees   ) harmless from all claims or suits, of any nature whatsoever (whether known or unknown), being directly or indirectly related to Former Director s service with the Company or the termination thereof, including, but not limited to, any claims for notice, pay in lieu of notice, wrongful dismissal, discrimination, harassment, severance pay, bonus, incentive compensation, interest, any claims relating to Former Director s service as with the Company, through the date hereof.   

(b)  This release includes, but is not limited to, contract and tort claims, claims arising out of any legal restriction on the Company s right to terminate its employees and claims or rights under federal, state, and local laws prohibiting employment discrimination, including, but not limited to, claims or rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Civil Rights Act of 1991; the Equal Pay Act; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (   ADEA   ), including the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990; the Americans with Disabilities Act; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and any other federal, state, or local law (statutory or decisional), regulation or ordinance (if and to the extent applicable and as the same may be amended from time to time), or under any public policy, contract or tort, or under common law; or arising under any policies, practices or procedures of the Releasees; or any claim for wrongful discharge, breach of contract, infliction of emotional distress, defamation; or any claim for costs, fees,  

1 

or other expenses (including attorneys  fees incurred in these matters), which arose through the date Former Director executes this Agreement.  

(c)  Former Director acknowledges that the consideration given for this Agreement is in addition to anything of value to which Former Director was already entitled.   

(d)  Former Director acknowledges that because this Agreement contains a general release of all claims including under the ADEA, and is an important legal document, he has been advised to consult with legal counsel of his own choosing.  Former Director may take up to twenty-one (21) days to decide whether to execute this Agreement, and he may revoke his signature by delivering or mailing a signed notice of revocation to the Company at its corporate offices within seven (7) days after executing it.   

(e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement does not release (i) claims which cannot be lawfully released, (ii) Former Director s rights of indemnification and directors  and officers  liability insurance coverage, if any, to which he is entitled with regard to his service as a director of the Company and (iii) claims with respect to the breach of any covenant to be performed by the Company pursuant to this Agreement or any other claims arising from actions or omissions occurring after the date of this Agreement.  Further, the release contained herein does not, and shall not be construed to, release or limit the scope of any existing obligation of the Company with respect to payments to be made under Section  2 of the Separation Agreement. 

(f)  Former Director acknowledges that there is a risk that after signing this Agreement he may discover losses or claims that are released under this Agreement, but that are presently unknown to him.  Former Director assumes this risk and understands that this Agreement shall apply to any such losses and claims.  Former Director understands that this Agreement includes a full and final release covering all known and unknown, suspected or unsuspected injuries, debts, claims or damages which have arisen or may have arisen from any matters, acts, omissions or dealings released herein.  Former Director acknowledges that by accepting the Consideration, he assumes and waives the risks that the facts and the law may be other than as he believes.   

2.        Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to affect the independent right and responsibility of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (   EEOC   ) to enforce the law;   provided  ,    however  , Former Director is barred from receiving any monetary damages in connection with any EEOC proceeding concerning matters covered by this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

3.        This Agreement shall not be construed as an admission by any of the Releasees or the Former Director of any violation of any federal, state or local law. 

4.        FORMER DIRECTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE HAS BEEN ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY; THAT TO THE EXTENT HE HAS DESIRED, HE HAS AVAILED HIMSELF OF THAT RIGHT; THAT HE HAS CAREFULLY READ AND  

2 

UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT; AND THAT HE IS KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT. 

5.          Dispute Resolution  .  Any dispute arising out of, under, pursuant to, or in any way relating to this Agreement shall be governed by Section 5 of the Separation Agreement. 

6.          Miscellaneous

(b)    Construction  .  There shall be no presumption that any ambiguity in this Agreement should be resolved in favor of one party hereto and against another party hereto.  Any controversy concerning the construction of this Agreement shall be decided neutrally without regard to authorship. 

(c)    Counterparts  .

(a)          From and after the Closing until the conversion of the Shares, and thereafter and until the Investors no longer beneficially own (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) at least 12.5% of the total outstanding Common Stock at any time (the    Nomination Right Termination   ), at each annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which directors are to be elected to the Board of Directors, the Company (subject to applicable law, including any fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors) shall nominate and use its commercially reasonable efforts (which shall include inserting in any proxy statement used by the Company to solicit the vote of its stockholders in connection with any such meeting the recommendation of the Board of Directors that stockholders of the Company vote in favor of each Investor Designee (defined below)) to cause the election to the Board of Directors of a slate of directors that includes one (1) individual designated in writing by the Investors for nomination for election or for appointment to the Board of Directors and approved by the Board of Directors or any responsible committee thereof (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) (any such individual being an    Investor Designee   ); except that if the Investors beneficially own at least 25% of the total outstanding Common Stock and the size of the Board has been increased to nine (9) members, the number of Investor Designees that the Investors shall be entitled to designate shall be two (2).  To the extent that the Company s Board of Directors or any responsible committee thereof views it as necessary or desirable that any second Investor Designee of the Investors be independent under the applicable rules of any exchange on which the Company s capital stock is listed or for regulatory compliance purposes, the Investors shall comply with the request of the Company to designate a second Investor Designee that would be independent under such rules or regulations or, if such second Investor Designee has already been elected or appointed to the Company s Board of Directors (an    Investor Director   ), shall secure the resignation of such Investor Director and designate an Investor Designee who would be independent under such rules or regulations.   

(b)          The Investors shall notify the Company of the identity of any proposed Investor Designee, in writing, at or before the time such information is reasonably requested by the Board of Directors or any responsible committee thereof for inclusion in a proxy statement for a meeting of stockholders, and shall promptly furnish in writing all information about the Investors and such proposed Investor Designee as shall be reasonably requested by the Board of Directors or any responsible committee thereof (including, at a minimum, any information regarding such proposed Investor Designee to the extent required by applicable securities laws or for any other person nominated for election to the Board of Directors). 

(c)          Until the Nomination Right Termination and subject to Sections 7.11(a) and (b), in the event of (i) the death, disability, removal or resignation of an Investor Director, the Board of Directors (subject to applicable law, including any fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors) shall promptly appoint as a replacement Investor Director the Investor Designee designated by the Investors to  

23 

fill the resulting vacancy, or (ii) the failure of an Investor Designee to be elected to the Board of Directors at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which such Investor Designee stood for election but was nevertheless not elected (such Investor Designee, an    Investor Specified Designee   ), the Board of Directors (subject to applicable law, including any fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors) shall promptly appoint another Investor Designee designated by the Investors to serve in lieu of such Investor Specified Designee as an Investor Director during the term that such Investor Specified Designee would have served had such Investor Specified Designee been elected at such meeting of the stockholders of the Company, and, in each case of clause (i) and clause (ii), such individual shall then be deemed an Investor Director for all purposes hereunder. 

(d)          The Company shall at all times provide each Investor Director (in his or her capacity as a member of the Board of Directors) with the same rights to indemnification and exculpation that it provides to the other members of the Board of Directors.  The Company acknowledges and agrees that any such obligations to indemnify or advance expenses to each Investor Director, in his or her capacity as such, for the matters covered by such obligations, shall be the primary source of indemnification and advancement of such Investor Director in connection therewith, and any obligation on the part of any Investor under any indemnification agreement to indemnify or advance expenses to such Investor Director shall be secondary to the Company s obligation and shall be reduced by any amount that such Investor Director may collect as indemnification or advancement from the Company.  In the event that the Company fails to indemnify or advance expenses to such Investor Director as required by such indemnification obligations and this Agreement (such unpaid amounts, the    Unpaid Indemnitee Amounts   ), and any Investor makes any payment to such Investor Director in respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses on account of such Unpaid Indemnitee Amounts, such Investor shall be subrogated to the rights of such Investor Director under this Agreement in respect of such Unpaid Indemnitee Amounts. 

(e)          The first Investor Director shall be Bao D. Truong, and the second Investor Director shall be Kevin Mahony, subject to the last sentence of Section 7.12(a). 

7.13        Prior Registration Rights Agreement  .  The Investors shall cause funds and/or related entities managed by Affiliates of Centerbridge Partners, L.P. that are parties to the Prior Registration Rights Agreement to give their reasonable consent to conform terms of the Prior Registration Rights Agreement to the Registration Rights Agreement.

8.1          Survival  .  The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

8.2          Indemnification  .

24 

8.3          Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings  .  Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party;   provided   that any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (a) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses, or (b) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person or (c) in the reasonable judgment of any such Person, based upon written advice of its counsel, a conflict of interest exists between such Person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such Person); and   provided  ,    further  , that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure to give notice shall materially adversely affect the indemnifying party in the defense of any such claim or litigation.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for fees or expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all such indemnified parties.  No indemnifying party will, except with the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation and, in the event an indemnified party controls the defense of any claim under this Section 8.3, such indemnified party may not settle such claim without the Company s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.

The decision of each Investor to purchase Securities  

27 

pursuant to the Transaction Documents has been made by such Investor independently of any other Investor.  Nothing contained herein or in any Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Investor pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Investors as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Investors are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.  Each Investor acknowledges that no other Investor has acted as agent for such Investor in connection with making its investment hereunder and that no Investor will be acting as agent of such Investor in connection with monitoring its investment in the Securities or enforcing its rights under the Transaction Documents.  Each Investor shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Investor to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.  The Company acknowledges that each of the Investors and the Other Existing Investors has been provided with the same transaction documents for the purpose of closing a transaction with multiple Persons and not because it was required or requested to do so by any Person. 

9.13       Reliance by and Exculpation of Agents  .

Each Investor further represents and warrants to each Agent that it, including any fund or funds that it manages or advises that participates in the offer and sale of the Shares, is permitted under its constitutive documents (including, without limitation, all limited partnership agreements, charters, bylaws, limited liability company agreements, all applicable side letters with investors, and similar documents) to make investments of the type contemplated by this Agreement.  In light of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Investor releases each Agent, its employees, officers, representatives and Affiliates from any liability with respect to such Investor s participation in the offer and sale of the Shares including, but not limited to, any improper payment made in accordance with the information provided by the Company. This Section 9.13 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  The Agents have introduced each Investor to the Company in reliance on the Investor s understanding and agreement to this Section 9.13. 

(b)          The parties agree and acknowledge that each Agent may rely on the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement and may rely on the representations and warranties of the respective Investors contained in this Agreement as if such representations, warranties, agreements and covenants, as applicable, were made directly to such Agent.  The parties further agree each Agent may rely on the legal opinions to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.1(i) hereof. 

(c)          Each Investor agrees, for the express benefit of the Agents, that: no Agent, nor any of its Affiliates or any of its representatives (1) has any duties or obligations with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby other than those specifically set forth herein or in the engagement letter, to be entered into between the Company and the Agents; (2) shall be liable for any improper payment made in accordance with the information provided by the Company; (3) makes any representation or  

28 

warranty, or has any responsibilities as to the validity, accuracy, value or genuineness of any information, certificates or documentation delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents; or (4) shall be liable to such Investor (x) for any action taken, suffered or omitted by any of them in good faith and reasonably believed to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Agreement or any Transaction Document or (y) for anything which any of them may do or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement or any Transaction Document, except for such Agent s own gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith.  Jefferies, its Affiliates and its representatives shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Company for acting as placement agent hereunder pursuant the indemnification provisions set forth in the Engagement Letter. 

9.14        Non-Recourse  . All actions, obligations, losses or causes of action (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to (a) this Agreement and/or any other Transaction Document, (b) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and/or any other Transaction Document, (c) any breach or violation of this Agreement and/or any other Transaction Document and (d) any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby or in the other Transaction Documents to be consummated, in each case, may only be made against (and are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly named as parties hereto or thereto to the extent set forth herein and therein. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or otherwise to the contrary, each party covenants, agrees and acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and its and their respective representatives, that no recourse under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall be had against (i) any past, present or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited partner, stockholder, incorporator, representative or assignee of any party hereto or thereto (unless such Person is also a party) or (ii) any past, present or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited partner, stockholder, incorporator, representative or assignee of any of the foregoing (unless such Person is also a party), and none of the foregoing shall have any liability hereunder or thereunder (in each case, whether in tort, contract or otherwise), it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability or losses whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any of the aforementioned, as such, arising out of, in connection with or related in any manner to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (a) through (d).

CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS OF RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES OF 

SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK OF 

GENCO SHIPPING   TRADING LIMITED 

The undersigned, John C. Wobensmith, does hereby certify:  

1.        That he is the duly elected and acting President and Secretary of Genco Shipping   Trading Limited a Marshall Islands corporation (the    Company   ).  

2.        That pursuant to the authority conferred by the Company s Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, the Company s Board of Directors on [__________], 2016 adopted the following resolution designating and prescribing the relative rights, preferences and limitations of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock:  

RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors (the    Board   ) of the Company by the Articles of Incorporation, the Board does hereby establish a series of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, and the designation and certain powers, preferences and other special rights of the shares of such series, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, are hereby fixed as follows: 

Section 1.   Designation and Amount  .  The shares of such series shall be designated as    Series A Preferred Stock   .  The  Series A Preferred Stock shall have a par value of $0.01 per share, and the number of shares constituting such series shall initially be 27,061,856, which number the Board may from time to time increase or decrease (but not below the number then outstanding).  The Series A Preferred Stock shall have a liquidation preference of $4.85 per share (the    Liquidation Preference   ). 

Section 2.   Ranking  .  The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company, (a) senior to the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the    Common Stock   ), whether now outstanding or hereafter issued, and to each other class or series of stock of the Company (including any series of preferred stock established after [___________], 2016 (the    Issue Date   ) by the Board of Directors) the terms of which do not expressly provide that such class or series ranks senior to, or   pari     passu,   with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as    Junior Stock   ); (b)   pari     passu   with each other class or series of stock of the Company established after the Issue Date by the Board of Directors the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series ranks   pari     passu   with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as    Parity Stock   ); and (c) junior to each other class or series of stock of the Company established after the Issue Date by the Board of Directors the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series ranks senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as    Senior Stock   ). The Company s ability to issue Capital Stock that ranks   pari passu   with or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.  

Section 3.   Dividends  .  (a) Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock payable semiannually, which dividends shall be declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of the assets of the Company legally available therefor, and shall be payable semiannually commencing on the 180th day following the Issue Date (or the following Business Day if any such payment date is not a Business Day) (each such date being referred to herein as a    Dividend Payment Date   ) at the rate per annum of 6% per share on the Liquidation Preference;   provided   that, in the event that on any Dividend Payment Date, the 

34 

Company is not permitted to declare or pay such dividend or incur such liability either (x) as a matter of law or (y) under the terms of any loan agreement, credit agreement, guaranty, or related agreement, such dividend (a    Deferred Dividend   ) shall not be declared by the Board of Directors, shall not be paid or payable on such Dividend Payment Date and no liability shall be incurred in respect thereof, and instead, such Deferred Dividend shall be declared, become payable and be paid and the liability in respect thereof be incurred on the first succeeding Dividend Payment Date on which the Company is not prohibited from declaring, paying and incurring the liability in respect of such Deferred Dividend (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Deferred Dividend shall be payable in addition to, and not in lieu of, any dividend which would ordinarily be payable on such succeeding Dividend Payment Date). The amount of dividends payable for any other period that is shorter or longer than a full semiannual dividend period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. 

Commencing on and following the Meeting End Date, in the event that dividends are paid on shares of Common Stock in any dividend period with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, then a dividend shall be payable in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock for such period in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount otherwise payable in respect of such share of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the foregoing paragraph and (ii) the product of (A) the aggregate dividends payable per share of Common Stock in such dividend period times (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible.  

For purposes of this Section 3(a), a dividend period with respect to a Dividend Payment Date is the period commencing on the preceding Dividend Payment Date (or, if there is no preceding Dividend Payment Date, the Issue Date) and ending on the day immediately prior to the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends payable on a Dividend Payment Date shall be payable to Holders of record on the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof declares the dividend payable (each, a    Dividend Record Date   ).  

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3(a) to the contrary, and without limiting any other remedy available to the Company or any other party, dividends shall not accrue or be payable in respect of shares initially issued any Holder who is contractually obligated to appear and vote in favor of any proposal made at a meeting of stockholders of the Company in order to effect the Stockholder Approval (or whose transferor Holder was so obligated) if such Holder (or such transferor Holder or the Affiliates of either) fails so to appear and vote in favor.  Any shares issued to such Holders shall bear the Stockholder Approval Legend. 

(b)   Payment of Dividends  . The Company may make each dividend payment on the Series A Preferred Stock either (i) in cash (or, if applicable, in the same form as such dividend is paid to holders of Common Stock) or (ii) at the Company s option, by the issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including fractional shares) having an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the amount of the dividend to be paid (or, in the case of a non-cash distribution, having an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the fair market value of such dividend (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution)). Each fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall be entitled to a ratably proportionate amount of all dividends accumulating with respect to each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3, and all such dividends with respect to such outstanding fractional shares shall accumulate (whether or not declared) and shall be payable in the same manner and at such times as provided for in Section 3 with respect to dividends on each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock. No interest or sum of money in lieu of interest shall be payable in respect of any dividends or payment that may be in arrears.  

(c)   Payment Restrictions  . No dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior  

35 

Stock (in the case of Junior Stock) and other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) may be declared, made or paid, or set apart for payment upon, any Parity Stock or Junior Stock, nor may any Parity Stock or Junior Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any money paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any Parity Stock or Junior Stock) by or on behalf of the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior Stock (in the case of Junior Stock)), unless all accrued and unpaid dividends shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid (in cash or in kind), or are declared and a sum of cash sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for such payment, on the Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of such declaration, payment, redemption, purchase or acquisition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if full dividends have not been paid on the Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, dividends may be declared and paid on the Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock so long as the dividends are declared and paid   pro     rata   so that the aggregate amounts of dividends declared per share on, and the amounts of such dividends declared in cash or in kind, as applicable, per share on, the Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued and unpaid dividends per share on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and such other Parity Stock bear to each other.  

Section 4.   Liquidation Preference  . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, each Holder shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders of the Company, before any distribution of assets is made on the Common Stock or any other Junior Stock, an amount equal to the greater of (i) the aggregate Liquidation Preference attributable to shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15(a), plus an amount equal to the sum of all accrued and unpaid cumulative dividends, and (ii) the product of (x) the amount per share that would have been payable upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up to the holders of shares of Common Stock or such other class or series of securities into which the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible (assuming the conversion of each share of Series A Preferred Stock), multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock or such other securities into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder are then convertible.  

None of (i) the sale of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Company (other than in connection with the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company), (ii) the merger, conversion or consolidation of the Company into or with any other Person or (iii) the merger, conversion or consolidation of any other Person into or with the Company, shall constitute a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company for the purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph.  

In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to Holders upon any liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such Holders are entitled pursuant to this Section 4, no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of Parity Stock upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up unless proportionate distributable amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which Holders and holders of any Parity Stock are entitled upon such liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, with the amount allocable to each series of such stock determined on a   pro rata   basis of the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of each series and accrued and unpaid dividends to which each series is entitled.  

After the payment to the Holders of the full preferential amounts provided for above, the Holders as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.  

36

Section 6.   Conversion  .   

(a)   Mandatory Conversion  . Effective as of the close of business on the Stockholder Approval Date, with respect to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock of a Holder, such Holder s shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically, without any action of such Holder, convert into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate Liquidation Preference of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock   divided by   the Conversion Price then in effect (such quotient, the    Conversion Shares   ).  

(b) In addition, effective as of the close of business on the Stockholder Approval Date, a Holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, at the election of the Company, either (i) cash in an amount equal to the then unpaid Deferred Dividends in respect of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder or (ii) a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the amount of any then unpaid Deferred Dividends in respect of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder   divided by   the Conversion Price then in effect (such quotient, the    Dividend Shares   ).  

No Holder may convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock other than pursuant to Section 6(a).  

(c)   Conversion Procedures  .   

(i) In the event of conversion pursuant to Section 6(a), the Company shall deliver as promptly as practicable written notice to each holder specifying: (A) the Stockholder Approval Date; (B) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock that is converted; (C) the place or places where certificates or evidence of book-entry notation for such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for issuance of certificates or evidence of book-entry notation representing shares of Common Stock; and (D) that dividends on the shares to be converted will cease to accrue on such Stockholder Approval Date. Unless the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion are to be issued in the same name as the name in which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are registered, each share surrendered for mandatory conversion shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the holder thereof or such holder s duly authorized attorney and an amount sufficient to pay any transfer or similar tax in accordance with Section 15(f).  

37 

(ii) The conversion shall be deemed to have been effected at the close of business on the Stockholder Approval Date. At such time: (A) the person in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such mandatory conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby at such time; (B) such shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of a holder with respect to such shares shall immediately terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock and other amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6 and the right to receive any dividend declared but not yet paid pursuant to Section 3.  

(iii) Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the mandatory conversion thereof following such Dividend Record Date and prior to such Dividend Payment Date. In such event, any such dividend that would otherwise be payable in the form of Series A Preferred Stock shall be payable to such Holder either (i) in cash or (ii) at the Company s option, in shares of Common Stock converted at the Conversion Price in effect as of the time of such mandatory conversion.  

(iv) In connection with the mandatory conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, no fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the Company shall pay an amount of cash in respect of such fractional interest equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Stockholder Approval Date.  

Section 7.   Settlement upon Conversion  . The Company shall satisfy its obligation to deliver Conversion Shares and, if applicable, Dividend Shares (or such other class or series of securities into which the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible) upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock by delivering to each Holder surrendering shares of Series A Preferred Stock for conversion a number of shares of Common Stock (or such other class or series of securities into which the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible) equal to the number of Conversion Shares and, if applicable, Dividend Shares to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 6 (  provided   that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares), as soon as practicable after the third Trading Day (but in no event later than the fifth Business Day) following the Stockholder Approval Date. In the event the Company elects to pay cash pursuant to Section 6(b)(i), such cash payment shall be made on the same date.  

Section 8.   Anti-dilution Adjustments  . 

(a) The Conversion Price shall be subject to the following adjustments from time to time:  

(i)   Stock Dividends  . In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in Common Stock, the Conversion Price, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination;   provided  ,    however  , that no such adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution pursuant to Section 3.  

(ii)   Stock Purchase Rights  . In case the Company shall issue to all holders of its Common Stock options, warrants or other rights entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares  

38 

of Common Stock for a period expiring within 60 days from the date of issuance of such options, warrants or other rights at a price per share of Common Stock less than 95% of the Market Value on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such options, warrants or other rights (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment, share purchase or similar plan), the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination   plus   the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration expected to be received by the Company upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such options, warrants or other rights (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) would purchase at such Market Value and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination   plus   the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, either directly or indirectly, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination;   provided  ,    however  , that no such adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such options, warrants or other rights pursuant to Section    provided  ,    further  ,    however  , that if any of the foregoing options, warrants or other rights are only exercisable upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, then the Conversion Price will not be adjusted until such Triggering Event occurs.  

(iii)   Stock Splits, Reverse Splits and Combinations  . In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided, split or reclassified into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or reclassified into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split, reclassification or combination becomes effective.  

(iv)   Debt, Asset or Security Distributions  . 

(A) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, assets or securities (but excluding any dividend or distribution of options, warrants or other rights referred to in paragraph (ii) of this Section 8(a), any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, any dividend or distribution of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-off referred to in the next subparagraph, or any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (i) of this Section 8(a)), the Conversion Price shall be reduced by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Market Value on the date fixed for such determination minus the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be the Market Value on the date fixed for such determination, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior  

39 

to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this subparagraph (iv)(A) is applicable, subparagraph (iv)(B) of this Section 8(a) shall not be applicable. No adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 3.  

(B) In the case of a Spin-off, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution shall be reduced by multiplying the Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Market Value on the date fixed for such determination   minus   the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the shares (or fractions thereof) of Capital Stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be the Market Value. Any adjustment to the Conversion Price under this subparagraph (iv)(B) will occur on the date that is the earlier of (1) the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-off and (2) the date of the Initial Public Offering of the securities being distributed in the Spin-off, if that Initial Public Offering is effected simultaneously with the Spin-off. No adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 3.  

(v)   Tender Offers  . In the case that a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of the Company (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares) of aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) per share of Common Stock that exceeds the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, then, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the last time (the    Expiration Time   ) tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof), the Conversion Price shall be reduced by multiplying the Conversion Price immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Market Value on the date of the Expiration Time and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the Expiration Time, and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Market Value on the date of the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered or exchanged, not withdrawn and accepted for payment on the date of the Expiration Time (such validly tendered or exchanged shares, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the    Purchased Shares   )   plus   (y) the amount of cash   plus   the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of the Company pursuant to the tender or exchange offer (assuming the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares).  

(b)   De minimis Adjustments  . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment under this Section 8 need be made to the Conversion Price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any lesser  

40 

adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment, if any, which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall result in an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of such Conversion Price. No adjustment under this Section 8 shall be made if such adjustment will result in a Conversion Price that is less than the par value of the Common Stock.  

(c)   Tax-Related Adjustments  . The Company may make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by this Section 8, as the Board of Directors considers advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. In the event the Company elects to make such a reduction in the Conversion Price, the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder if and to the extent that such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the reduction in the Conversion Price.  

(d)   Stockholder Rights Plans  . Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent that the Holders receive Common Stock, such Holders shall receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights issued under any future stockholder rights plan the Company may establish whether or not such rights are separated from the Common Stock prior to conversion. A distribution of rights pursuant to any stockholder rights plan will not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii) or 7(a)(iv),   provided   that the Company has provided for the Holders to receive such rights upon conversion.  

(e)   Notice of Adjustment  . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted in accordance with this Section 8, the Company shall (i) compute the Conversion Price in accordance with this Section 8 and prepare and transmit to the Transfer Agent an Officer s Certificate setting forth the Conversion Price, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based and (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 8 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, the Transfer Agent shall provide a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event and a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to the Conversion Price was determined and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price.  

(f)   Reversal of Adjustment  . If the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter (and before the dividend or distribution has been paid or delivered to stockholders) legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Price then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.  

(g)   Exceptions to Adjustment  . The applicable Conversion Price shall not be adjusted:  

(i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company s securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any such plan;  

(ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, the Holders shall become entitled upon conversion to any securities other than, or in addition to, shares of Common Stock, thereafter the number or amount of such other securities so receivable upon conversion shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Common Stock set forth in this Certificate of Designations.  

Section 10.   Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets  . 

(a) The Company, without the consent of the Holders, may consolidate with or merge into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to any Person or may permit any Person to consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all its properties to, the Company (any of the foregoing,    Reorganization   );   provided  ,    however  , that the shares of Series A Preferred Stock will become the kind and amount of securities of such successor, transferee or lessee, cash and other property receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible immediately prior to such Reorganization, having in respect of such successor, transferee or lessee the same power, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon.

42 

Section 11.   Notices  . 

(a) When the Company is required, pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, to give notice to Holders by issuing a press release, rather than directly to Holders, the Company shall do so in a public medium that is customary for such press release.

indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses, or (b) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person or (c) in the reasonable judgment of any such Person, based upon written advice of its counsel, a conflict of interest exists between such Person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such Person); and   provided  ,    further  , that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure to give notice shall materially adversely affect the indemnifying party in the defense of any such claim or litigation.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for fees or expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all such indemnified parties.  No indemnifying party will, except with the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation and, in the event an indemnified party controls the defense of any claim under this Section 8.3, such indemnified party may not settle such claim without the Company s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.

9.12       Independent Nature of Investors  Obligations and Rights  .  The obligations of each Investor under any Transaction Document are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Investor, and no Investor shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other Investor under any Transaction Document.  The decision of each Investor to purchase Securities pursuant to the Transaction Documents has been made by such Investor independently of any other Investor.  Nothing contained herein or in any Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Investor pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Investors as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Investors are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.  Each Investor acknowledges that no other Investor has acted as agent for such Investor in connection with making its investment hereunder and that no Investor will be acting as agent of such  

27 

Investor in connection with monitoring its investment in the Securities or enforcing its rights under the Transaction Documents.  Each Investor shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Investor to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.  The Company acknowledges that each of the Investors and the Other Existing Investors has been provided with the same transaction documents for the purpose of closing a transaction with multiple Persons and not because it was required or requested to do so by any Person. 

9.13       Reliance by and Exculpation of Agents  .   

(a)          Each Investor agrees and acknowledges that (i) none of the Agents has made, or will make, any representations or warranties with respect to the Company or the offer and sale of the Shares, and such Investor will not rely on any statements made by any Agent, orally or in writing, to the contrary; (ii) it will be responsible for conducting its own due diligence investigation with respect to the Company and the offer and sale of the Shares, (iii) it will be purchasing Shares based on the results of its own due diligence investigation of the Company, (iv) it has negotiated the offer and sale of the Shares directly with the Company, and the Agents will not be responsible for the ultimate success of any such investment and (v) the decision to invest in the Company will involve a significant degree of risk, including a risk of total loss of such investment.  Each Investor further represents and warrants to each Agent that it, including any fund or funds that it manages or advises that participates in the offer and sale of the Shares, is permitted under its constitutive documents (including, without limitation, all limited partnership agreements, charters, bylaws, limited liability company agreements, all applicable side letters with investors, and similar documents) to make investments of the type contemplated by this Agreement.  In light of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Investor releases each Agent, its employees, officers, representatives and Affiliates from any liability with respect to such Investor s participation in the offer and sale of the Shares including, but not limited to, any improper payment made in accordance with the information provided by the Company. This Section 9.13 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  The Agents have introduced each Investor to the Company in reliance on the Investor s understanding and agreement to this Section 9.13. 

(b)          The parties agree and acknowledge that each Agent may rely on the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement and may rely on the representations and warranties of the respective Investors contained in this Agreement as if such representations, warranties, agreements and covenants, as applicable, were made directly to such Agent.  The parties further agree each Agent may rely on the legal opinions to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.1(i) hereof. 

(c)          Each Investor agrees, for the express benefit of the Agents, that: no Agent, nor any of its Affiliates or any of its representatives (1) has any duties or obligations with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby other than those specifically set forth herein or in the engagement letter, to be entered into between the Company and the Agents; (2) shall be liable for any improper payment made in accordance with the information provided by the Company; (3) makes any representation or warranty, or has any responsibilities as to the validity, accuracy, value or genuineness of any information, certificates or documentation delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents; or (4) shall be liable to such Investor (x) for any action taken, suffered or omitted by any of them in good faith and reasonably believed to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Agreement or any Transaction Document or (y) for anything which any of them may do or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement or any Transaction Document, except for such Agent s own gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith.  Jefferies, its Affiliates and  

28 

its representatives shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Company for acting as placement agent hereunder pursuant the indemnification provisions set forth in the Engagement Letter. 

9.14        Non-Recourse  . All actions, obligations, losses or causes of action (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to (a) this Agreement and/or any other Transaction Document, (b) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and/or any other Transaction Document, (c) any breach or violation of this Agreement and/or any other Transaction Document and (d) any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby or in the other Transaction Documents to be consummated, in each case, may only be made against (and are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly named as parties hereto or thereto to the extent set forth herein and therein. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or otherwise to the contrary, each party covenants, agrees and acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and its and their respective representatives, that no recourse under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall be had against (i) any past, present or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited partner, stockholder, incorporator, representative or assignee of any party hereto or thereto (unless such Person is also a party) or (ii) any past, present or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited partner, stockholder, incorporator, representative or assignee of any of the foregoing (unless such Person is also a party), and none of the foregoing shall have any liability hereunder or thereunder (in each case, whether in tort, contract or otherwise), it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability or losses whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any of the aforementioned, as such, arising out of, in connection with or related in any manner to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (a) through (d).

CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS

CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS OF RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES OF 

SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK OF 

GENCO SHIPPING   TRADING LIMITED 

The undersigned, John C. Wobensmith, does hereby certify:  

1.        That he is the duly elected and acting President and Secretary of Genco Shipping   Trading Limited a Marshall Islands corporation (the    Company   ).  

2.        That pursuant to the authority conferred by the Company s Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, the Company s Board of Directors on [__________], 2016 adopted the following resolution designating and prescribing the relative rights, preferences and limitations of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock:  

RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors (the    Board   ) of the Company by the Articles of Incorporation, the Board does hereby establish a series of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, and the designation and certain powers, preferences and other special rights of the shares of such series, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, are hereby fixed as follows: 

Section 1.   Designation and Amount  .  The shares of such series shall be designated as    Series A Preferred Stock   .  The  Series A Preferred Stock shall have a par value of $0.01 per share, and the number of shares constituting such series shall initially be 27,061,856, which number the Board may from time to time increase or decrease (but not below the number then outstanding).  The Series A Preferred Stock shall have a liquidation preference of $4.85 per share (the    Liquidation Preference   ). 

Section 2.   Ranking  .  The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company, (a) senior to the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the    Common Stock   ), whether now outstanding or hereafter issued, and to each other class or series of stock of the Company (including any series of preferred stock established after [___________], 2016 (the    Issue Date   ) by the Board of Directors) the terms of which do not expressly provide that such class or series ranks senior to, or   pari     passu,   with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as    Junior Stock   ); (b)   pari     passu   with each other class or series of stock of the Company established after the Issue Date by the Board of Directors the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series ranks   pari     passu    with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as    Parity Stock   ); and (c) junior to each other class or series of stock of the Company established after the Issue Date by the Board of Directors the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series ranks senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as    Senior Stock   ). The Company s ability to issue Capital Stock that ranks   pari passu   with or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.  

Section 3.    Dividends  .  (a) Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock payable semiannually, which dividends shall be declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of the assets of the Company legally available therefor, and shall be payable semiannually commencing on the 180th day following the Issue Date (or the following Business Day if any such payment date is not a Business Day) (each such date being referred to herein as a    Dividend Payment Date   ) at the rate per annum of 6% per share on the Liquidation Preference;   provided   that, in the event that on any Dividend Payment Date, the 

34 

Company is not permitted to declare or pay such dividend or incur such liability either (x) as a matter of law or (y) under the terms of any loan agreement, credit agreement, guaranty, or related agreement, such dividend (a    Deferred Dividend   ) shall not be declared by the Board of Directors, shall not be paid or payable on such Dividend Payment Date and no liability shall be incurred in respect thereof, and instead, such Deferred Dividend shall be declared, become payable and be paid and the liability in respect thereof be incurred on the first succeeding Dividend Payment Date on which the Company is not prohibited from declaring, paying and incurring the liability in respect of such Deferred Dividend (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Deferred Dividend shall be payable in addition to, and not in lieu of, any dividend which would ordinarily be payable on such succeeding Dividend Payment Date). The amount of dividends payable for any other period that is shorter or longer than a full semiannual dividend period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. 

Commencing on and following the Meeting End Date, in the event that dividends are paid on shares of Common Stock in any dividend period with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, then a dividend shall be payable in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock for such period in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount otherwise payable in respect of such share of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the foregoing paragraph and (ii) the product of (A) the aggregate dividends payable per share of Common Stock in such dividend period times (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible.  

For purposes of this Section 3(a), a dividend period with respect to a Dividend Payment Date is the period commencing on the preceding Dividend Payment Date (or, if there is no preceding Dividend Payment Date, the Issue Date) and ending on the day immediately prior to the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends payable on a Dividend Payment Date shall be payable to Holders of record on the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof declares the dividend payable (each, a    Dividend Record Date   ).  

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3(a) to the contrary, and without limiting any other remedy available to the Company or any other party, dividends shall not accrue or be payable in respect of shares initially issued any Holder who is contractually obligated to appear and vote in favor of any proposal made at a meeting of stockholders of the Company in order to effect the Stockholder Approval (or whose transferor Holder was so obligated) if such Holder (or such transferor Holder or the Affiliates of either) fails so to appear and vote in favor.  Any shares issued to such Holders shall bear the Stockholder Approval Legend. 

(b)   Payment of Dividends  . The Company may make each dividend payment on the Series A Preferred Stock either (i) in cash (or, if applicable, in the same form as such dividend is paid to holders of Common Stock) or (ii) at the Company s option, by the issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including fractional shares) having an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the amount of the dividend to be paid (or, in the case of a non-cash distribution, having an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the fair market value of such dividend (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution)). Each fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall be entitled to a ratably proportionate amount of all dividends accumulating with respect to each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3, and all such dividends with respect to such outstanding fractional shares shall accumulate (whether or not declared) and shall be payable in the same manner and at such times as provided for in Section 3 with respect to dividends on each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock. No interest or sum of money in lieu of interest shall be payable in respect of any dividends or payment that may be in arrears.  

(c)   Payment Restrictions  . No dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior  

35 

Stock (in the case of Junior Stock) and other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) may be declared, made or paid, or set apart for payment upon, any Parity Stock or Junior Stock, nor may any Parity Stock or Junior Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any money paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any Parity Stock or Junior Stock) by or on behalf of the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior Stock (in the case of Junior Stock)), unless all accrued and unpaid dividends shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid (in cash or in kind), or are declared and a sum of cash sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for such payment, on the Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of such declaration, payment, redemption, purchase or acquisition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if full dividends have not been paid on the Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, dividends may be declared and paid on the Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock so long as the dividends are declared and paid   pro     rata   so that the aggregate amounts of dividends declared per share on, and the amounts of such dividends declared in cash or in kind, as applicable, per share on, the Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued and unpaid dividends per share on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and such other Parity Stock bear to each other.  

Section 4.   Liquidation Preference  . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, each Holder shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders of the Company, before any distribution of assets is made on the Common Stock or any other Junior Stock, an amount equal to the greater of (i) the aggregate Liquidation Preference attributable to shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15(a), plus an amount equal to the sum of all accrued and unpaid cumulative dividends, and (ii) the product of (x) the amount per share that would have been payable upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up to the holders of shares of Common Stock or such other class or series of securities into which the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible (assuming the conversion of each share of Series A Preferred Stock), multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock or such other securities into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder are then convertible.  

None of (i) the sale of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Company (other than in connection with the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company), (ii) the merger, conversion or consolidation of the Company into or with any other Person or (iii) the merger, conversion or consolidation of any other Person into or with the Company, shall constitute a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company for the purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph.  

In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to Holders upon any liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such Holders are entitled pursuant to this Section 4, no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of Parity Stock upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up unless proportionate distributable amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which Holders and holders of any Parity Stock are entitled upon such liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, with the amount allocable to each series of such stock determined on a   pro rata   basis of the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of each series and accrued and unpaid dividends to which each series is entitled.  

After the payment to the Holders of the full preferential amounts provided for above, the Holders as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.  

36 

Section 5.   Voting Rights  . 

(a) The Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights, including the right to elect any directors, except (i) voting rights, if any, required by law, and (ii) voting rights, if any, described in this Section 5.   

(b) So long as any Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, in addition to any other vote of stockholders of the Company required under applicable law or the Articles of Incorporation, the affirmative vote or consent of  the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, will be required (i) for any amendment of the Articles of Incorporation if the amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Holders so as to affect them adversely, (ii) to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase, any Parity Stock or Senior Stock, or (iii) to reclassify any authorized stock of the Company into any Parity Stock or Senior Stock, or any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase any Parity Stock or Senior Stock. No such vote shall be required for the Company to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase, any Junior Stock.  

Section 6.   Conversion  .   

(a)   Mandatory Conversion  . Effective as of the close of business on the Stockholder Approval Date, with respect to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock of a Holder, such Holder s shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically, without any action of such Holder, convert into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate Liquidation Preference of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock   divided by   the Conversion Price then in effect (such quotient, the    Conversion Shares   ).  

(b) In addition, effective as of the close of business on the Stockholder Approval Date, a Holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, at the election of the Company, either (i) cash in an amount equal to the then unpaid Deferred Dividends in respect of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder or (ii) a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the amount of any then unpaid Deferred Dividends in respect of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder   divided by   the Conversion Price then in effect (such quotient, the    Dividend Shares   ).  

No Holder may convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock other than pursuant to Section 6(a).  

(c)   Conversion Procedures  .   

(i) In the event of conversion pursuant to Section 6(a), the Company shall deliver as promptly as practicable written notice to each holder specifying: (A) the Stockholder Approval Date; (B) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock that is converted; (C) the place or places where certificates or evidence of book-entry notation for such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for issuance of certificates or evidence of book-entry notation representing shares of Common Stock; and (D) that dividends on the shares to be converted will cease to accrue on such Stockholder Approval Date. Unless the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion are to be issued in the same name as the name in which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are registered, each share surrendered for mandatory conversion shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the holder thereof or such holder s duly authorized attorney and an amount sufficient to pay any transfer or similar tax in accordance with Section 15(f).  

37 

(ii) The conversion shall be deemed to have been effected at the close of business on the Stockholder Approval Date. At such time: (A) the person in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such mandatory conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby at such time; (B) such shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of a holder with respect to such shares shall immediately terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock and other amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6 and the right to receive any dividend declared but not yet paid pursuant to Section 3.  

(iii) Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the mandatory conversion thereof following such Dividend Record Date and prior to such Dividend Payment Date. In such event, any such dividend that would otherwise be payable in the form of Series A Preferred Stock shall be payable to such Holder either (i) in cash or (ii) at the Company s option, in shares of Common Stock converted at the Conversion Price in effect as of the time of such mandatory conversion.  

(iv) In connection with the mandatory conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, no fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the Company shall pay an amount of cash in respect of such fractional interest equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Stockholder Approval Date.  

Section 7.   Settlement upon Conversion  . The Company shall satisfy its obligation to deliver Conversion Shares and, if applicable, Dividend Shares (or such other class or series of securities into which the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible) upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock by delivering to each Holder surrendering shares of Series A Preferred Stock for conversion a number of shares of Common Stock (or such other class or series of securities into which the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible) equal to the number of Conversion Shares and, if applicable, Dividend Shares to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 6 (  provided   that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares), as soon as practicable after the third Trading Day (but in no event later than the fifth Business Day) following the Stockholder Approval Date. In the event the Company elects to pay cash pursuant to Section 6(b)(i), such cash payment shall be made on the same date.  

Section 8.   Anti-dilution Adjustments  . 

(a) The Conversion Price shall be subject to the following adjustments from time to time:  

(i)   Stock Dividends  . In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in Common Stock, the Conversion Price, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination;   provided  ,    however  , that no such adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution pursuant to Section 3.  

(ii)   Stock Purchase Rights  . In case the Company shall issue to all holders of its Common Stock options, warrants or other rights entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares  

38 

of Common Stock for a period expiring within 60 days from the date of issuance of such options, warrants or other rights at a price per share of Common Stock less than 95% of the Market Value on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such options, warrants or other rights (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment, share purchase or similar plan), the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination   plus   the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration expected to be received by the Company upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such options, warrants or other rights (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) would purchase at such Market Value and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination   plus   the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, either directly or indirectly, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination;   provided  ,    however  , that no such adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such options, warrants or other rights pursuant to Section    provided  ,    further  ,    however  , that if any of the foregoing options, warrants or other rights are only exercisable upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, then the Conversion Price will not be adjusted until such Triggering Event occurs.  

(iii)   Stock Splits, Reverse Splits and Combinations  . In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided, split or reclassified into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or reclassified into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split, reclassification or combination becomes effective.  

(iv)   Debt, Asset or Security Distributions  . 

(A) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, assets or securities (but excluding any dividend or distribution of options, warrants or other rights referred to in paragraph (ii) of this Section 8(a), any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, any dividend or distribution of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-off referred to in the next subparagraph, or any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (i) of this Section 8(a)), the Conversion Price shall be reduced by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Market Value on the date fixed for such determination minus the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be the Market Value on the date fixed for such determination, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior  

39 

to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this subparagraph (iv)(A) is applicable, subparagraph (iv)(B) of this Section 8(a) shall not be applicable. No adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 3.  

(B) In the case of a Spin-off, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution shall be reduced by multiplying the Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Market Value on the date fixed for such determination   minus   the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the shares (or fractions thereof) of Capital Stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be the Market Value. Any adjustment to the Conversion Price under this subparagraph (iv)(B) will occur on the date that is the earlier of (1) the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-off and (2) the date of the Initial Public Offering of the securities being distributed in the Spin-off, if that Initial Public Offering is effected simultaneously with the Spin-off. No adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 3.  

(v)   Tender Offers  . In the case that a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of the Company (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares) of aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) per share of Common Stock that exceeds the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, then, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the last time (the    Expiration Time   ) tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof), the Conversion Price shall be reduced by multiplying the Conversion Price immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Market Value on the date of the Expiration Time and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the Expiration Time, and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Market Value on the date of the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered or exchanged, not withdrawn and accepted for payment on the date of the Expiration Time (such validly tendered or exchanged shares, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the    Purchased Shares   )   plus   (y) the amount of cash   plus   the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of the Company pursuant to the tender or exchange offer (assuming the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares).  

(b)   De minimis Adjustments  . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment under this Section 8 need be made to the Conversion Price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any lesser  

40 

adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment, if any, which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall result in an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of such Conversion Price. No adjustment under this Section 8 shall be made if such adjustment will result in a Conversion Price that is less than the par value of the Common Stock.  

(c)   Tax-Related Adjustments  . The Company may make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by this Section 8, as the Board of Directors considers advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. In the event the Company elects to make such a reduction in the Conversion Price, the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder if and to the extent that such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the reduction in the Conversion Price.  

(d)   Stockholder Rights Plans  . Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent that the Holders receive Common Stock, such Holders shall receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights issued under any future stockholder rights plan the Company may establish whether or not such rights are separated from the Common Stock prior to conversion. A distribution of rights pursuant to any stockholder rights plan will not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii) or 7(a)(iv),   provided   that the Company has provided for the Holders to receive such rights upon conversion.  

(e)   Notice of Adjustment  . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted in accordance with this Section 8, the Company shall (i) compute the Conversion Price in accordance with this Section 8 and prepare and transmit to the Transfer Agent an Officer s Certificate setting forth the Conversion Price, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based and (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 8 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, the Transfer Agent shall provide a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event and a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to the Conversion Price was determined and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price.  

(f)   Reversal of Adjustment  . If the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter (and before the dividend or distribution has been paid or delivered to stockholders) legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Price then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.  

(g)   Exceptions to Adjustment  . The applicable Conversion Price shall not be adjusted:

In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, the Holders shall become entitled upon conversion to any securities other than, or in addition to, shares of Common Stock, thereafter the number or amount of such other securities so receivable upon conversion shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Common Stock set forth in this Certificate of Designations.

(i) Whenever possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision hereof is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating or otherwise adversely affecting the remaining provisions hereof. If a court of competent jurisdiction should determine that a provision hereof would be valid or enforceable if a period of time were extended or shortened or a particular percentage were increased or decreased, then such court may make such change as shall be necessary to render the provision in question effective and valid under applicable law.  

(j) Series A Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the Holder, in proportion to such Holder s fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and have the benefit of all other rights of Holders of Series A Preferred Stock.

(m) The headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of any of the provisions hereof.  

(n) If any of the voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof set forth herein is invalid, unlawful or incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule of law or public policy, all other voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of Series A Preferred Stock and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof set forth herein which can be given effect without the invalid, unlawful or unenforceable voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of Series A Preferred Stock and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof shall, nevertheless, remain in full force and effect, and no voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of Series A Preferred Stock and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof herein set forth shall be deemed dependent upon any other such voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of Series A Preferred Stock and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof unless so expressed herein.  

(o) Shares of Series A Preferred Stock that (i) have not been issued on or before the Issue Date or (ii) have been issued and reacquired in any manner, including shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased or converted, shall (upon compliance with any applicable provisions of Business Corporations Act of the Republic of the Marshall Islands) have the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock of the Company undesignated as to series and may be designated or redesignated and issued or reissued, as the case may be, as part of any series of preferred stock of the Company; provided that any issuance of such shares as Series A Preferred Stock must be in compliance with the terms hereof.  

(p) If any of the Series A Preferred Stock certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue, in exchange and in substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Series A Preferred Stock certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the Series A Preferred Stock certificate lost, stolen or destroyed, a new Series A Preferred Stock certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent amount of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, but only upon receipt of evidence of such loss, theft or destruction of such Series A Preferred Stock certificate and indemnity, if requested, reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Transfer Agent.

The Company covenants that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not modify, amend or withdraw either Company Board Recommendation unless the Board of Directors (after consultation with the Company s outside counsel) shall determine in the good faith exercise of its business judgment that maintaining such Company Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duty to the Company s stockholders. Whether or not the Company s Board of Directors modifies, amends or withdraws either Company Board Recommendation pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall in accordance with the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act and the provisions of its Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or its Amended and Restated Bylaws, (i) take all action reasonably necessary to convene the Stockholders Meeting and, if necessary, each Subsequent Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable, but no later than the Stockholders Meeting Deadline with respect to the Stockholders Meeting and as soon as practicable with respect to each Subsequent Stockholders Meeting, to consider and vote upon the approval of the Proposal and the Board Increase and (ii) submit the Proposal and the Board Increase at the Stockholders Meeting or, if applicable, each Subsequent Stockholders Meeting to the stockholders of the Company for their approval. 

(c)         From the date hereof until termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.3 hereof (the    Term   ), at the Stockholders Meeting and, if applicable, each Subsequent Stockholders Meeting, however called and at any adjournment or postponement thereof, and in any action by consent of the stockholders of the Company, each Investor and its Affiliates owning any shares of Common Stock shall (A) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause all shares of Common Stock held by it to be counted as present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum and (B) vote (or cause to be voted) all shares of Common Stock held by it in favor of the Proposal and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; provided that no Investor or its Affiliates shall be under any obligation hereunder with respect to any vote regarding the  

22 

Board Increase.  During the term of this Agreement, no such Investor or its Affiliates shall transfer any shares of Common Stock prior to shareholder approval of the Proposal unless the transferee has agreed for the benefit of the Company to be bound by the provisions of this Section 7.9(c). 

7.10       [Intentionally omitted]  .

7.12       Investor Director  . 

(a)        From and after the Closing until the conversion of the Shares, and thereafter and until the Investors no longer beneficially own (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) at least 12.5% of the total outstanding Common Stock at any time (the    Nomination Right Termination   ), at each annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which directors are to be elected to the Board of Directors, the Company (subject to applicable law, including any fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors) shall nominate and use its commercially reasonable efforts (which shall include inserting in any proxy statement used by the Company to solicit the vote of its stockholders in connection with any such meeting the recommendation of the Board of Directors that stockholders of the Company vote in favor of each Investor Designee (defined below)) to cause the election to the Board of Directors of a slate of directors that includes one (1) individual designated in writing by the Investors for nomination for election or for appointment to the Board of Directors and approved by the Board of Directors or any responsible committee thereof (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) (any such individual being an    Investor Designee   ); except that if the Investors beneficially own at least 25% of the total outstanding Common Stock and the size of the Board has been increased to nine (9) members, the number of Investor Designees that the Investors shall be entitled to designate shall be two (2).  To the extent that the Company s Board of Directors or any responsible committee thereof views it as necessary or desirable that any second Investor Designee of the Investors be independent under the applicable rules of any exchange on which the Company s capital stock is listed or for regulatory compliance purposes, the Investors shall comply with the request of the Company to designate a second Investor Designee that would be independent under such rules or regulations or, if such second Investor Designee has already been elected or appointed to the Company s Board of Directors (an    Investor Director   ), shall secure the resignation of such Investor Director and designate an Investor Designee who would be independent under such rules or regulations.   

(b)        The Investors shall notify the Company of the identity of any proposed Investor Designee, in writing, at or before the time such information is reasonably requested by the Board of Directors or any responsible committee thereof for inclusion in a proxy statement for a meeting of stockholders, and shall promptly furnish in writing all information about the Investors and such proposed Investor Designee as shall be reasonably requested by the Board of Directors or any responsible committee thereof (including, at a minimum, any information regarding such proposed Investor Designee to the extent required by applicable securities laws or for any other person nominated for election to the Board of Directors). 

23 

(c)         Until the Nomination Right Termination and subject to Sections 7.11(a) and (b), in the event of (i) the death, disability, removal or resignation of an Investor Director, the Board of Directors (subject to applicable law, including any fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors) shall promptly appoint as a replacement Investor Director the Investor Designee designated by the Investors to fill the resulting vacancy, or (ii) the failure of an Investor Designee to be elected to the Board of Directors at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which such Investor Designee stood for election but was nevertheless not elected (such Investor Designee, an    Investor Specified Designee   ), the Board of Directors (subject to applicable law, including any fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors) shall promptly appoint another Investor Designee designated by the Investors to serve in lieu of such Investor Specified Designee as an Investor Director during the term that such Investor Specified Designee would have served had such Investor Specified Designee been elected at such meeting of the stockholders of the Company, and, in each case of clause (i) and clause (ii), such individual shall then be deemed an Investor Director for all purposes hereunder. 

(d)         The Company shall at all times provide each Investor Director (in his or her capacity as a member of the Board of Directors) with the same rights to indemnification and exculpation that it provides to the other members of the Board of Directors.  The Company acknowledges and agrees that any such obligations to indemnify or advance expenses to each Investor Director, in his or her capacity as such, for the matters covered by such obligations, shall be the primary source of indemnification and advancement of such Investor Director in connection therewith, and any obligation on the part of any Investor under any indemnification agreement to indemnify or advance expenses to such Investor Director shall be secondary to the Company s obligation and shall be reduced by any amount that such Investor Director may collect as indemnification or advancement from the Company.  In the event that the Company fails to indemnify or advance expenses to such Investor Director as required by such indemnification obligations and this Agreement (such unpaid amounts, the    Unpaid Indemnitee Amounts   ), and any Investor makes any payment to such Investor Director in respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses on account of such Unpaid Indemnitee Amounts, such Investor shall be subrogated to the rights of such Investor Director under this Agreement in respect of such Unpaid Indemnitee Amounts. 

(e)         The initial Investor Director shall be Arthur L. Regan. 

8.            Survival and Indemnification  . 

8.1        Survival  .  The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

8.2        Indemnification  .  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Investor and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, trustees, members, managers, employees and agents, and their respective successors and assigns, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorney fees and disbursements and other expenses incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any action, claim or proceeding, pending or threatened and the costs of enforcement thereof) (collectively,    Losses   ) to which such Person may become subject as a result of any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by or to be performed on the part of the Company under the Transaction Documents. 

8.3        Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings  .  Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks 

24 

indemnification and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party;   provided   that any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (a) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses, or (b) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person or (c) in the reasonable judgment of any such Person, based upon written advice of its counsel, a conflict of interest exists between such Person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such Person); and   provided  ,    further  , that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure to give notice shall materially adversely affect the indemnifying party in the defense of any such claim or litigation.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for fees or expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all such indemnified parties.  No indemnifying party will, except with the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation and, in the event an indemnified party controls the defense of any claim under this Section 8.3, such indemnified party may not settle such claim without the Company s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. 

9.            Miscellaneous  . 

9.1        Successors and Assigns  .

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York without regard to the choice of law principles thereof.

Nothing contained herein or in any Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Investor  

27 

pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Investors as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Investors are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.  Each Investor acknowledges that no other Investor has acted as agent for such Investor in connection with making its investment hereunder and that no Investor will be acting as agent of such Investor in connection with monitoring its investment in the Securities or enforcing its rights under the Transaction Documents.  Each Investor shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Investor to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

Each Investor further represents and warrants to each Agent that it, including any fund or funds that it manages or advises that participates in the offer and sale of the Shares, is permitted under its constitutive documents (including, without limitation, all limited partnership agreements, charters, bylaws, limited liability company agreements, all applicable side letters with investors, and similar documents) to make investments of the type contemplated by this Agreement.  In light of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Investor releases each Agent, its employees, officers, representatives and Affiliates from any liability with respect to such Investor s participation in the offer and sale of the Shares including, but not limited to, any improper payment made in accordance with the information provided by the Company. This Section 9.13 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  The Agents have introduced each Investor to the Company in reliance on the Investor s understanding and agreement to this Section 9.13. 

(b)         The parties agree and acknowledge that each Agent may rely on the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement and may rely on the representations and warranties of the respective Investors contained in this Agreement as if such representations, warranties, agreements and covenants, as applicable, were made directly to such Agent.  The parties further agree each Agent may rely on the legal opinions to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.1(i) hereof. 

(c)         Each Investor agrees, for the express benefit of the Agents, that: no Agent, nor any of its Affiliates or any of its representatives (1) has any duties or obligations with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby other than those specifically set forth herein or in the engagement letter, to be entered into between the Company and the Agents; (2) shall be liable for any improper payment made in accordance with the information provided by the Company; (3) makes any representation or warranty, or has any responsibilities as to the validity, accuracy, value or genuineness of any information, certificates or documentation delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement or the  

28 

Transaction Documents; or (4) shall be liable to such Investor (x) for any action taken, suffered or omitted by any of them in good faith and reasonably believed to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Agreement or any Transaction Document or (y) for anything which any of them may do or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement or any Transaction Document, except for such Agent s own gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith.  Jefferies, its Affiliates and its representatives shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Company for acting as placement agent hereunder pursuant the indemnification provisions set forth in the Engagement Letter. 

9.14        Non-Recourse  . All actions, obligations, losses or causes of action (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to (a) this Agreement and/or any other Transaction Document, (b) the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and/or any other Transaction Document, (c) any breach or violation of this Agreement and/or any other Transaction Document and (d) any failure of the transactions contemplated hereby or in the other Transaction Documents to be consummated, in each case, may only be made against (and are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly named as parties hereto or thereto to the extent set forth herein and therein. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or otherwise to the contrary, each party covenants, agrees and acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and its and their respective representatives, that no recourse under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall be had against (i) any past, present or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited partner, stockholder, incorporator, representative or assignee of any party hereto or thereto (unless such Person is also a party) or (ii) any past, present or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited partner, stockholder, incorporator, representative or assignee of any of the foregoing (unless such Person is also a party), and none of the foregoing shall have any liability hereunder or thereunder (in each case, whether in tort, contract or otherwise), it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability or losses whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any of the aforementioned, as such, arising out of, in connection with or related in any manner to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (a) through (d).

The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company, (a) senior to the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the    Common Stock   ), whether now outstanding or hereafter issued, and to each other class or series of stock of the Company (including any series of preferred stock established after [___________], 2016 (the    Issue Date   ) by the Board of Directors) the terms of which do not expressly provide that such class or series ranks senior to, or   pari     passu,   with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as    Junior Stock   ); (b)   pari     passu   with each other class or series of stock of the Company established after the Issue Date by the Board of Directors the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series ranks   pari     passu   with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as    Parity Stock   ); and (c) junior to each other class or series of stock of the Company established after the Issue Date by the Board of Directors the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series ranks senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as    Senior Stock   ). The Company s ability to issue Capital Stock that ranks   pari passu   with or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.  

Section 3.   Dividends  .  (a) Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock payable semiannually, which dividends shall be declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of the assets of the Company legally available therefor, and shall be payable semiannually commencing on the 180th day following the Issue Date (or the following Business Day if any such payment date is not a Business Day) (each such date being referred to herein as a    Dividend Payment Date   ) at the rate per annum of 6% per share on the Liquidation Preference;   provided   that, in the event that on any Dividend Payment Date, the 

35 

Company is not permitted to declare or pay such dividend or incur such liability either (x) as a matter of law or (y) under the terms of any loan agreement, credit agreement, guaranty, or related agreement, such dividend (a    Deferred Dividend   ) shall not be declared by the Board of Directors, shall not be paid or payable on such Dividend Payment Date and no liability shall be incurred in respect thereof, and instead, such Deferred Dividend shall be declared, become payable and be paid and the liability in respect thereof be incurred on the first succeeding Dividend Payment Date on which the Company is not prohibited from declaring, paying and incurring the liability in respect of such Deferred Dividend (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Deferred Dividend shall be payable in addition to, and not in lieu of, any dividend which would ordinarily be payable on such succeeding Dividend Payment Date). The amount of dividends payable for any other period that is shorter or longer than a full semiannual dividend period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. 

Commencing on and following the Meeting End Date, in the event that dividends are paid on shares of Common Stock in any dividend period with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, then a dividend shall be payable in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock for such period in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount otherwise payable in respect of such share of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the foregoing paragraph and (ii) the product of (A) the aggregate dividends payable per share of Common Stock in such dividend period times (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible.  

For purposes of this Section 3(a), a dividend period with respect to a Dividend Payment Date is the period commencing on the preceding Dividend Payment Date (or, if there is no preceding Dividend Payment Date, the Issue Date) and ending on the day immediately prior to the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends payable on a Dividend Payment Date shall be payable to Holders of record on the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof declares the dividend payable (each, a    Dividend Record Date   ).  

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3(a) to the contrary, and without limiting any other remedy available to the Company or any other party, dividends shall not accrue or be payable in respect of shares initially issued any Holder who is contractually obligated to appear and vote in favor of any proposal made at a meeting of stockholders of the Company in order to effect the Stockholder Approval (or whose transferor Holder was so obligated) if such Holder (or such transferor Holder or the Affiliates of either) fails so to appear and vote in favor.  Any shares issued to such Holders shall bear the Stockholder Approval Legend. 

(b)   Payment of Dividends  . The Company may make each dividend payment on the Series A Preferred Stock either (i) in cash (or, if applicable, in the same form as such dividend is paid to holders of Common Stock) or (ii) at the Company s option, by the issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including fractional shares) having an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the amount of the dividend to be paid (or, in the case of a non-cash distribution, having an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the fair market value of such dividend (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution)). Each fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall be entitled to a ratably proportionate amount of all dividends accumulating with respect to each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3, and all such dividends with respect to such outstanding fractional shares shall accumulate (whether or not declared) and shall be payable in the same manner and at such times as provided for in Section 3 with respect to dividends on each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock. No interest or sum of money in lieu of interest shall be payable in respect of any dividends or payment that may be in arrears.  

(c)   Payment Restrictions  . No dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior  

36 

Stock (in the case of Junior Stock) and other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) may be declared, made or paid, or set apart for payment upon, any Parity Stock or Junior Stock, nor may any Parity Stock or Junior Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any money paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any Parity Stock or Junior Stock) by or on behalf of the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior Stock (in the case of Junior Stock)), unless all accrued and unpaid dividends shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid (in cash or in kind), or are declared and a sum of cash sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for such payment, on the Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of such declaration, payment, redemption, purchase or acquisition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if full dividends have not been paid on the Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, dividends may be declared and paid on the Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock so long as the dividends are declared and paid   pro     rata   so that the aggregate amounts of dividends declared per share on, and the amounts of such dividends declared in cash or in kind, as applicable, per share on, the Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued and unpaid dividends per share on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and such other Parity Stock bear to each other.  

Section 4.   Liquidation Preference  . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, each Holder shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders of the Company, before any distribution of assets is made on the Common Stock or any other Junior Stock, an amount equal to the greater of (i) the aggregate Liquidation Preference attributable to shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15(a), plus an amount equal to the sum of all accrued and unpaid cumulative dividends, and (ii) the product of (x) the amount per share that would have been payable upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up to the holders of shares of Common Stock or such other class or series of securities into which the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible (assuming the conversion of each share of Series A Preferred Stock), multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock or such other securities into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder are then convertible.  

None of (i) the sale of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Company (other than in connection with the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company), (ii) the merger, conversion or consolidation of the Company into or with any other Person or (iii) the merger, conversion or consolidation of any other Person into or with the Company, shall constitute a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company for the purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph.  

In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to Holders upon any liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such Holders are entitled pursuant to this Section 4, no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of Parity Stock upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up unless proportionate distributable amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which Holders and holders of any Parity Stock are entitled upon such liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, with the amount allocable to each series of such stock determined on a   pro rata   basis of the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of each series and accrued and unpaid dividends to which each series is entitled.  

After the payment to the Holders of the full preferential amounts provided for above, the Holders as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.  

37 

Section 5.   Voting Rights  . 

(a) The Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights, including the right to elect any directors, except (i) voting rights, if any, required by law, and (ii) voting rights, if any, described in this Section 5.  

(b) So long as any Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, in addition to any other vote of stockholders of the Company required under applicable law or the Articles of Incorporation, the affirmative vote or consent of  the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, will be required (i) for any amendment of the Articles of Incorporation if the amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Holders so as to affect them adversely, (ii) to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase, any Parity Stock or Senior Stock, or (iii) to reclassify any authorized stock of the Company into any Parity Stock or Senior Stock, or any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase any Parity Stock or Senior Stock. No such vote shall be required for the Company to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase, any Junior Stock.  

Section 6.   Conversion  .   

(a)   Mandatory Conversion  . Effective as of the close of business on the Stockholder Approval Date, with respect to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock of a Holder, such Holder s shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically, without any action of such Holder, convert into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate Liquidation Preference of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock   divided by   the Conversion Price then in effect (such quotient, the    Conversion Shares   ).  

(b) In addition, effective as of the close of business on the Stockholder Approval Date, a Holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, at the election of the Company, either (i) cash in an amount equal to the then unpaid Deferred Dividends in respect of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder or (ii) a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the amount of any then unpaid Deferred Dividends in respect of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder   divided by   the Conversion Price then in effect (such quotient, the    Dividend Shares   ).  

No Holder may convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock other than pursuant to Section 6(a).  

(c)   Conversion Procedures  .   

(i) In the event of conversion pursuant to Section 6(a), the Company shall deliver as promptly as practicable written notice to each holder specifying: (A) the Stockholder Approval Date; (B) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock that is converted; (C) the place or places where certificates or evidence of book-entry notation for such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for issuance of certificates or evidence of book-entry notation representing shares of Common Stock; and (D) that dividends on the shares to be converted will cease to accrue on such Stockholder Approval Date. Unless the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion are to be issued in the same name as the name in which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are registered, each share surrendered for mandatory conversion shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the holder thereof or such holder s duly authorized attorney and an amount sufficient to pay any transfer or similar tax in accordance with Section 15(f).  

38 

(ii) The conversion shall be deemed to have been effected at the close of business on the Stockholder Approval Date. At such time: (A) the person in whose name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such mandatory conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby at such time; (B) such shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of a holder with respect to such shares shall immediately terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock and other amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6 and the right to receive any dividend declared but not yet paid pursuant to Section 3.  

(iii) Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the mandatory conversion thereof following such Dividend Record Date and prior to such Dividend Payment Date. In such event, any such dividend that would otherwise be payable in the form of Series A Preferred Stock shall be payable to such Holder either (i) in cash or (ii) at the Company s option, in shares of Common Stock converted at the Conversion Price in effect as of the time of such mandatory conversion.  

(iv) In connection with the mandatory conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, no fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the Company shall pay an amount of cash in respect of such fractional interest equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Stockholder Approval Date.  

Section 7.   Settlement upon Conversion  . The Company shall satisfy its obligation to deliver Conversion Shares and, if applicable, Dividend Shares (or such other class or series of securities into which the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible) upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock by delivering to each Holder surrendering shares of Series A Preferred Stock for conversion a number of shares of Common Stock (or such other class or series of securities into which the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible) equal to the number of Conversion Shares and, if applicable, Dividend Shares to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 6 (  provided   that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares), as soon as practicable after the third Trading Day (but in no event later than the fifth Business Day) following the Stockholder Approval Date. In the event the Company elects to pay cash pursuant to Section 6(b)(i), such cash payment shall be made on the same date.  

Section 8.   Anti-dilution Adjustments  . 

(a) The Conversion Price shall be subject to the following adjustments from time to time:  

(i)   Stock Dividends  . In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in Common Stock, the Conversion Price, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination;   provided  ,    however  , that no such adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution pursuant to Section 3.  

(ii)   Stock Purchase Rights  . In case the Company shall issue to all holders of its Common Stock options, warrants or other rights entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares  

39 

of Common Stock for a period expiring within 60 days from the date of issuance of such options, warrants or other rights at a price per share of Common Stock less than 95% of the Market Value on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such options, warrants or other rights (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment, share purchase or similar plan), the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination   plus   the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration expected to be received by the Company upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such options, warrants or other rights (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) would purchase at such Market Value and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination   plus   the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, either directly or indirectly, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination;   provided  ,    however  , that no such adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such options, warrants or other rights pursuant to Section    provided  ,    further  ,    however  , that if any of the foregoing options, warrants or other rights are only exercisable upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, then the Conversion Price will not be adjusted until such Triggering Event occurs.  

(iii)   Stock Splits, Reverse Splits and Combinations  . In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided, split or reclassified into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or reclassified into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split, reclassification or combination becomes effective.  

(iv)   Debt, Asset or Security Distributions  . 

(A) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, assets or securities (but excluding any dividend or distribution of options, warrants or other rights referred to in paragraph (ii) of this Section 8(a), any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, any dividend or distribution of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-off referred to in the next subparagraph, or any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (i) of this Section 8(a)), the Conversion Price shall be reduced by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Market Value on the date fixed for such determination minus the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be the Market Value on the date fixed for such determination, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior  

40 

to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this subparagraph (iv)(A) is applicable, subparagraph (iv)(B) of this Section 8(a) shall not be applicable. No adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 3.  

(B) In the case of a Spin-off, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution shall be reduced by multiplying the Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Market Value on the date fixed for such determination   minus   the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the shares (or fractions thereof) of Capital Stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be the Market Value. Any adjustment to the Conversion Price under this subparagraph (iv)(B) will occur on the date that is the earlier of (1) the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-off and (2) the date of the Initial Public Offering of the securities being distributed in the Spin-off, if that Initial Public Offering is effected simultaneously with the Spin-off. No adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 3.  

(v)   Tender Offers  . In the case that a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of the Company (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares) of aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) per share of Common Stock that exceeds the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, then, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the last time (the    Expiration Time   ) tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof), the Conversion Price shall be reduced by multiplying the Conversion Price immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Market Value on the date of the Expiration Time and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the Expiration Time, and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Market Value on the date of the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered or exchanged, not withdrawn and accepted for payment on the date of the Expiration Time (such validly tendered or exchanged shares, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the    Purchased Shares   )   plus   (y) the amount of cash   plus   the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of the Company pursuant to the tender or exchange offer (assuming the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares).  

(b)   De minimis Adjustments  . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment under this Section 8 need be made to the Conversion Price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any lesser  

41 

adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment, if any, which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall result in an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of such Conversion Price. No adjustment under this Section 8 shall be made if such adjustment will result in a Conversion Price that is less than the par value of the Common Stock.  

(c)   Tax-Related Adjustments  . The Company may make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by this Section 8, as the Board of Directors considers advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. In the event the Company elects to make such a reduction in the Conversion Price, the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder if and to the extent that such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the reduction in the Conversion Price.  

(d)   Stockholder Rights Plans  . Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent that the Holders receive Common Stock, such Holders shall receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights issued under any future stockholder rights plan the Company may establish whether or not such rights are separated from the Common Stock prior to conversion. A distribution of rights pursuant to any stockholder rights plan will not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii) or 7(a)(iv),   provided   that the Company has provided for the Holders to receive such rights upon conversion.  

(e)   Notice of Adjustment  . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted in accordance with this Section 8, the Company shall (i) compute the Conversion Price in accordance with this Section 8 and prepare and transmit to the Transfer Agent an Officer s Certificate setting forth the Conversion Price, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based and (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 8 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, the Transfer Agent shall provide a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event and a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to the Conversion Price was determined and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price.  

(f)   Reversal of Adjustment  . If the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter (and before the dividend or distribution has been paid or delivered to stockholders) legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Price then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.  

(g)   Exceptions to Adjustment  . The applicable Conversion Price shall not be adjusted:  

(i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company s securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any such plan;  

(ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;  

42 

(iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the Issue Date;  

(iv) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or any other security of the Company in connection with acquisitions of assets or securities of another Person, including with respect to any merger or consolidation or similar transaction;  

(v) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or  

(vi) for accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.  

Section 9.   Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changes in the Company s Stock  . In the event of any reclassification of outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or any sale or other disposition to another Person of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (computed on a consolidated basis) (any of the foregoing, a    Transaction   ), upon conversion of its shares of Series A Preferred Stock, a Holder will be entitled to receive the kind and amount of securities (of the Company or another issuer), cash and other property receivable upon such Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible immediately prior to such Transaction, after giving effect to any adjustment event or, in the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in any Transaction, the weighted average of the forms and amounts of consideration received by the holders of the Common Stock. In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, the Holders shall become entitled upon conversion to any securities other than, or in addition to, shares of Common Stock, thereafter the number or amount of such other securities so receivable upon conversion shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Common Stock set forth in this Certificate of Designations.  

Section 10.   Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets  . 

(a) The Company, without the consent of the Holders, may consolidate with or merge into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to any Person or may permit any Person to consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all its properties to, the Company (any of the foregoing,    Reorganization   );   provided  ,    however  , that the shares of Series A Preferred Stock will become the kind and amount of securities of such successor, transferee or lessee, cash and other property receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible immediately prior to such Reorganization, having in respect of such successor, transferee or lessee the same power, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon.  

(b) Upon any consolidation by the Company with, or merger by the Company into, any other Person or any conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all the assets of the Company as described in Section 10(a), the successor resulting from such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the transferee or lessee to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made, will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the predecessor (if still in existence) will be released from its obligations and covenants with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock.  

43 

Section 11.   Notices  . 

(a) When the Company is required, pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, to give notice to Holders by issuing a press release, rather than directly to Holders, the Company shall do so in a public medium that is customary for such press release.  In such cases, publication of a press release through GlobeNewswire, Inc. shall be considered sufficient to comply with such notice obligation.  

(b) When the Company is required, pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, to give notice to Holders without specifying the method of giving such notice, the Company shall do so by sending notice via first class mail or by overnight courier to the Holders of record as of a reasonably current date.  

Section 12.   Transfer of Securities  . 

(a) The shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock (collectively, the    Securities   ) have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and may not be offered or sold except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws, or pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws, or in a transaction not subject to such laws.

3.   Restrictive Covenants 

A.    Non-disclosure of Confidential Information  .  The Genco Group owns and has developed and compiled, and will own, develop and compile, certain techniques, information, and materials tangible or intangible, relating to itself, its customers, suppliers, vessels, shareholders, banks and others, which are secret, proprietary and confidential, and which have great value to its business (referred to in this Agreement, collectively, as    Confidential Information   ). Confidential Information shall not in any event include information which (i) was generally known or generally available to the public or within the relevant trade or industry prior to its disclosure to you or (ii) becomes generally known or generally available to the public or within the relevant trade or industry subsequent to disclosure to you other than due to your breach of your obligations.  Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, information contained in manuals, documents, computer programs, compilations of technical, financial, legal or other data, specifications, designs, business or marketing plans, forecasts, financial information, work in  

progress, and other technical or business information.        You acknowledge and agree that in the performance of your duties, the Genco Group from time to time disclosed to you and entrusted you with Confidential Information. You also acknowledge and agree that the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information obtained by you during your service, among other things, may be prejudicial to the interests of the Genco Group s interests and an improper disclosure of trade secrets. Unless the Company otherwise consents, you agree that following the Termination Date you shall not, except as otherwise provided herein, directly or indirectly, use, make available, sell, disclose or otherwise communicate to any corporation, partnership, individual or other third party any Confidential Information.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the provisions of this Section 3(A) shall not apply (x) when disclosure is required by law or by any court, arbitrator, mediator or administrative or legislative body (including any committee thereof) with actual or apparent jurisdiction to order you to disclose or make accessible any information or (y) to the extent reasonably necessary to enforce or defend your rights pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement between you and the Company (provided that in the case of clause (x), unless otherwise prohibited by law, you provide the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and reasonably cooperate with the Company at the Company s expense in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).  From and after the Termination Date, you shall not retain or take with you any Confidential Information in a Tangible Form (defined below), and you shall as promptly as possible deliver to the Company any Confidential Information in a Tangible Form that you then control, as well as all other Genco Group property, including equipment, documents or other things, that was issued to you or otherwise received or obtained during your service with the Company that you then control.    Tangible Form    includes information or materials in written or graphic form, on a computer disk or other medium, or otherwise stored in or available through electronic or other form.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, you shall be entitled to retain (i) papers and other materials of a personal nature, including, but not limited to, photographs, personal correspondence, personal diaries, personal calendars and Rolodexes, personal files and phone books, (ii) information showing your compensation or relating to reimbursement of expenses, (iii) information that you reasonably believe may be needed for tax purposes and (iv) copies of plans, programs relating to your service, or termination thereof, with the Company, provided that you shall provide the Company with a list and, to the extent related to the Genco Group s business, copies of the foregoing upon request (in which event the Company will keep your confidential personal information confidential in accordance with its customary business practice).    Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit or restrict you from responding to any inquiry, or otherwise communicating with, any federal, state or local administrative or regulatory agency or authority or participating in an investigation conducted by any governmental agency or authority.  You cannot be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of Confidential Information that: (1)  is made: (x) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (y) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.  As a result, you shall have the right to disclose Confidential Information in confidence to federal, state, and local government officials, or to an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law.   You also have the right to disclose Confidential Information in a document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, but only if the filing is made under seal and protected from public disclosure.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with that right

WHEREAS, the Former Director has resigned effective October 13, 2016; and 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Separation Agreement between the Former Director and the Company, dated October 13, 2016, (the    Separation Agreement   ) it is a condition precedent to the Company s obligations to make certain payments under Section 2 of the Separation Agreement and that Former Director executes and delivers this Agreement. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements contained herein and in the Separation Agreement, the sufficiency and receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Former Director agrees as follows: 

1.           General Release and Waiver of Claims  . 

(a)        In consideration for the benefits provided to Former Director under the Separation Agreement (the    Consideration   ), Former Director hereby releases and forever discharges and holds the Company, subsidiaries of the Company, affiliates of the Company and each officer, director, employee, partner (general and limited), equity holder, member, manager, agent, subsidiary, affiliate, successor and assign and insurer of any of the foregoing (collectively, the    Releasees   ) harmless from all claims or suits, of any nature whatsoever (whether known or unknown), being directly or indirectly related to Former Director s service with the Company or the termination thereof, including, but not limited to, any claims for notice, pay in lieu of notice, wrongful dismissal, discrimination, harassment, severance pay, bonus, incentive compensation, interest, any claims relating to Former Director s service as with the Company, through the date hereof.   

(b)        This release includes, but is not limited to, contract and tort claims, claims arising out of any legal restriction on the Company s right to terminate its employees and claims or rights under federal, state, and local laws prohibiting employment discrimination, including, but not limited to, claims or rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Civil Rights Act of 1991; the Equal Pay Act; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (   ADEA   ), including the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990; the Americans with Disabilities Act; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and any other federal, state, or local law (statutory or decisional), regulation or ordinance (if and to the extent applicable and as the same may be amended from time to time), or under any public policy, contract or tort, or under common law; or arising under any policies, practices or procedures of the Releasees; or any claim for wrongful discharge, breach of contract, infliction of emotional distress, defamation; or any claim for costs, fees,  

1 

or other expenses (including attorneys  fees incurred in these matters), which arose through the date Former Director executes this Agreement.  

(c)       Former Director acknowledges that the consideration given for this Agreement is in addition to anything of value to which Former Director was already entitled.   

(d)       Former Director acknowledges that because this Agreement contains a general release of all claims including under the ADEA, and is an important legal document, he has been advised to consult with legal counsel of his own choosing.

Further, the release contained herein does not, and shall not be construed to, release or limit the scope of any existing obligation of the Company with respect to payments to be made under Section  2 of the Separation Agreement. 

(f)        Former Director acknowledges that there is a risk that after signing this Agreement he may discover losses or claims that are released under this Agreement, but that are presently unknown to him.  Former Director assumes this risk and understands that this Agreement shall apply to any such losses and claims.

Former Director acknowledges that by accepting the Consideration, he assumes and waives the risks that the facts and the law may be other than as he believes.   

2.         Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to affect the independent right and responsibility of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (   EEOC   ) to enforce the law;   provided  ,    however  , Former Director is barred from receiving any monetary damages in connection with any EEOC proceeding concerning matters covered by this Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

3.         This Agreement shall not be construed as an admission by any of the Releasees or the Former Director of any violation of any federal, state or local law. 

4.         FORMER DIRECTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE HAS BEEN ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY; THAT TO THE EXTENT HE HAS DESIRED, HE HAS AVAILED HIMSELF OF THAT RIGHT; THAT HE HAS CAREFULLY READ AND

(a)        Each Investor agrees and acknowledges that (i) none of the Agents has made, or will make, any representations or warranties with respect to the Company or the offer and sale of the Shares, and such Investor will not rely on any statements made by any Agent, orally or in writing, to the contrary; (ii) it will be responsible for conducting its own due diligence investigation with respect to the Company and the offer and sale of the Shares, (iii) it will be purchasing Shares based on the results of its own due diligence investigation of the Company, (iv) it has negotiated the offer and sale of the Shares directly with the Company, and the Agents will not be responsible for the ultimate success of any such investment and (v) the decision to invest in the Company will involve a significant degree of risk, including a risk of total loss of such investment.  Each Investor further represents and warrants to each Agent that it, including any fund or funds that it manages or advises that participates in the offer and sale of the Shares, is permitted under its constitutive documents (including, without limitation, all limited partnership agreements, charters, bylaws, limited liability company agreements, all applicable side letters with investors, and similar documents) to make investments of the type contemplated by this Agreement.  In light of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Investor releases each Agent, its employees, officers, representatives and Affiliates from any liability with respect to such Investor s participation in the offer and sale of the Shares including, but not limited to, any improper payment made in accordance with the information   provided by the Company. This Section 9.13 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  The Agents have introduced each Investor to the Company in reliance on the Investor s understanding and agreement to this Section 9.13. 

(b)        The parties agree and acknowledge that each Agent may rely on the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement and may rely on the representations and warranties of the respective Investors contained in this Agreement as if such representations, warranties, agreements and covenants, as applicable, were made directly to such Agent.  The parties further agree each Agent may rely on the legal opinions to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.1(i) hereof. 

(c)        Each Investor agrees, for the express benefit of the Agents, that: no Agent, nor any of its Affiliates or any of its representatives (1) has any duties or obligations with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby other than those specifically set forth herein or in the engagement letter, to be entered into between the Company and the Agents; (2) shall be liable for any improper payment made in accordance with the information provided by the Company; (3) makes any representation or warranty, or has any responsibilities as to the validity, accuracy, value or genuineness of any information, certificates or documentation delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents; or (4) shall be liable to such Investor (x) for any action taken, suffered or omitted by any of them in good faith and reasonably believed to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Agreement or any Transaction Document or (y) for anything which any of them may do or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement or any Transaction Document, except for such Agent s own gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith.  The Agents, their Affiliates and their representatives shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Company for acting as placement agents hereunder pursuant the indemnification provisions set forth in the engagement letter referenced above.

CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS OF RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES OF 

SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK OF 

GENCO SHIPPING   TRADING LIMITED 

The undersigned, John C. Wobensmith, does hereby certify:  

1.      That he is the duly elected and acting President and Secretary of Genco Shipping   Trading Limited a Marshall Islands corporation (the    Company   ).  

2.      That pursuant to the authority conferred by the Company s Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, the Company s Board of Directors on [__________], 2016 adopted the following resolution designating and prescribing the relative rights, preferences and limitations of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock:  

RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors (the    Board   ) of the Company by the Articles of Incorporation, the Board does hereby establish a series of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, and the designation and certain powers, preferences and other special rights of the shares of such series, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, are hereby fixed as follows: 

Section 1.   Designation and Amount  .  The shares of such series shall be designated as    Series A Preferred Stock   .  The  Series A Preferred Stock shall have a par value of $0.01 per share, and the number of shares constituting such series shall initially be 27,061,856, which number the Board may from time to time increase or decrease (but not below the number then outstanding).  The Series A Preferred Stock shall have a liquidation preference of $4.85 per share (the    Liquidation Preference   ). 

Section 2.   Ranking  .  The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company, (a) senior to the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the    Common Stock   ), whether now outstanding or hereafter issued, and to each other class or series of stock of the Company (including any series of preferred stock established after [___________], 2016 (the    Issue Date   ) by the Board of Directors) the terms of which do not expressly provide that such class or series ranks senior to, or   pari passu,   with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as    Junior Stock   ); (b)   pari passu   with each other class or series of stock of the Company established after the Issue Date by the Board of Directors the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series ranks   pari passu   with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as    Parity Stock   ); and (c) junior to each other class or series of stock of the Company established after the Issue Date by the Board of Directors the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series ranks senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company (collectively referred to as    Senior Stock   ). The Company s ability to issue Capital Stock that ranks   pari passu   with or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.  

Section 3.   Dividends  .  (a) Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock payable semiannually, which dividends shall be declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of the assets of the Company legally available therefor, and shall be payable semiannually commencing on the 180th day following the Issue Date (or the following Business Day if any such payment date is not a Business Day) (each such date being referred to herein as a    Dividend Payment Date   ) at the rate per annum of 6% per share on the Liquidation Preference;   provided   that, in the event that on any Dividend Payment Date, the  

Company is not permitted to declare or pay such dividend or incur such liability either (x) as a matter of law or (y) under the   terms of any loan agreement, credit agreement, guaranty, or related agreement, such dividend (a    Deferred Dividend   ) shall not be declared by the Board of Directors, shall not be paid or payable on such Dividend Payment Date and no liability shall be incurred in respect thereof, and instead, such Deferred Dividend shall be declared, become payable and be paid and the liability in respect thereof be incurred on the first succeeding Dividend Payment Date on which the Company is not prohibited from declaring, paying and incurring the liability in respect of such Deferred Dividend (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Deferred Dividend shall be payable in addition to, and not in lieu of, any dividend which would ordinarily be payable on such succeeding Dividend Payment Date). The amount of dividends payable for any other period that is shorter or longer than a full semiannual dividend period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.  

Commencing on and following the Meeting End Date, in the event that dividends are paid on shares of Common Stock in any dividend period with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, then a dividend shall be payable in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock for such period in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount otherwise payable in respect of such share of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the foregoing paragraph and (ii) the product of (A) the aggregate dividends payable per share of Common Stock in such dividend period times (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible.  

For purposes of this Section 3(a), a dividend period with respect to a Dividend Payment Date is the period commencing on the preceding Dividend Payment Date (or, if there is no preceding Dividend Payment Date, the Issue Date) and ending on the day immediately prior to the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends payable on a Dividend Payment Date shall be payable to Holders of record on the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof declares the dividend payable (each, a    Dividend Record Date   ).  

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3(a) to the contrary, and without limiting any other remedy available to the Company or any other party, dividends shall not accrue or be payable in respect of shares initially issued to any Holder who is contractually obligated to appear and vote in favor of any proposal made at a meeting of stockholders of the Company in order to effect the Stockholder Approval (or whose transferor Holder was so obligated) if such Holder (or such transferor Holder or the Affiliates of either) fails so to appear and vote in favor.  Any shares issued to such Holders shall bear the Stockholder Approval Legend. 

(b)   Payment of Dividends  . The Company may make each dividend payment on the Series A Preferred Stock either (i) in cash (or, if applicable, in the same form as such dividend is paid to holders of Common Stock) or (ii) at the Company s option, by the issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including fractional shares) having an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the amount of the dividend to be paid (or, in the case of a non-cash distribution, having an aggregate Liquidation Preference equal to the fair market value of such dividend (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution)). Each fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall be entitled to a ratably proportionate amount of all dividends accumulating with respect to each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3, and all such dividends with respect to such outstanding fractional shares shall accumulate (whether or not declared) and shall be payable in the same manner and at such times as provided for in Section 3 with respect to dividends on each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock. No interest or sum of money in lieu of interest shall be payable in respect of any dividends or payment that may be in arrears.  

(c)   Payment Restrictions  . No dividends or other distributions (other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior  

2 

Stock (in the case of Junior Stock) and other than cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) may be declared,   made or paid, or set apart for payment upon, any Parity Stock or Junior Stock, nor may any Parity Stock or Junior Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any money paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any Parity Stock or Junior Stock) by or on behalf of the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock (in the case of Parity Stock) or Junior Stock (in the case of Junior Stock)), unless all accrued and unpaid dividends shall have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid (in cash or in kind), or are declared and a sum of cash sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for such payment, on the Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock for all dividend payment periods terminating on or prior to the date of such declaration, payment, redemption, purchase or acquisition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if full dividends have not been paid on the Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, dividends may be declared and paid on the Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock so long as the dividends are declared and paid   pro rata   so that the aggregate amounts of dividends declared per share on, and the amounts of such dividends declared in cash or in kind, as applicable, per share on, the Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued and unpaid dividends per share on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and such other Parity Stock bear to each other.  

Section 4.   Liquidation Preference  . In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, each Holder shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to stockholders of the Company, before any distribution of assets is made on the Common Stock or any other Junior Stock, an amount equal to the greater of (i) the aggregate Liquidation Preference attributable to shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15(a), plus an amount equal to the sum of all accrued and unpaid cumulative dividends, and (ii) the product of (x) the amount per share that would have been payable upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up to the holders of shares of Common Stock or such other class or series of securities into which the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible (assuming the conversion of each share of Series A Preferred Stock), multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock or such other securities into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder are then convertible.  

None of (i) the sale of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Company (other than in connection with the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company), (ii) the merger, conversion or consolidation of the Company into or with any other Person or (iii) the merger, conversion or consolidation of any other Person into or with the Company, shall constitute a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company for the purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph.  

In the event the assets of the Company available for distribution to Holders upon any liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such Holders are entitled pursuant to this Section 4, no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of Parity Stock upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up unless proportionate distributable amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which Holders and holders of any Parity Stock are entitled upon such liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, with the amount allocable to each series of such stock determined on a   pro rata   basis of the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of each series and accrued and unpaid dividends to which each series is entitled.  

After the payment to the Holders of the full preferential amounts provided for above, the Holders as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company.  

3 

Section 5.   Voting Rights  . 

(a) The Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights, including the right to elect any directors, except (i) voting rights, if any, required by law, and (ii) voting rights, if any, described in this Section 5.  

(b) So long as any Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, in addition to any other vote of stockholders of the Company required under applicable law or the Articles of Incorporation, the affirmative vote or consent of  the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, will be required (i) for any amendment of the Articles of Incorporation if the amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Holders so as to affect them adversely, (ii) to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase, any Parity Stock or Senior Stock, or (iii) to reclassify any authorized stock of the Company into any Parity Stock or Senior Stock, or any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase any Parity Stock or Senior Stock. No such vote shall be required for the Company to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase, any Junior Stock.  

Section 6.   Conversion  .   

(a)   Mandatory Conversion  . Effective as of the close of business on the Stockholder Approval Date, with respect to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock of a Holder, such Holder s shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically, without any action of such Holder, convert into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate Liquidation Preference of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock   divided by   the Conversion Price then in effect (such quotient, the    Conversion Shares   ).  

(b) In addition, effective as of the close of business on the Stockholder Approval Date, a Holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, at the election of the Company, either (i) cash in an amount equal to the then unpaid Deferred Dividends in respect of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder or (ii) a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the amount of any then unpaid Deferred Dividends in respect of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder   divided by   the Conversion Price then in effect (such quotient, the    Dividend Shares   ).  

No Holder may convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock other than pursuant to Section 6(a).  

(c)   Conversion Procedures  .   

(i) In the event of conversion pursuant to Section 6(a), the Company shall deliver as promptly as practicable written notice to each holder specifying: (A) the Stockholder Approval Date; (B) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued in respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock that is converted; (C) the place or places where certificates or evidence of book-entry notation for such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for issuance of certificates or evidence of book-entry notation representing shares of Common Stock; and (D) that dividends on the shares to be converted will cease to accrue on such Stockholder Approval Date. Unless the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion are to be issued in the same name as the name in which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are registered, each share surrendered for mandatory conversion shall be accompanied by instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the holder thereof or such holder s duly authorized attorney and an amount sufficient to pay any transfer or similar tax in accordance with Section 15(f).  

4 

(ii) The conversion shall be deemed to have been effected at the close of business on the Stockholder Approval Date. At such time: (A) the person in whose name or names any   certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such mandatory conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby at such time; (B) such shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of a holder with respect to such shares shall immediately terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock and other amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6 and the right to receive any dividend declared but not yet paid pursuant to Section 3.  

(iii) Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the close of business on a Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the mandatory conversion thereof following such Dividend Record Date and prior to such Dividend Payment Date. In such event, any such dividend that would otherwise be payable in the form of Series A Preferred Stock shall be payable to such Holder either (i) in cash or (ii) at the Company s option, in shares of Common Stock converted at the Conversion Price in effect as of the time of such mandatory conversion.  

(iv) In connection with the mandatory conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, no fractions of shares of Common Stock shall be issued, but in lieu thereof the Company shall pay an amount of cash in respect of such fractional interest equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Stockholder Approval Date.  

Section 7.   Settlement upon Conversion  . The Company shall satisfy its obligation to deliver Conversion Shares and, if applicable, Dividend Shares (or such other class or series of securities into which the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible) upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock by delivering to each Holder surrendering shares of Series A Preferred Stock for conversion a number of shares of Common Stock (or such other class or series of securities into which the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible) equal to the number of Conversion Shares and, if applicable, Dividend Shares to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 6 (  provided   that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares), as soon as practicable after the third Trading Day (but in no event later than the fifth Business Day) following the Stockholder Approval Date. In the event the Company elects to pay cash pursuant to Section 6(b)(i), such cash payment shall be made on the same date.  

Section 8.   Anti-dilution Adjustments  . 

(a) The Conversion Price shall be subject to the following adjustments from time to time:  

(i)   Stock Dividends  . In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in Common Stock, the Conversion Price, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination;   provided  ,    however  , that no such adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution pursuant to Section 3.  

(ii)    Stock Purchase Rights  . In case the Company shall issue to all holders of its Common Stock options, warrants or other rights entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares  

5 

of Common Stock for a period expiring within 60 days from the date of issuance of such options, warrants or other rights at a price per share of Common Stock less than 95% of the Market Value on   the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such options, warrants or other rights (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment, share purchase or similar plan), the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination   plus   the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration expected to be received by the Company upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such options, warrants or other rights (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) would purchase at such Market Value and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination   plus   the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, either directly or indirectly, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination;   provided  ,    however  , that no such adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such options, warrants or other rights pursuant to Section    provided  ,    further  ,    however  , that if any of the foregoing options, warrants or other rights are only exercisable upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event, then the Conversion Price will not be adjusted until such Triggering Event occurs.  

(iii)   Stock Splits, Reverse Splits and Combinations  . In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided, split or reclassified into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or reclassified into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split, reclassification or combination becomes effective.  

(iv)   Debt, Asset or Security Distributions  . 

(A) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, assets or securities (but excluding any dividend or distribution of options, warrants or other rights referred to in paragraph (ii) of this Section 8(a), any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, any dividend or distribution of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-off referred to in the next subparagraph, or any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (i) of this Section 8(a)), the Conversion Price shall be reduced by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Market Value on the date fixed for such determination minus the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be the Market Value on the date fixed for such determination, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior  

6 

to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this subparagraph (iv)(A) is applicable, subparagraph (iv)(B) of this Section 8(a) shall not be applicable. No adjustment to the   Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 3.  

(B) In the case of a Spin-off, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution shall be reduced by multiplying the Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Market Value on the date fixed for such determination   minus   the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the shares (or fractions thereof) of Capital Stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be the Market Value. Any adjustment to the Conversion Price under this subparagraph (iv)(B) will occur on the date that is the earlier of (1) the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-off and (2) the date of the Initial Public Offering of the securities being distributed in the Spin-off, if that Initial Public Offering is effected simultaneously with the Spin-off. No adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made if the Holders would be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 3.  

(v)   Tender Offers  . In the case that a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of the Company (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares) of aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) per share of Common Stock that exceeds the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, then, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the last time (the    Expiration Time   ) tenders or exchanges could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof), the Conversion Price shall be reduced by multiplying the Conversion Price immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Market Value on the date of the Expiration Time and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the Expiration Time, and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Market Value on the date of the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered or exchanged, not withdrawn and accepted for payment on the date of the Expiration Time (such validly tendered or exchanged shares, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the    Purchased Shares   )   plus   (y) the amount of cash   plus   the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of the Company pursuant to the tender or exchange offer (assuming the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares).  

(b)   De minimis Adjustments  . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment under this Section 8 need be made to the Conversion Price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of the Conversion Price then in effect. Any lesser  

7 

adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent adjustment, if any, which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall result in an increase or decrease of at least 1.0% of such Conversion Price. No adjustment under this Section 8 shall be made if such adjustment will result in a Conversion Price that is less than the par value of the Common Stock.  

(c)   Tax-Related Adjustments  . The Company may make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by this Section 8, as the Board of Directors considers advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. In the event the Company elects to make such a reduction in the Conversion Price, the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder if and to the extent that such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the reduction in the Conversion Price.  

(d)   Stockholder Rights Plans  . Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent that the Holders receive Common Stock, such Holders shall receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights issued under any future stockholder rights plan the Company may establish whether or not such rights are separated from the Common Stock prior to conversion. A distribution of rights pursuant to any stockholder rights plan will not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii) or 7(a)(iv),   provided   that the Company has provided for the Holders to receive such rights upon conversion.  

(e)   Notice of Adjustment  . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted in accordance with this Section 8, the Company shall (i) compute the Conversion Price in accordance with this Section 8 and prepare and transmit to the Transfer Agent an Officer s Certificate setting forth the Conversion Price, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based and (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 8 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, the Transfer Agent shall provide a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event and a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to the Conversion Price was determined and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price.  

(f)   Reversal of Adjustment  . If the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter (and before the dividend or distribution has been paid or delivered to stockholders) legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Price then in effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.  

(g)   Exceptions to Adjustment  . The applicable Conversion Price shall not be adjusted:  

(i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company s securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any such plan;  

(ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, the Holders shall become entitled upon conversion to any securities other than, or in addition to, shares of Common Stock, thereafter the number or amount of such other securities so receivable upon conversion shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Common Stock set forth in this Certificate of Designations.  

Section 10.   Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets  . 

(a) The Company, without the consent of the Holders, may consolidate with or merge into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to any Person or may permit any Person to consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all its properties to, the Company (any of the foregoing,    Reorganization   );   provided  ,    however  , that the shares of Series A Preferred Stock will become the kind and amount of securities of such successor, transferee or lessee, cash and other property receivable by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible immediately prior to such Reorganization, having in respect of such successor, transferee or lessee the same power, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon.  

(b) Upon any consolidation by the Company with, or merger by the Company into, any other Person or any conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all the assets of the Company as described in Section 10(a), the successor resulting from such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the transferee or lessee to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made, will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the predecessor (if still in existence) will be released from its obligations and covenants with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock.

(b) When the Company is required, pursuant to this Certificate of Designations, to give notice to Holders without specifying the method of giving such notice, the Company shall do so by sending notice via first class mail or by overnight courier to the Holders of record as of a reasonably current date.

Notwithstanding anything else, Escrow Agent shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and without negligence, gross negligence or misconduct if Escrow Agent is authorized to execute the payment order under this Section 1.5.   

(e)     The security procedures set forth in this Section 1.5 are intended to verify the authenticity of orders provided to Escrow Agent and are not designed to, and do not, detect errors in the transmission or content of any order.  Escrow Agent is not responsible for detecting an error in the order, regardless of whether either party believes the error was apparent, and Escrow Agent is not liable for any damages arising from any failure to detect an error. 

(f)     When instructed to credit or pay a party by both name and a unique numeric or alpha-numeric identifier (e.g. ABA number or account number), Escrow Agent, and any other banks participating in the funds transfer, may rely solely on the unique identifier, even if it identifies a party different than the party named.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Escrow Agent shall not be required to treat a payment order as having been received until Escrow Agent has authenticated it pursuant to the security procedures in this Section 1.5 and shall not be liable or responsible for any losses arising in relation to such delay or failure to act.

Accordingly, this letter shall not constitute any waiver by the Finance Parties of any breach or default by any Group Member and the Finance Parties reserve all rights in relation thereto (the "  Reservation  "), except as otherwise expressly set out in this letter and subject only to the terms of this letter. 

5.2             Neither the passing of time nor any inaction, action, omission, statement or discussion by, or on the part of, any Finance Party in relation to all matters referred to above or any other matter arising under the Finance Documents shall be taken in any way as constituting a waiver of, or as prejudicing or limiting, any of the rights, powers or remedies which that Finance Party may now, or hereafter, have under and pursuant to the Finance Documents or otherwise. 

4 

5.3             The Reservation is made without prejudice to, and without intention of amending, clause 33 (  Remedies and Waivers  ) of the Loan Agreement, the content of which is hereby expressly repeated and averred. 

5.4             Nothing in this letter, any document or in any correspondence, meeting or discussion a Finance Party has had or may have with any Group Member in relation to (i) the matters related to the Waiver, (ii) any other Events of Default which occur or may occur after the date of this letter, (iii) the refinancing or restructuring of the Borrowers' Loan and other obligations under the Finance Documents or (iv) any other matters shall, except as otherwise expressly provided in this letter:  

(a)              prejudice the position of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or be construed as a waiver of any Group Member's obligations under or pursuant to the Finance Document to which that Group Member is a party; or 

(b)             be deemed to constitute an amendment or waiver of any provision of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document or a commitment to amend, waive or restructure any provision in the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document. 

Any such correspondence, meeting or discussion in each case shall be entirely without prejudice to the rights, powers and remedies of the Finance Parties under or in respect of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document and all such rights, powers and remedies are expressly reserved. 

6                Undertakings, Representations and Warranties 

6.1             During the Waiver Period, you shall promptly notify us if:

(ii)       any Enforcement Action is commenced against a Group Member.

6.3             During the Waiver Period, the Borrower undertakes that except to the extent subject to the Waiver it will not use any actions taken by any Lender in connection with the Loan Agreement as a basis to assert any claims or defences of any kind or nature against any Lender in connection with its respective rights and remedies under any Finance Document, including without limitation any Lender s rights to take enforcement actions, and the Borrower hereby waives any and all such claims or defences. 

6.4             During the Waiver Period, the Borrower undertakes and acknowledges that the Lenders are entitled to receive, have received and may continue to receive  

5

(a)         prejudice the position of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or be construed as a waiver of any Group Member's obligations under or pursuant to the Finance Document to which that Group Member is a party; or 

(b)         be deemed to constitute an amendment or waiver of any provision of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document or a commitment to amend, waive or restructure any provision in the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document. 

Any such correspondence, meeting or discussion in each case shall be entirely without prejudice to the rights, powers and remedies of the Finance Parties under or in respect of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document and all such rights, powers and remedies are expressly reserved. 

7            Undertakings, Representations and Warranties 

7.1         During the Waiver Period, you shall promptly notify us if:

6 

limitation any Lender s rights to take enforcement actions, and the Borrower hereby waives any and all such claims or defences.

The Security Parties agree that nothing in this letter shall in any way impede, impair, limit or restrict any Lender s rights to obtain and use such information in any manner and for any purpose permitted under the Finance Documents. 

7.5         The Borrower hereby represents and warrants that (a) the representations and warranties of the Security Parties set forth in the each of the Finance Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date hereof to the same extent as though made on and as of such date except to the extent such representations and warranties specifically relate to an earlier date and (b) after giving effect to the Waiver and the Amendments, no event has occurred and is continuing which constitutes a default or Event of Default under any Finance Document or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Event of Default. 

7.6         The Security Parties affirm all of their obligations under each Finance Document as modified hereby and agree that this letter shall not operate to reduce or discharge their obligations under any Finance Document.

5            Finance Parties' Rights 

5.1         Nothing in this letter shall prevent the Finance Parties from taking any Enforcement Action after the Waiver Period or after the Waiver ceases to apply in respect of any Event of Default which has occurred or may occur during the Waiver Period or which occurs or continues after the termination of the Waiver, regardless of whether such Event of Default occurred prior to or during the Waiver Period.  Accordingly, this letter shall not constitute any waiver by the Finance Parties of any breach or default by any Group Member and the Finance Parties reserve all rights in relation thereto (the "  Reservation  "), except as otherwise expressly set out in this letter and subject only to the terms of this letter. 

5.2         Neither the passing of time nor any inaction, action, omission, statement or discussion by, or on the part of, any Finance Party in relation to all matters referred to above or any other matter arising under the Finance Documents shall be taken in any way as constituting a waiver of, or as prejudicing or limiting, any of the rights, powers or remedies which that Finance Party may now, or hereafter, have under and pursuant to the Finance Documents or otherwise. 

4 

5.3         The Reservation is made without prejudice to, and without intention of amending, clause 33 (  Remedies and Waivers  ) of the Loan Agreement, the content of which is hereby expressly repeated and averred. 

5.4         Nothing in this letter, any document or in any correspondence, meeting or discussion a Finance Party has had or may have with any Group Member in relation to (i) the matters related to the Waiver, (ii) any other Events of Default which occur or may occur after the date of this letter, (iii) the refinancing or restructuring of the Borrowers' Loan and other obligations under the Finance Documents or (iv) any other matters shall, except as otherwise expressly provided in this letter:  

(a)          prejudice the position of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or be construed as a waiver of any Group Member's obligations under or pursuant to the Finance Document to which that Group Member is a party; or 

(b)          be deemed to constitute an amendment or waiver of any provision of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document or a commitment to amend, waive or restructure any provision in the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document. 

Any such correspondence, meeting or discussion in each case shall be entirely without prejudice to the rights, powers and remedies of the Finance Parties under or in respect of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document and all such rights, powers and remedies are expressly reserved. 

6            Undertakings, Representations and Warranties

6.3         During the Waiver Period, the Borrower undertakes that except to the extent subject to the Waiver it will not use any actions taken by any Lender in connection with the Loan Agreement as a basis to assert any claims or defences of any kind or nature against any Lender in connection with its respective rights and remedies under any Finance Document, including without limitation any Lender s rights to take enforcement actions, and the Borrower hereby waives any and all such claims or defences. 

6.4         During the Waiver Period, the Borrower undertakes and acknowledges that the Lenders are entitled to receive, have received and may continue to  

5 

receive information regarding the Group under or in connection with the Finance Documents. The Security Parties agree that nothing in this letter shall in any way impede, impair, limit or restrict any Lender s rights to obtain and use such information in any manner and for any purpose permitted under the Finance Documents. 

6.5         The Borrower hereby represents and warrants that (a) the representations and warranties of the Security Parties set forth in the each of the Finance Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date hereof to the same extent as though made on and as of such date except to the extent such representations and warranties specifically relate to an earlier date and (b) after giving effect to the Waiver, no event has occurred and is continuing which constitutes a default or Event of Default under any Finance Document or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Event of Default. 

6.6         The Security Parties affirm all of their obligations under each Finance Document as modified hereby and agree that this letter shall not operate to reduce or discharge their obligations under any Finance Document. 

7                Continuing Security

4.3         Each of the Security Parties confirms that all of its respective obligations under or pursuant to each of the Security Documents to which it is a party remain in full force and effect, despite the amendments to the Loan Agreement and the  

4 

Guarantee made in this letter, as if all references in any of the Security Documents to the Loan Agreement are references to the Loan Agreement and the Guarantee as amended by this letter.  

4.4         The definition of any term defined in any of the Security Documents shall, to the extent necessary, be modified to reflect the amendments to the Loan Agreement and the Guarantee made in or pursuant to this letter.

5.1         The Waiver shall be revoked, shall become null and void ab initio (as if it were never executed) and shall cease to be in full force and effect automatically and with immediate effect if any event specified in paragraph 5.1(a) to (e) below occurs (each a "  Termination Event  "), unless such Termination Events are expressly waived by the Agent, acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders, provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Amendments set forth in paragraph 4.1 of this letter shall not be subject to termination:

(e)          any waivers or consent letters in relation to any Other Credit Agreements cease to be in full force and effect or any party thereto denies or disaffirms their obligations thereunder. 

6            Finance Parties' Rights 

6.1         Nothing in this letter shall prevent the Finance Parties from taking any Enforcement Action after the Waiver Period or after the Waiver ceases to apply in respect of any Event of Default which has occurred or may occur during the Waiver Period or which occurs or continues after the termination of the Waiver, regardless of whether such Event of Default occurred prior to or during the Waiver Period.  Accordingly, this letter shall not constitute any waiver by the Finance Parties of any breach or default by any Group Member and the Finance Parties reserve all rights in relation thereto (the "  Reservation  "), except as otherwise expressly set out in this letter and subject only to the terms of this letter. 

6.2         Neither the passing of time nor any inaction, action, omission, statement or discussion by, or on the part of, any Finance Party in relation to all matters referred to above or any other matter arising under the Finance Documents  

5 

shall be taken in any way as constituting a waiver of, or as prejudicing or limiting, any of the rights, powers or remedies which that Finance Party may now, or hereafter, have under and pursuant to the Finance Documents or otherwise. 

6.3         The Reservation is made without prejudice to, and without intention of amending, clause 33 (  Remedies and Waivers  ) of the Loan Agreement, the content of which is hereby expressly repeated and averred.

(a)          prejudice the position of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or be construed as a waiver of any Group Member's obligations under or pursuant to the Finance Document to which that Group Member is a party; or 

(b)          be deemed to constitute an amendment or waiver of any provision of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document or a commitment to amend, waive or restructure any provision in the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document. 

Any such correspondence, meeting or discussion in each case shall be entirely without prejudice to the rights, powers and remedies of the Finance Parties under or in respect of the Loan Agreement, the Guarantee or any other Finance Document and all such rights, powers and remedies are expressly reserved. 

7            Undertakings, Representations and Warranties 

7.1          During the Waiver Period, you shall promptly notify us if:

6 

limitation any Lender s rights to take enforcement actions, and the Borrower hereby waives any and all such claims or defences. 

7.4         During the Waiver Period, the Borrower undertakes and acknowledges that the Lenders are entitled to receive, have received and may continue to receive information regarding the Group under or in connection with the Finance Documents. The Security Parties agree that nothing in this letter shall in any way impede, impair, limit or restrict any Lender s rights to obtain and use such information in any manner and for any purpose permitted under the Finance Documents. 

7.5         The Borrower hereby represents and warrants that (a) the representations and warranties of the Security Parties set forth in the each of the Finance Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date hereof to the same extent as though made on and as of such date except to the extent such representations and warranties specifically relate to an earlier date and (b) after giving effect to the Waiver and the Amendments, no event has occurred and is continuing which constitutes a default or Event of Default under any Finance Document or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Event of Default. 

7.6         The Security Parties affirm all of their obligations under each Finance Document as modified hereby and agree that this letter shall not operate to reduce or discharge their obligations under any Finance Document. 

8                Continuing Security
