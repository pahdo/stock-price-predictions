Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

(a) Nature of Operations and Principles
of Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Southeastern Bank Financial Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Georgia Bank  
Trust Company of Augusta, Georgia, together referred to as  the Company.  Significant intercompany transactions and
balances are eliminated in consolidation. Dollar amounts are rounded to thousands except share and per share data. 

The Company provides financial services
through its offices in Richmond and Columbia Counties, Georgia, and Aiken County, South Carolina. Its primary deposit products
are checking, savings, and term certificate accounts, and its primary lending products are residential mortgage, commercial, and
installment loans. Substantially all loans are secured by specific items of collateral including business assets, consumer assets,
and commercial and residential real estate. Commercial loans are expected to be repaid from cash flow from operations of businesses.
The Company has a significant concentration of commercial real estate loans. The ability of these customers to repay their loans
is dependent on the real estate and general economic conditions in the area. 

The financial statements for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited and have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary to present fairly the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods have been
made. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations which the Company may achieve for the entire year. 

Some items in the prior period financial
statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 

(b) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the FASB issued an update
(ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers) creating FASB Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The guidance
in this update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into
contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example,
insurance contracts or lease contracts). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides steps to follow to achieve the core principle. An
entity should disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative information is required
about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain
or fulfill a contract. The amendments in this update are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued an update
(ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.) The guidance in this update affects
any entity that holds financial assets or owes financial liabilities. It is intended to provide users of financial statements with
more useful information on the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments by requiring (1)
equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in net income (2) public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments
for disclosure purposes (3) entities to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the
fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure
the liability at fair value (4) a separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and
form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes and eliminating (1) the requirement to disclose the fair
value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities and (2) the requirement
for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required
to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. The amendments in this update are effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued an update
(ASU No. 2016-02, Leases) creating FASB Topic 842, Leases. The guidance is intended to increase transparency and comparability
among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring more disclosures related
to leasing transactions. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued an update
(ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations.) The amendments in this update
affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendments do not change the core principal of the
guidance, but rather clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The amendments in this update
are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued an update
(ASU No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.) The guidance in this update affects
any entity that issues share-based payment awards to its employees and is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment awards including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued an update
(ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments: Credit Losses.) The guidance affects entities holding financial assets and net investment
in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments in this update require timelier recording
of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments and are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued an update (ASU No. 2016-15,
Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.) This guidance is intended to reduce diversity
in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update are effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

(c) Merger 

On June 16, 2016, the Company entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with South State Corporation, a South Carolina corporation
( South State ). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein,
the Company will merge with and into South State (the  Merger ), with South State as the surviving corporation in the
Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Georgia Bank   Trust Company of
Augusta ( Georgia Bank   Trust ), will merge with and into South State s wholly-owned subsidiary bank, South
State Bank (the  Bank Merger ), with South State Bank as the surviving entity in the Bank Merger. As of October 17,
2016, South State received all regulatory approvals for the Merger and the Bank Merger. A special meeting of shareholders of Southeastern
Bank Financial was held on October 18, 2016 where shareholders voted to approve the Merger. The Company expects to complete the
Merger on or around January 3, 2017. 

Note 2   Investment Securities 

All investment securities held at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are classified as available-for-sale. 

The following tables summarize the amortized
cost and fair value of the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the
corresponding amounts of unrealized gains and losses therein. 

* Government sponsored entities 

* Government sponsored entities 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, except for the U.S. Government agencies and government sponsored entities, there was no issuer who represented 10% or more
of stockholders  equity within the investment portfolio. 

Proceeds from sales of securities available-for-sale
and the associated gains (losses), excluding gains (losses) on called securities, for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

The amortized cost and fair value of the
investment securities portfolio are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities
if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

The following tables summarize the investment
securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, aggregated by investment category and length of
time the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position. 

Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment   September 30, 2016  

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary
impairment ( OTTI ) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such
an evaluation. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are generally evaluated for OTTI under
the provisions of ASC 320-10,  Investments   Debt and Equity Securities.  In determining OTTI, management considers
many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial
condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4)
whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security
before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity
and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. 

When OTTI occurs, the amount of the OTTI
recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required
to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not it
will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the OTTI shall be recognized in earnings equal
to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If an
entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security
before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the OTTI shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount
related to all other factors. The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value
of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is
recognized in other comprehensive income or loss, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized
in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company s
security portfolio consisted of 410 securities, 63 of which were in an unrealized loss position. Of these securities with unrealized
losses, 87.08% were related to the Company s mortgage-backed and corporate securities as discussed below. 

Mortgage-backed Securities  

At September 30, 2016, all of the Company s
mortgage-backed securities were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, primarily the Federal National Mortgage
Association ( Fannie Mae ), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) and the Government
National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ), institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support.
Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and because
the Company does not have the intent to sell these mortgage-backed securities and it is not more likely than not that it will be
required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily
impaired at September 30, 2016. 

Corporate Securities  

The Company holds forty-two corporate securities totaling $114,913,
of which thirteen had an unrealized loss of $921 at September 30, 2016. Twelve of the securities with an unrealized loss of $903
were issued by entities rated lower medium investment grade or higher. Because the decline in fair value is attributable primarily
to changes in interest rates and not credit quality and because the Company does not have the intent to sell the securities and
it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company does
not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016. 

Included in the Company s corporate
bonds is one trust preferred security with an amortized cost of $250, which had an unrealized loss of $18, resulting in a fair
value of $232 at September 30, 2016. This security is not rated. Although the issuer is not in default, in January of 2011 the
Company was notified that the issuer had elected to defer interest payments in accordance with the terms of the instrument. As
of July of 2015, the issuer is no longer deferring interest and is current on all payments. Because the Company does not have the
intent to sell this security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated
recovery, the Company does not consider this security to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016. 

There were no credit losses recognized
in earnings for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

(TDRs) with a balance of $7,460 and $8,636 included in impaired loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
No specific reserves were allocated to customers whose loan terms have been modified in TDRs as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. The Company is not committed to lend additional amounts as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 to customers with
outstanding loans that are classified as TDRs. 

The following tables present TDRs as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

No loans were modified as TDRs during the
three months ended September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, two loans were modified as TDRs. One modification
involved a 2.25% reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan and an extension of the maturity date for 277 months while the
other modification involved a 0.50% rate reduction. 

During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, two loans were modified as TDRs. One modification involved a 2.50% reduction of the stated interest rate of
the loan and an extension of the maturity date for 38 months while the other modification involved a 3.00% rate reduction and an
extension of the maturity date for 42 months. 

The following tables present loans by class

There was no increase to the allowance
for loan losses or resultant charge-offs on the TDRs described in the previous two tables during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Charge-offs on such loans are factored
into the rolling historical loss rate, which is used in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses. 

A loan is considered to be in payment default
once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms. There were no TDRs with payment defaults during the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, one ADC loan with a recorded investment of $1,372 defaulted during the third quarter of 2015 and the default
occurred within the twelve month period following the loan modification. 

The terms of certain other loans were modified
during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 that did not meet the definition of a TDR. Loans modified
during the three month periods have a total recorded investment as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $1,265 and $2,791, respectively,
and had delays in payment of 30 days in 2016 and delays of 30 days to 2 months in 2015. Loans modified during the nine month periods
have a total recorded investment as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $4,862 and $6,810, respectively, and had delays in payment
ranging from 30 days to 3 months in 2016 and 2015. The modification of these loans involved either a modification of the terms
of a loan to borrowers who were not experiencing financial difficulties or a delay in a payment that was considered to be insignificant. 

In order to determine whether a borrower
is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default
on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company s internal
underwriting policy. 

 Credit Quality Indicators: 

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on
relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment
experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company, through its
originating account officer, places an initial credit risk rating on every loan. An annual review and analysis of loan relationships
(irrespective of loan types included in the overall relationship) with total related exposure of $500 or greater is performed by
the Credit Administration department in order to update risk ratings given current available information. 

Through the review of delinquency reports,
updated financial statements or other relevant information in the normal course of business, the lending officer and/or Credit
Administration review personnel may determine that a loan relationship has weakened to the point that a criticized (Watch grade)
or classified (Substandard   Doubtful grades) status is warranted. When a loan relationship with total related exposure of
$200 or greater is adversely graded (Watch or above), the lending officer is then charged with preparing a Classified/Watch report
which outlines the background of the credit problem, current repayment status of the loans, current collateral evaluation and a
workout plan of action. This plan may include goals to improve the credit rating, assisting the borrower in moving the loans to
another institution and/or collateral liquidation. All such Classified/Watch reports are reviewed on a quarterly basis by members
of Executive Management at a regularly scheduled meeting in which each lending officer presents the workout plans for their criticized
credit relationships. 

The Company uses the following definitions
for risk ratings. 

Watch: Loans classified as watch have a
potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result
in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 

Substandard: Loans classified as substandard
are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans
so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by
the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful: Loans classified as doubtful
have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection
or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

Loans not meeting the criteria above that
are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows. 

Note 4   Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is the exchange price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires
an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard
describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: 

Level 1:  
      Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.   

Level 2:  
      Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.   

Level 3:  
      Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.   

In determining the appropriate levels,
the Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument: 

Investment Securities : The fair
values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices
are not available, fair values are calculated based on matrix pricing which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry
to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the
securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of
similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other non-observable market indicators
(Level 3). The fair values of Level 3 investment securities are determined by an independent third party. These valuations are
then reviewed by the Company s Controller and Chief Financial Officer. Discounted cash flows are calculated using spread
to swap and LIBOR curves that are updated to incorporate loss severities, volatility, credit spread and optionality. During times
when trading is more liquid, broker quotes are used (if available) to validate the model. Rating agency and industry research reports
as well as defaults and deferrals on individual securities are reviewed and incorporated into the calculations. 

Interest Rate Swap Derivatives: 
The fair value of interest rate swap derivatives is determined based on discounted cash flow valuation models using observable
market data as of the measurement date (Level 2 inputs). The fair value adjustment is included in other liabilities. 

Mortgage Banking Derivatives:  The
fair value of mortgage banking derivatives is determined by individual third party sales contract prices for the specific loans
held at each reporting period end (Level 2 inputs). The fair value adjustment is included in other assets. 

Loans Held for Sale : Loans held
for sale are carried at fair value, as determined by outstanding commitments, from third party investors (Level 2). 

Impaired Loans : The fair value of
collateral dependent impaired loans is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single
valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely
made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available.
Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Non-real
estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports,
adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation,
and management s expertise and knowledge of the client and client s business, resulting in Level 3 fair value classification.
Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. 

Other Real Estate Owned : Assets
acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired,
establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs
to sell. The fair value of other real estate owned is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize
a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are
routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data
available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair
value. Real estate owned properties are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. 

Appraisals for both collateral dependent impaired loans and
other real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers, certified residential appraisers or state licensed appraisers
whose qualifications and licenses are annually reviewed and verified by the Company. Once received, a member of the Real Estate
Valuation Department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value
and determines if reasonable. Appraisals for collateral dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned are updated annually.
On an annual basis the Company compares the actual selling costs of collateral that has been liquidated to the selling price to
determine what additional adjustment should be made to the appraisal value. The most recent analysis performed indicated that an
additional discount of 8% should be applied to properties with appraisals performed within 12 months. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured on a
Recurring Basis  

The following tables present the balances
of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the hierarchy as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. 

The Company s policy is to recognize
transfers into or out of a level as of the end of the reporting period. 

Transfers between Level 1 and Level
2:  

No securities were transferred between
Level 1 and Level 2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Transfers between Level 2 and Level
3:  

No securities were transferred between
Level 2 and Level 3 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. No securities were transferred between Level 2 and
Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, one corporate security
was transferred out of Level 3 and into Level 2 based on observable market data for this security due to increased market activity
for this security. This security with a market value of $138 as of March 31, 2015 was transferred on March 31, 2015. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, there were no assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

The following table presents a reconciliation and income statement
classification of gains and losses for all assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs

The Company uses an independent third party
to value its U.S. government agencies, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate bonds. Their approach uses relevant information
generated by transactions that have occurred in the market place that involve similar assets, as well as using cash flow information
when necessary. These inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly in the market place for similar assets. The Company
considers these valuations to be Level 2 pricing. 

The fair value of the Company s municipal
securities is determined by another independent third party. Their approach uses relevant information generated by transactions
that have occurred in the market place that involve similar assets. These inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly
in the market place for similar assets. The Company considers these valuations to be Level 2 pricing. 

For securities where quoted prices or market
prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows (Level 3 pricing) as determined
by an independent third party. The significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation model include prepayment rates, constant
default rates, loss severity and yields. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, there were no financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using level 3 inputs. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured on a
Non-Recurring Basis  

Assets and liabilities measured at fair
value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized below. 

(1) Includes loans directly charged down to fair value and loans
with specific reserves 

(1) Includes loans directly charged down to fair value and loans
with specific reserves 

The following represents impairment charges
recognized during the period: 

Impaired loans, which are measured for
impairment using the fair value of collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a recorded investment of $8,904, with a valuation
allowance of $1,283, resulting in an additional provision for loan losses of $1,084 and $1,317 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016. 

As of December 31, 2015, impaired loans
had a recorded investment of $10,171, resulting in an additional provision for loan losses of $3,342 for the year ending 2015. 

Other real estate owned was $276 which
consisted of the outstanding balance of $607, less a valuation allowance of $331, resulting in a write down of $84 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

As of December 31, 2015, other real estate
owned was $360 which consisted of the outstanding balance of $607, less a valuation allowance of $247. There were no write downs
on this property during the year ended 2015. 

The following tables present quantitative
information about level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Fair Value Option: 

The Company has elected the fair value
option for loans held for sale. These loans are intended for sale and the Company believes that the fair value is the best indicator
of the resolution of these loans. None of these loans are past due 90 days or more or on nonaccrual as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the aggregate fair value, unpaid principal balance (including accrued interest), and gain or loss was as follows: 

Interest income on loans held for sale
is recognized based on contractual rates and is reflected in loan interest income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive
income. The following table details gains and losses from changes in fair value included in earnings for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for loans held for sale. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments: 

Disclosure of fair value information about
financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value is required.
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial
instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s
entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. 

Because no market exists for a portion
of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience,
current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective
in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes
in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 

Fair value estimates are based on existing
on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the
value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the
realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered
in any of the estimates. 

The assumptions used in the estimation
of the fair value of the Company s financial instruments are explained below. Where quoted market prices are not available,
fair values are based on estimates using discounted cash flow and other valuation techniques. Discounted cash flows can be significantly
affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. The following fair value estimates
cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and should not be considered representative of the liquidation value
of the Company s financial instruments, but rather a good-faith estimate of the fair value of financial instruments held
by the Company. Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from disclosure requirements. 

The following methods and assumptions,
not previously presented, were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments: 

(a)  Cash and Cash Equivalents   

Fair value equals the carrying value of such assets
due to their nature and is classified as Level 1.  

(b)  Loans, net   

The fair value of loans is calculated
using discounted cash flows by loan type resulting in a Level 3 classification. The discount rate used to determine the present
value of the loan portfolio is an estimated market rate that reflects the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan portfolio
without considering widening credit spreads due to market illiquidity. The estimated maturity is based on the Company s historical
experience with repayments adjusted to estimate the effect of current market conditions. The carrying amount of related accrued
interest receivable, due to its short term nature, approximates its fair value, is not significant and is not disclosed. The fair
value of loans held for sale is estimated based upon binding contracts and quotes from third party investors resulting in a Level
2 classification. The allowance for loan losses is considered a reasonable discount for credit risk. The methods utilized to estimate
the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price. 

(c)  Restricted Equity Securities   

The
fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) stock was not practicable to determine due to restrictions placed on
its transferability.  

(d)  Deposits   

Fair values for certificates
of deposit have been determined using discounted cash flows. The discount rate used is based on estimated market rates for deposits
of similar remaining maturities and are classified as Level 2. The carrying amounts of all other deposits, due to their short-term
nature, approximate their fair values and are classified as Level 1. The carrying amount of related accrued interest payable, due
to its short-term nature, approximates its fair value, is not significant and is not disclosed. 

(e)  Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements   

Fair value approximates the
carrying value of such liabilities due to their short-term nature and is classified as Level 1. 

(f)  Advances from FHLB   

The fair value
of the FHLB advances is obtained from the FHLB and is calculated by discounting contractual cash flows using an estimated interest
rate based on the current rates available to the Company for debt of similar remaining maturities and collateral terms resulting
in a Level 2 classification. 

(g)  Subordinated debentures   

The fair value for subordinated
debentures is calculated using discounted cash flows based upon current market spreads to LIBOR for debt of similar remaining maturities
and collateral terms resulting in a Level 3 classification. 

(h)  Commitments   

The difference between the carrying values and fair values of
commitments to extend credit are not significant and are not disclosed. 

The carrying amounts and estimated fair
values of the Company s financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, not previously presented, are
as follows: 

Note 5   Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company s 2006 Long Term Incentive
Plan provides for the issuance of restricted stock awards to officers and directors. Compensation expense is recognized over the
vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the stock at issue date. 

On March 19, 2014, the Compensation Committee
of the Company approved grants of 63,000 shares to certain of its directors and executive officers. The fair value of the stock
was determined using the closing price on date of grant. The shares vest in equal one-third increments on each of February 1, 2015;
February 1, 2016; and February 1, 2017. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $350 in compensation
expense related to the restricted stock awards. 

A summary of changes in the Company s
nonvested shares for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

As of September 30, 2016, there was $156
of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under the Plan. This cost is being recognized over
a period of four months. 

The total fair value of shares vested during
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was $693 based on the market price as of the vesting date. 

Note 6   Interest Rate Swap Derivatives 

The Company utilizes interest rate swap
agreements as part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position.  The notional
amount of the interest rate swaps does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties.  The amount exchanged is determined
by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual interest rate swap agreements. 

During May 2011, the Company entered into
two interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $10,000 which were designated as cash flow hedges of certain subordinated
debentures and were determined to be fully effective during all periods presented.  As such, no amount of ineffectiveness
has been included in net income.  Therefore, the aggregate fair value of the swaps is recorded in other liabilities with changes
in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income.  The amount included in accumulated other comprehensive income would
be reclassified to current earnings should the hedges no longer be considered effective. The Company expects the hedges to remain
highly effective during the remaining terms of the swaps. 

Summary information about the interest
rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows: 

The swaps were forward starting and had
effective dates of March 15, 2012 and June 15, 2012. Interest expense recorded on these swap transactions totaled $83 and $93 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and $253 and $279 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and is reported as a component of interest expense in other borrowings. 

If the fair value falls below specified
levels, the Company is required to pledge collateral against these derivative contract liabilities. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company had pledged $3,134 with the counterparty. Under certain circumstances, including a downgrade of its credit rating below
specified levels, the counterparty is required to pledge collateral against these derivative contract liabilities. As of September
30, 2016, no collateral had been pledged by the counterparty. 

Note 7   Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss) 

Other comprehensive income (loss) for the
Company consists of changes in net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities available-for-sale and interest rate swap
derivatives. The following tables present a summary of the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) balances, net of tax,
as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  

(Dollar amounts, except per share amounts, are expressed in
thousands unless otherwise noted) 

Overview  

Southeastern Bank Financial Corporation
(the  Company ) is a Georgia corporation that is a bank holding company registered with the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (the  Federal Reserve ) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the  BHCA ).
Southeastern Bank Financial Corporation (OTCQB: SBFC) trades on OTCQB, the marketplace for companies that are current in their
reporting with a U.S. regulator. Investors can find Real-Time quotes and market information for the Company on   www.otcmarkets.com  . 

The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary,
Georgia Bank   Trust Company of Augusta ( GB T ), primarily does business in the Augusta-Richmond County, GA-SC
metropolitan area. GB T was organized by a group of local citizens and commenced business on August 28, 1989, with one branch
location. Today, it is Augusta s largest community banking company, operating nine full service branches in Augusta, Martinez,
and Evans, Georgia. GB T also operates three full service branches in North Augusta and Aiken, South Carolina under the name
 Southern Bank   Trust, a division of Georgia Bank   Trust Company of Augusta.  Mortgage origination offices
are located in Augusta and Savannah, Georgia and in Aiken, South Carolina. The Company s Operations Center is located in
Martinez, Georgia. 

The Company s primary market includes
Richmond and Columbia Counties in Georgia and Aiken County in South Carolina, all part of the Augusta-Richmond County, GA-SC metropolitan
statistical area (MSA). The Augusta market area has a diversified economy based principally on government, public utilities, health
care, manufacturing, construction, and wholesale and retail trade. Augusta is one of the leading medical centers in the Southeast. 

On June 16, 2016, the Company entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with South State Corporation, a South Carolina corporation
( South State ). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein,
the Company will merge with and into South State (the  Merger ), with South State as the surviving corporation in the
Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Georgia Bank   Trust Company of
Augusta ( Georgia Bank   Trust ), will merge with and into South State s wholly-owned subsidiary bank, South
State Bank (the  Bank Merger ), with South State Bank as the surviving entity in the Bank Merger. As of October 17,
2016, South State received all regulatory approvals for the Merger and the Bank Merger. A special meeting of shareholders of Southeastern
Bank Financial was held on October 18, 2016 where shareholders voted to approve the Merger. The Company expects to complete the
Merger on or around January 3, 2017. 

The Company s
services include the origination of residential and commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, and commercial
and consumer loans. The Company also offers a variety of deposit programs, including noninterest-bearing demand, interest checking,
money management, savings, and time deposits. In its primary market area, the Augusta-Richmond County, GA-SC metropolitan area,
the Company had 19.93% of all deposits and was the second largest depository institution and the largest locally based institution
at June 30, 2016, as cited from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation s ( FDIC ) website. Securities sold
under repurchase agreements are also offered. Additional services include wealth management, trust, retail investment, and mortgage.
As a matter of practice, most mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market; however, some mortgage loans are placed in the portfolio
based on asset/liability management strategies. The Company continues to concentrate on increasing its market share through various
new deposit and loan products and other financial services and by focusing on its customer relationship management philosophy.
The Company is committed to building life-long relationships with its customers, employees, shareholders, and the communities it
serves. 

The Company s primary source of income
is from its lending activities, followed by interest income from its investment activities, service charges and fees on deposits
and gain on sales of mortgage loans in the secondary market. Interest income on loans including loans held for sale increased $348
or 0.99% for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015 and was due to higher average balances
of loans offset by lower yields. Interest income on investment securities increased $172 or 1.51% due to higher yields. Gain on
sales of loans increased $837 or 15.74% due primarily to increased mortgage originations and refinancing activity during the first
nine months of the year. 

Table 1 - Selected Financial Data  

Annualized return on average total assets was 1.00% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease from 1.10% for the same period last year and annualized return on average equity
was 10.31% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease from 12.23% for the same period last year. Net income for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $13,967 compared to $14,761 for the same period in 2015. 

Table 2 highlights significant changes
in the balance sheet at September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015. Total assets increased $35,164 and reflect increases
in cash and equivalents of $52,475 and loans of $27,642. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in investment securities
of $33,118 and a $3,070 decrease in deferred tax asset. Total liabilities increased $16,478 and reflect increases in deposits of
$25,256 and advances from FHLB of $5,000 offset by a $15,134 decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements. Stockholders 
equity increased $18,686 and was due primarily to an increase in retained earnings of $10,722 and an increase in accumulated other
comprehensive income, net of $5,602. 

Table 2 - Selected Balance Sheet Data  

The Company meets its liquidity needs by managing cash and due
from banks, federal funds purchased and sold, maturity of investment securities, principal repayments from mortgage-backed securities,
and draws on lines of credit. Additionally, liquidity can be managed through structuring deposit and loan maturities. The Company
funds loan and investment growth with core deposits, securities sold under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and other wholesale
funding including brokered certificates of deposit. During inflationary periods, interest rates generally increase and operating
expenses generally rise. When interest rates rise, variable rate loans and investments produce higher earnings; however, deposit
and other borrowings interest expense also rise. The Company monitors its interest rate risk as it applies to net interest income
in various simulations up and down 400 basis points (4.00%) and as it applies to economic value of equity in a shock up and down
400 basis points scenario. The Company monitors operating expenses through responsibility center budgeting. 

Forward-Looking Statements  

Southeastern Bank Financial Corporation
may, from time to time, make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in the Company s
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ) and its reports to shareholders. Statements
made in such documents, other than those concerning historical information, should be considered forward-looking and subject to
various risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements are made based upon management s belief as well as assumptions
made by, and information currently available to, management pursuant to  safe harbor  provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company s actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in forward-looking
statements due to a variety of factors, including unanticipated changes in the Company s local economies, the national economy,
governmental monetary and fiscal policies, deposit levels, loan demand, loan collateral values and securities portfolio values;
difficulties in interest rate risk management; the effects of competition in the banking business; difficulties in expanding the
Company s business into new markets; changes in governmental regulation relating to the banking industry, including but not
limited to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III international capital accord; failure
of assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for loan losses, including the value of collateral underlying delinquent
loans; a material delay or inability to obtain regulatory approval of the Merger and meet the other conditions to the Merger; business
disruption due to the proposed Merger; disruptions due to uncertainty or other factors related to the proposed Merger making it
more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, other business partners, or governmental entities; and other
factors. The Company cautions that such factors are not exclusive. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking
statement that may be made from time to time by, or on behalf of, the Company. 

Critical Accounting Estimates  

The accounting and financial reporting
policies of the Company and its subsidiary conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and to general practices within the banking industry. Of these policies, management has identified the allowance for loan losses,
determining the fair values of financial instruments including other real estate owned, interest rate swap derivatives, investment
securities, and other-than-temporary impairment as critical accounting estimates that requires difficult, subjective judgment and
are important to the presentation of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. 

Allowance for Loan Losses  

The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision
for loan losses charged to expense, which affects the Company s earnings directly. Loans are charged against the allowance
for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries are added
to the allowance. The allowance is an amount that reflects management s estimate of the level of probable incurred losses
in the portfolio. Factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance include, but are not limited to:
(1) detailed reviews of individual loans; (2) historical and current trends in loan charge-offs for the various portfolio segments
evaluated; (3) the level of the allowance in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels; (4) levels and trends in non-performing
and past due loans; (5) collateral values of properties securing loans; and (6) management s assessment of economic conditions.
The Company s Board of Directors reviews the recommendations of management regarding the appropriate level for the allowance
for loan losses based upon these factors. 

The provision for loan losses is the charge
to operating earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company has developed policies and procedures
for evaluating the overall quality of its loan portfolio and the timely identification of problem credits. Management continues
to review these policies and procedures and makes further improvements as needed. The adequacy of the Company s allowance
for loan losses and the effectiveness of the Company s internal policies and procedures are also reviewed periodically by
the Company s regulators and the Company s internal loan review personnel. The Company s regulators may advise
the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time
of their examination. Such regulatory guidance is considered, and the Company may recognize additions to the allowance as a result. 

The Company continues to refine the methodology
on which the level of the allowance for loan losses is based by comparing historical loss ratios utilized to actual experience
and by classifying loans for analysis based on similar risk characteristics. Cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal
and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement; however, cash receipts on impaired and nonaccrual loans for which
the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied to principal and interest income depending upon the overall risk of principal
loss to the Company. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

A significant portion of the Company s
assets are financial instruments carried at fair value. This includes securities available-for-sale, loans held for sale, certain
impaired loans, mortgage banking derivatives and other real estate owned. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the percentage
of total assets measured at fair value was 36.17% and 39.16%, respectively. The majority of assets carried at fair value are based
on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. At September 30, 2016, 1.16% of assets measured at fair
value were based on significant unobservable inputs. This consisted primarily of impaired loans and other real estate owned and
represents approximately 0.42% of the Company s total assets. See Note 4  Fair Value Measurements  in the  Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments. 

Other Real Estate Owned  

Assets acquired through or instead of loan
foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These
assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. If fair value declines subsequent
to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Operating costs after acquisition are expensed. Costs related
to the development and improvement of real estate owned are capitalized. 

Interest Rate Swap Derivatives  

The fair value of interest rate swap derivatives
is determined based on discounted cash flow valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date. The fair
value adjustment is included in other liabilities. See Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in the  Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements  herein for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments. 

Investment Securities  

The fair values for available-for-sale securities are generally
based upon quoted market prices or observable market prices for similar instruments. These values take into account recent market
activity as well as other market observable data such as interest rate, spread and prepayment information. When market observable
data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity for certain securities, the valuation of the security
is subjective and may involve substantial judgment. The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each available-for-sale
security that has an unrealized loss for other-than-temporary impairment. An unrealized loss exists when the fair value of an individual
security is less than its amortized cost basis. The primary factors the Company considers in determining whether an impairment
is other-than-temporary are the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which
may influence the operations of the issuer and whether the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it
will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no
securities valued using unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

Results of Operations  

Net income for the first nine months of 2016 was $13,967, a
decrease of $794 or 5.38% compared with net income of $14,761 for the first nine months of 2015. Increases in net interest income,
gain on sales of loans and investment securities gains (losses), net, as well as a reduction in prepayment fees were offset by
increased provision for loan losses and merger-related expenses. 

Total other comprehensive income for the
first nine months of 2016 was $5,602 compared to total other comprehensive income of $1,681 in the first nine months of 2015. The
change was due primarily to an increase in the unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale of $8,454 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period last year which was caused by a decrease in market interest rates and therefore
an increase in the market value of the portfolio. 

Noninterest income increased $2,666 or
18.98% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and resulted primarily
from increases in gain on sales of loans of $837 and investment securities gains (losses), net of $1,418. 

Noninterest expense totaled $36,801 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, an increase of $1,954, or 5.61% compared to the same period ended September 30, 2015. The change was primarily
due to merger-related expenses of $1,598 and an increase in salaries and other personnel expense of $535 partially offset by reduction
in prepayment fees of $955. 

Net Interest Income  

The primary source of earnings for the
Company is net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment
securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing sources of funds, such as deposits and borrowings. The following
table shows the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, annualized average yields earned
and rates paid on those respective balances, and the actual interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated. Average
balances are calculated based on daily balances, yields on non-taxable investments are not reported on a tax equivalent basis and
average balances for loans include nonaccrual loans even though interest was not earned. 

Table 3 - Average Balances, Income and
Expenses, Yields and Rates  

Table 4 - Average Balances, Income and
Expenses, Yields and Rates  

Third Quarter 2016 compared to Third
Quarter 2015:  

Net interest income increased $222 (1.64%)
during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 and resulted from increased interest
on loans offset by decreased interest on investment securities and lower rates paid on deposits. 

Loan interest income increased $446 (3.95%)
in the three month period as compared to the same period in the prior year. The change resulted primarily from a $79,502 increase
in average balances offset by a decrease in yields from 4.70% to 4.51%. Interest on loans held for sale decreased $163 (57.80%)
and resulted from both a $17,523 decrease in average loans and a decrease in yields from 3.21% to 2.72%. 

Interest income on taxable investment securities
decreased $72 or 2.31% and interest income on tax-exempt investment securities decreased $54 or 6.57%. The decreases were due primarily
to decreased volumes. Average taxable investment balances decreased $22,292 or 3.83% and average tax-exempt balances decreased
$6,607 or 5.93%. The average yield on the taxable investment portfolio increased from 2.15% in the third quarter of 2015 to 2.18%
in the third quarter of 2016 while the average yield on the tax-exempt investment portfolio decreased from 2.95% in the third quarter
of 2015 to 2.93% in the third quarter of 2016. 

Total interest income increased $190 (1.22%)
and average yields on interest-earning assets decreased from 3.66% in 2015 to 3.60% in 2016. 

Deposit interest expense decreased $106
(7.35%) in the three month period as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of lower rates paid on
deposits. Due to these reductions and the low interest rate environment, the annualized average rate of interest bearing liabilities
decreased from 0.57% in the third quarter of 2015 to 0.55% in the third quarter of 2016. 

The Company s net interest margin
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 3 basis points to 3.15% compared to 3.18% for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in the net interest margin was due primarily to reduced loan yields. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015:  

Net interest income increased $810 (2.00%)
during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 and resulted from higher levels of
interest earning assets and lower rates paid on deposits. 

Loan interest income increased $540 (1.56%)
in the nine month period as compared to the same period in the prior year. The change resulted primarily from a $63,784 increase
in average loans offset by a decrease in yields from 4.80% to 4.55%. Interest on loans held for sale decreased $192 (32.60%) and
resulted primarily from a $7,448 decrease in average loans and to a lesser degree a decrease in yields from 3.13% to 2.99%. 

Interest income on taxable investment securities
increased $49 or 0.54% and interest income on tax-exempt investment securities increased $123 or 5.44%. The increases were due
primarily to yields for taxable securities and volume for tax-exempt securities. Average taxable investment balances decreased
$9,254 or 1.64% and average tax-exempt balances increased $6,493 or 6.35%. The average yield on the taxable investment portfolio
increased from 2.16% in 2015 to 2.20% in 2016 and the average yield on the tax-exempt investment portfolio decreased from 2.95%
in 2015 to 2.92% in 2016. 

Total interest income increased $626 (1.34%)
and average yields on interest-earning assets decreased from 3.74% in 2015 to 3.63% in 2016. 

Deposit interest expense decreased $258
(5.93%) in the nine month period as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of lower rates paid on
deposits offset in part by an increase in average deposits of $4,767. Due to these reductions and the low interest rate environment,
the annualized average rate of interest bearing liabilities decreased from 0.60% in 2015 to 0.56% in 2016. 

The Company s net interest margin
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 7 basis points to 3.17% compared to 3.24% for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in the net interest margin was due primarily to reduced loan yields. 

Changes in net interest income from period to period result
from increases or decreases in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, increases or decreases in
the average rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities, the ability to manage the earning asset portfolio, and the availability
of particular sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits. 

The following tables present the extent
to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have impacted
the Company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category
with respect to changes attributable to change in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior rate), changes attributable to change
in rate (change in rate multiplied by prior volume), and changes in rate/volume (change in rate multiplied by change in volume).

Provision for Loan Losses  

The provision for loan losses is the charge to operating earnings
necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which, in management s estimate, is adequate to cover the
estimated amount of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. A provision for loan losses totaling $93 was recognized for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $132 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and a provision of $561
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a credit for loan losses of $2,011 for the same period in 2015. See  Allowance
for Loan Losses  for further analysis of the provision for loan losses. 

Noninterest Income  

Table 7 - Noninterest Income  

Third Quarter 2016 compared to Third
Quarter 2015:  

Noninterest income increased $277 (5.22%)
during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The change was mostly due to an
increase in investment securities gains (losses), net of $209 (126.67%). In addition, retail investment income increased $91 (15.45%)
and gain on sales of loans increased $80 (3.99%). 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015:  

Noninterest income increased $2,666 (18.98%) during the nine
month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The change was mostly due to an increase in investment
securities gains (losses), net of $1,418 (141.09%) and gain on sales of loans of $837 (15.74%). 

Noninterest Expense  

Table 8 - Noninterest Expense  

Third Quarter 2016 compared to Third
Quarter 2015:  

Noninterest expense increased $583 (5.04%)
during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was mainly due to merger-related
expenses of $541 (100.00%) from the South State Merger announced in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, data processing expense
increased $111 (27.48%) due to increased investment in technology and was offset by a $113 decrease in marketing and business development
expense. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015:  

Noninterest expense increased $1,954 (5.61%) during the nine
month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was mainly due to merger-related expenses
of $1,598 (100.00%) from the South State Merger announced in the second quarter of 2016, salaries and other personnel expense which
increased $535 (2.68%) due to salary increases and increased retirement, incentive and other benefit plan costs and higher commission
expense offset by reduction in prepayment fees of $955 (100.00%) due to the penalty incurred on the repayment of an FHLB advance
during the second quarter of 2015. In addition, data processing expense increased $331 (28.03%) due to increased investment in
technology. 

Income Taxes  

The Company recognized income tax expense
of $2,326 and $6,741 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to an income tax expense of $2,277 and
$6,997 for the same periods in 2015. The effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 32.77%
and 32.55% compared to 31.88% and 32.16% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The primary reason for the increase
in the effective tax rate as compared to the same periods in 2015 is due to the non-deductibility of certain merger-related transaction
costs partially offset by higher levels of tax exempt interest income and an increase in state tax credits utilized. 

Loans  

The following table presents the composition
of the Company s loan portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Table 9 - Loan Portfolio Composition  

At September 30, 2016, 77.20% of the loan
portfolio is comprised of real estate loans. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans comprise 20.86%, and consumer loans comprise
1.94% of the portfolio. 

Commercial real estate ( CRE ) comprises 36.83%
of the loan portfolio and consists of both non-owner occupied and owner occupied properties, where the operations of the commercial
entity provide the necessary cash flow to service the debt. For this portion of the real estate loan portfolio, repayment is generally
not dependent upon the sale of the real estate held as collateral. Acquisition, development and construction ( ADC )
loans comprise 16.24% of the loan portfolio. The Company carefully monitors the loans in this category since the repayment of these
loans is generally dependent upon the sale of the real estate in the normal course of business and can be impacted by national
and local economic conditions. The residential category, 24.13% of the portfolio, represents those loans that the Company chooses
to maintain in its portfolio rather than selling into the secondary market for marketing and competitive reasons and commercial
loans secured by residential real estate. 

The Company has no large loan concentrations
to individual borrowers. Unsecured loans at September 30, 2016 totaled $33,991. 

Interest reserves are established for certain
ADC loans and certain CRE loans with major renovations based on the feasibility of the project, the timeframe for completion, the
creditworthiness of the borrower and guarantors, and collateral. An interest reserve allows the borrower s interest cost
to be capitalized and added to the loan balance. As a matter of practice GB T does not generally establish loan funded interest
reserves on ADC or CRE loans; however, the Company s loan portfolio includes six loans with interest reserves at September
30, 2016. The following table details the loans and accompanying interest reserves as of September 30, 2016. 

These ADC and CRE loans have not been renewed
or restructured and, as of September 30, 2016, are not on nonaccrual. 

Underwriting for ADC and CRE loans with
interest reserves follows the same process as those loans without reserves. In order for GB T to establish a loan-funded interest
reserve, the borrower must have the ability to repay without the use of a reserve and a history of developing and stabilizing similar
properties. All ADC and CRE loans, including those with interest reserves, are carefully monitored through periodic construction
site inspections by bank employees or third party inspectors to ensure projects are moving along as planned. Management assesses
the appropriateness of the use of interest reserves during the entire term of the loan as well as the adequacy of the reserve.
Collateral inspections are completed before approval of advances. 

Loan Review and Classification Process  

The Company maintains a loan review and
classification process which involves multiple officers of the Company and is designed to assess the general quality of credit
underwriting and to promote early identification of potential problem loans. All loan officers are charged with the responsibility
of risk rating all loans in their portfolios and updating the ratings, positively or negatively, on an ongoing basis as conditions
warrant. Risk ratings are selected from an 8-point scale with ratings as follows: ratings 1- 4 Satisfactory (pass), rating 5 Watch
(potential weakness), rating 6 Substandard (well-defined weakness), rating 7 Doubtful and rating 8 Loss. 

When a loan officer originates a new loan,
he or she documents the credit file with an offering sheet summary, supplemental underwriting analyses, relevant financial information
and if applicable, collateral evaluations. All of this information is used in the determination of the initial loan risk rating.
Then, the Company s Credit Administration department undertakes an independent credit review of that relationship in order
to validate the lending officer s rating. Lending relationships with total related exposure of $500 or greater are also placed
into a tracking database and reviewed by Credit Administration personnel on an annual basis in conjunction with the receipt of
updated borrower and guarantor financial information. The individual loan reviews analyze such items as: loan type; nature, type
and estimated value of collateral; borrower and/or guarantor estimated financial strength; most recently available financial information;
related loans and total borrower exposure; and current/anticipated performance of the loan. The results of such reviews are presented
to Executive Management. 

Through the review of delinquency reports, updated financial
statements or other relevant information in the normal course of business, the lending officer and/or Credit Administration review
personnel may determine that a loan relationship has weakened to the point that a criticized (loan grade 5) or classified (loan
grade 6 through 8) status is warranted. When a loan relationship with total related exposure of $200 or greater is adversely graded
(5 or above), the lending officer is then charged with preparing a Classified/Watch report which outlines the background of the
credit problem, current repayment status of the loans, current collateral evaluation and a workout plan of action. This plan may
include goals to improve the credit rating, assisting the borrower in moving the loans to another institution and/or collateral
liquidation. All such Classified/Watch reports are reviewed on a quarterly basis by members of Executive Management at a regularly
scheduled meeting in which each lending officer presents the workout plans for their criticized credit relationships. 

Depending upon the individual facts, circumstances and the result
of the Classified/Watch review process, Executive Management may categorize the loan relationship as impaired. Once that determination
has occurred, Executive Management in conjunction with Credit Administration personnel, will complete an evaluation of the collateral
(for collateral-dependent loans) based upon appraisals on file adjusting for current market conditions and other local factors
that may affect collateral value. This subjective evaluation may produce an initial specific allowance for placement in the Company s
Allowance for Loan Losses calculation. As soon as practical, updated appraisals on the collateral backing that impaired loan relationship
are ordered. When the updated appraisals are received, Executive Management with assistance from Credit Administration department
personnel reviews the appraisal, and updates the specific allowance analysis for each loan relationship accordingly. The Director s
Loan Committee reviews on a quarterly basis the Classified/Watch reports including changes in credit grades of 5 or higher as well
as all impaired loans, the related allowances and other real estate owned ( OREO ). 

In general, once the specific allowance
has been finalized, Executive Management will authorize a charge-off prior to the following calendar quarter-end in which that
reserve calculation is finalized. 

The review process also provides for the
upgrade of loans that show improvement since the last review. 

Nonperforming Assets  

Non-performing assets include nonaccrual
loans, restructured loans, and other real estate owned. Table 10 shows the current and prior period amounts of non-performing assets.
Non-performing assets were $17,482 at September 30, 2016, compared to $17,766 at December 31, 2015 and $13,966 at September 30,
2015. The change from September 2015 to September 2016 was due primarily to a $2,456 decrease in restructured loans and a net increase
of $6,056 in nonaccrual loans. 

There were no loans past due 90 days or
more and still accruing interest at September 30, 2016 and 2015. At December 31, 2015 there were $127 of loans past due 90 days
or more and still accruing interest. 

Troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are troubled loans in which
the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower and either principal or interest has been forgiven due to deterioration
in the borrower s financial condition. There was $7,460 in TDRs at September 30, 2016, of which $6,534 were on nonaccrual
status. TDRs totaled $8,636 at December 31, 2015, of which $5,274 were on nonaccrual status, and $8,851 at September 30, 2015,
of which $5,469 were on nonaccrual status. 

Table 10 - Non-Performing Assets  

(1) Restructured loans on nonaccrual status at period end are
included under nonaccrual loans in the table. 

The ratio of non-performing assets to total
loans and other real estate was 1.69% at September 30, 2016 compared to 1.76% at December 31, 2015 and 1.45% at September 30, 2015.
The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total nonaccrual loans was 131.25% at September 30, 2016 compared to 152.14% at December
31, 2015 and 216.94% at September 30, 2015. The resolution of non-performing assets continues to be a priority of management. 

Nonaccrual loans increased $6,056 (59.23%)
from September 30, 2015 due primarily to an increase in nonaccrual CRE loans, which increased $7,267. Partially offsetting this
increase was a decrease in nonaccrual ADC loans of $1,877. 

The increase in nonaccrual CRE was due to one troubled loan
that moved to nonaccrual status during the last half of the 2015 and one impaired loan that moved to nonaccrual status during the
third quarter of 2016. The decrease in restructured loans since September 30, 2015 was due primarily to the repayment of a $2,423
restructured loan. 

The following table provides further information
regarding the Company s most significant nonaccrual loans. 

Table 11 - Nonaccrual Loans  

The following table presents a roll forward
of other real estate owned for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Table 12 - Other Real Estate Owned  

The following table provides details of
other real estate owned as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively. 

In the first nine months of 2016, additions to other real estate
owned totaled $303 compared to $611 for the same period in 2015. There was $279 in sales of other real estate for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,460 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Allowance for Loan Losses  

The allowance for loan losses represents
an allocation for the estimated amount of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan
losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans, with particular emphasis on impaired, non-accruing,
past due, and other loans that management believes require special attention. The determination of the allowance for loan losses
is considered a critical accounting estimate of the Company. See  Critical Accounting Estimates.  

While management uses available information
to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition,
various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company s allowance
for loan losses. Such agencies may advise additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them
at the time of their examination. Such regulatory guidance is considered, and the Company may recognize additions to the allowance
as a result. 

Additions to the allowance for loan losses
are made periodically to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based upon management s analysis of risk in the loan
portfolio. Loans determined to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance for loan losses and subsequent recoveries are added
to the allowance. A provision for losses in the amount of $93 was charged to expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to a provision of $132 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and a $561 provision for losses was charged to expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a negative provision of $2,011 credited to expense for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. 

At September 30, 2016 the ratio of allowance
for loan losses to period end loans was 2.06% compared to 2.12% at December 31, 2015 and 2.30% at September 30, 2015. The decline
in the overall level of allowance as a percentage of the portfolio is due in part to the decline in the average historical loss
rate and the level of recoveries during the quarter. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 charge-offs net
of recoveries totaled $560 on all loans. This included charge-offs net of recoveries of $305 for consumer loans, 206 for ADC loans,
$126 for residential real estate loans and $31 for commercial, financial and agricultural loans. These were partially offset by
recoveries net of charge-offs of $108 for CRE loans. The provisions for loan losses allocated to individual portfolio segments
are affected by the calculation of average historical net loss rate factors and by the internal and external qualitative factors
within each category. 

Management considers the current allowance
for loan losses appropriate based upon its analysis of risk in the portfolio using the methods previously discussed. Management s
judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about events which are believed to be reasonable, but which may or may not prove
correct. While it is the Company s policy to charge off in the current period the loans in which a loss is considered probable,
there are additional risks of losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to a particular loan or class of loans.
Because management evaluates such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, historical loss rates, overall
portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions and trends that may affect a borrower s
ability to repay, management's judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise. Thus, there
can be no assurance that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases
in the allowance will not be required. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company has maintained adequate liquidity
to meet operating and loan funding requirements. The loan to deposit ratio at September 30, 2016 was 66.70% compared to 66.00%
at December 31, 2015 and 62.45% at September 30, 2015. Deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 include $136,605 and
$159,180 of brokered certificates of deposit, respectively. GB T has also utilized borrowings from the FHLB. GB T maintains
a line of credit with the FHLB approximating 10% of its total assets. FHLB advances are collateralized by eligible first mortgage
loans and CRE loans. FHLB advances totaled $90,000 at September 30, 2016. GB T maintains repurchase lines of credit with SunTrust
Robinson Humphrey, Atlanta, Georgia, for advances up to $30,000, of which none was outstanding at September 30, 2016 and a $10,000
repurchase line of credit with CenterState Bank, Orlando, Florida, of which none was outstanding at September 30, 2016. GB T
has a federal funds purchased accommodation with SunTrust Bank, Atlanta, Georgia for advances up to $10,000, of which none was
outstanding at September 30, 2016 and a federal funds purchased accommodation with CenterState Bank, Orlando, Florida, for advances
up to $10,000, of which none was outstanding at September 30, 2016. The Company also maintains a borrowing facility at the Federal
Reserve Bank, under the Borrower-In-Custody Program, of which none was outstanding at September 30, 2016. Additionally, liquidity
needs can be supplemented by the structuring of the maturities of investment securities and the pricing and maturities on loans
and deposits offered to customers. The Company also uses retail securities sold under repurchase agreements to fund operations.
Retail securities sold under repurchase agreements were $550 at September 30, 2016. 

Stockholders  equity to total assets was 10.06% at September
30, 2016 compared to 9.23% at December 31, 2015 and 9.31% at September 30, 2015. The capital of the Company exceeded all required
regulatory guidelines at September 30, 2016. The Company s common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based and
Tier 1 leverage capital ratios were 14.19%, 15.73%, 16.99%, and 10.91%, respectively, at September 30, 2016. 

The following table reflects the current
regulatory capital levels in more detail, including comparisons to the regulatory minimums. 

Table 13 - Regulatory Capital Requirements  

  September 30, 2016  

(1) Risk-based capital includes a capital conservation buffer
of 0.625%. 

Georgia Bank   Trust Company is regulated
by the Department of Banking and Finance of the State of Georgia (DBF). The DBF requires that state banks in Georgia generally
maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of four and one-half percent (4.50%). 

On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve and
the FDIC approved rules that implement the  Basel III  regulatory capital reforms, as well as certain changes required
by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which
is in addition to the Tier 1, common equity Tier 1 and total risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer is
being phased in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, with a maximum buffer of 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016,
1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. Failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer
will result in limitations on capital distributions and on discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Based on the Company s
current capital composition and levels, management does not presently anticipate that the rules present a material risk to the
Company s financial condition or results of operations. 

Except as set forth above, management is not aware of any other
events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company s liquidity, capital resources
or operations. 

Commitments
and Contractual Obligations   

The Company is party to lines of credit
with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. Lines of credit are
unfunded commitments to extend credit. These instruments involve, in varying degrees, exposure to credit and interest rate risk
in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance
by the other party to the financial instrument for unfunded commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by
the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company evaluates ADC loans for the percentage completed before extending additional
credit. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments and contractual obligations as it does for on-balance
sheet instruments. 

Unfunded commitments to extend credit where
contractual amounts represent potential credit risk totaled $253,231 at September 30, 2016. This includes standby letters of credit
of $4,732 at September 30, 2016. These commitments are primarily at variable interest rates. 

The Company s commitments are funded
through internal funding sources of scheduled repayments of loans and sales and maturities of investment securities available-for-sale
or external funding sources through acceptance of deposits from customers or borrowings from other financial institutions. 

The following table is a summary of the
Company s commitments to extend credit, commitments under contractual leases as well as the Company s contractual obligations,
consisting of deposits, FHLB advances, which are subject to early termination options, borrowed funds and benefit plans by contractual
maturity date. 

Table 14 - Commitments and Contractual
Obligations  

(1)  Presented at contractual amounts; however, since many
of these are expected to expire unused or partially used, the total amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 

Although management regularly monitors
the balance of outstanding commitments to fund loans to ensure funding availability should the need arise, management believes
that the risk of all customers fully drawing on all these lines of credit at the same time is remote. 

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices  

Inflation generally increases the cost
of funds and operating overhead, and to the extent loans and other assets bear variable rates, the yields on such assets. Unlike
most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a
result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects
of general levels of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction and to the same extent as
the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. In addition, inflation
can increase a financial institution's cost of goods and services purchased, the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense
and similar items. Inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans
held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings, and stockholders' equity. Mortgage originations and refinances tend to slow
as interest rates increase, and can reduce the Company's earnings from such activities and the income from the sale of residential
mortgage loans in the secondary market. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

As of September 30, 2016, there were no
substantial changes in the interest rate sensitivity analysis or the sensitivity of market value of portfolio equity for various
changes in interest rates calculated as of December 31, 2015. A detailed discussion of market risk is provided in the Company s
2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

As of the end of the period covered by
this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management,
including the Company s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and its Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, such officers concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including
its consolidated subsidiary) that is required to be included in the Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. There have been no changes in the Company s internal controls or, to the Company s knowledge, in other
factors during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 

Part II  

  OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings  

There are no material pending legal
proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their property is subject. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors  

In addition to the other information
set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which could materially affect its business,
financial condition or future results. There are no material changes from the factors previously disclosed in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional
risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems to be immaterial also may materially
adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  

The following table sets forth
information regarding the Company s purchases of its common stock on a monthly basis during the third quarter of 2016. 

(1) On October 15, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors announced the commencement of a stock repurchase program (the  2014 Program ), pursuant to which it will, from time to time, repurchase up to 300,000 shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market or in private transactions. The 2014 Program does not have a stated expiration date.
