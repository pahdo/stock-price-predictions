ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  

     NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

  (Unaudited)  

1.
Nature of Operations  

Mexco
Energy Corporation (a Colorado corporation) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Forman Energy Corporation (a New York corporation),
Southwest Texas Disposal Corporation (a Texas corporation) and TBO Oil   Gas, LLC (a Texas limited liability company) (collectively,
the  Company ) are engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and
natural gas liquids ( NGLs ). Most of the Company s oil and gas interests are centered in West Texas; however,
the Company owns producing properties and undeveloped acreage in thirteen states. Although most of the Company s oil and
gas interests are operated by others, the Company operates several properties in which it owns an interest.  

2.
Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies  

Principles
of Consolidation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mexco Energy Corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions associated with the consolidated operations have been eliminated.  

Estimates
and Assumptions . In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, management is required to make informed judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates are used in determining proved oil and gas reserves. Although
management believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The
estimate of the Company s oil and natural gas reserves, which is used to compute depreciation, depletion, amortization and
impairment of oil and gas properties, is the most significant of the estimates and assumptions that affect these reported results.  

Interim
Financial Statements.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all
adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as
of September 30, 2016, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the interim periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.
The financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are
unaudited. The consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 was derived from the audited balance sheet filed in the Company s
2016 annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The results of operations
for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year. The accounting policies
followed by the Company are set forth in more detail in Note 2 of the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
in the Form 10-K. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted in this Form 10-Q
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. However, the disclosures herein are adequate to make the information presented
not misleading. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
thereto included in the Form 10-K.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements.  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) , which is intended to reduce diversity in practice
in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues
for which current GAAP is either unclear or does not include specific guidance. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the
amendments are adopted in the same period. This guidance must be adopted using a retrospective transition method. The Company
is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this guidance will have on its cash flows.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting . The amendment is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU No. 2016-09 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU No. 2016-09 on the consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Topic 842 Leases, which requires companies to recognize a right of use asset and related
liability on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations arising from leases with durations greater than 12 months. The standard
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted.
We are currently evaluating the effect the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends existing requirements on the classification and measurement of
financial instruments. The standard principally affects accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities where the
fair value option has been elected. The guidance is effective for fiscal periods after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
thereafter. Early adoption of certain provisions is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect the new guidance will have
on our financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Topic 740 Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes which requires
all deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be presented as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Currently, entities
are required to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified balance
sheet. The new standard will become effective for Mexco beginning on April 1, 2017, with the option to early adopt, and can be
applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our results of operations
or cash flows. The reclassification of amounts from current to noncurrent could affect the presentation of our balance sheet.  

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU provides guidance concerning
the recognition and measurement of revenue from contracts with customers. The effective date for ASU 2014-09 was delayed through
the issuance of ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers   Deferral of the Effective Date, to annual and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is required to be adopted using either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition
method, with early adoption permitted in 2017. Additionally, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net), which clarifies the implementation
guidance on principal versus agent considerations on such matters. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying performance obligations and licensing, which clarifies guidance related to identifying
performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in the new revenue recognition standard. In May 2016,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients,
which addresses narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectibility, non-cash consideration, and completed contracts at
transition. Additionally, the amendments in this update provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition
and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers.
Management is evaluating the effect, if any, this pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements.  

3.
Asset Retirement Obligations   

The
Company s asset retirement obligations ( ARO ) relate to the plugging of wells, the removal of facilities and
equipment, and site restoration on oil and gas properties. The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded in the period
in which it is incurred, discounted to its present value using the credit adjusted risk-free interest rate, and a corresponding
amount capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted each period, and
the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The ARO is included in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets with the current portion being included in the accounts payable and other accrued expenses.  

The
following table provides a rollforward of the AROs for the first six months of fiscal 2017:  

4.
Stock-based Compensation   

The
Company recognized compensation expense of $13,085 and $30,648 in general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Compensation expense recognized for the six
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $31,686 and $71,897, respectively. The total cost related to non-vested awards not
yet recognized at September 30, 2016 totals approximately $46,967 which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of
1.51 years.  

The
following table is a summary of activity of stock options for the six months ended September 30, 2016:  

There
were no options granted during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Outstanding
options at September 30, 2016 expire between August 2020 and August 2024 and have exercise prices ranging from $5.98 to $7.00.  

5.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments    

Fair
value as defined by authoritative literature is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
(exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are classified
and disclosed in one of the following categories:  

Level
1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.  

Level
2   Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments
in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are
observable.  

Level
3   Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.  

Financial
assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  

The
carrying amount reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable approximates fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.  

The
fair value amount reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for long term debt approximates fair value because
the actual interest rates do not significantly differ from current rates offered for instruments with similar characteristics
and is deemed to use Level 2 inputs. See the Company s Note 6 on Credit Facility for further discussion.  

6.
Credit Facility   

The
Company has a loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the  Agreement ), which provided for a credit facility of
$5,570,000 with no monthly commitment reductions and a borrowing base to be evaluated on July 30 and January 1 of each year or
at any additional time in the Bank s discretion. The borrowing base is reset to the extent the Company sells or otherwise
disposes of any of its oil and gas properties. The Company is required to pay 100% of such net proceeds to the lender resulting
in a permanent reduction of the borrowing base. Amounts borrowed under the Agreement are collateralized by the common stock of
the Company s wholly owned subsidiaries and substantially all of the Company s oil and gas properties.  

The
Agreement was renewed ten times with the tenth amendment effective as of March 31, 2016 with a maturity date of November 30, 2020.
The revised borrowing base as of June 20, 2016 was set at $5,570,000. Under such renewal agreement, interest on the facility accrues
at an annual rate equal to the British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate ( BBA LIBOR ) daily floating
rate, plus 3.0 percentage points, which was 3.522% on September 30, 2016. Interest on the outstanding amount under the credit
agreement is payable monthly. There was no availability of this line of credit at September 30, 2016. No principal payments are
anticipated to be required through November 30, 2020.  

The
Agreement contains customary covenants for credit facilities of this type including limitations on change in control, disposition
of assets, mergers and reorganizations. The Company is also obligated to meet certain financial covenants under the Agreement
and requires minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) of $100,000 for the
two fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2016, $300,000 for the three fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2016, $500,000 for the
four fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2017 and $650,000 for each trailing fiscal quarter period thereafter and minimum interest
coverage ratios (EBITDA/Interest Expense) of 2.00 to 1.00 for each quarter thereafter. The Company is in compliance with all covenants
as of September 30, 2016.  

In
addition, this Agreement prohibits the Company from paying cash dividends on its common stock. The Agreement does grant the Company
permission to enter into hedge agreements however, it is under no obligation to do so.  

The
Agreement allows for up to $500,000 of the facility to be used for outstanding letters of credit. As of September 30, 2016, one
letter of credit for $50,000, in lieu of plugging bond with the Texas Railroad Commission ( TRRC ) covering the properties
the Company operates is outstanding under the facility. This letter of credit renews annually. The Company will pay a fee in an
amount equal to 1 percent (1.0%) per annum of the outstanding undrawn amount of each standby letter of credit, payable monthly
in arrears, on the basis of the face amount outstanding on the day the fee is calculated.  

The
balance outstanding on the line of credit as of September 30, 2016 was $5,520,000. The following table is a summary of activity
on the Bank of America, N.A. line of credit for the six months ended September 30, 2016:  

7.
Income Taxes   

A
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is recognized when it is more likely than not that
some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To assess that likelihood, we use estimates and judgment
regarding our future taxable income, and we consider the tax consequences in the jurisdiction where such taxable income is generated,
to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence can include our current financial position, our results
of operations, both actual and forecasted, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies as well as the
current and forecasted business economics of our industry.  

Based
on the material write-downs of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties during fiscal 2016, we project being in
a net deferred tax asset position at March 31, 2017. Our deferred tax asset is $1,043,089 as of September 30, 2016 with a valuation
amount of $1,043,089. We believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses
the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit
the use of deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates
of future taxable income are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer
present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as future expected growth.  

The
income tax provision consists of the following for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

8.
Related Party Transactions    

Related
party transactions for the Company relate to shared office expenditures in addition to administrative and operating expenses paid
on behalf of the majority stockholder. The total billed to and reimbursed by the stockholder for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 was $6,852 and $24,080, respectively.  

The
total billed to and reimbursed by the stockholder for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $12,495 and $49,701,
respectively.  

9.
Loss Per Common Share   

The
Company s basic net loss per share has been computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted net loss per share assumes the exercise of all stock options having exercise prices less than the average
market price of the common stock during the period using the treasury stock method. In periods where losses are reported, the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes potential common shares, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  

The
following is a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the
three and six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Due
to a net loss for the for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding excludes common stock equivalents because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  

10.
Impairments of Oil and Natural Gas Properties   

Our
oil and natural gas properties are subject to quarterly full cost ceiling tests. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less
accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of
estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing
and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. Estimated future net revenues for the quarterly ceiling
limit are calculated using the average of commodity prices on the first day of the month over the trailing 12-month period. In
the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling, resulting
in an impairment in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties of approximately $834,000. We did not have an impairment
in the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties for the six months ended September 30, 2016.  

11.
Subsequent Events    

On
October 7, 2016, the Company received approximately $2.187 million in cash from a sale of working interests to Parsley Energy,
Inc. covering 50 net acres located in Glasscock County, Texas in the horizontal Wolfcamp trend of the Permian Basin in West Texas.
Of these proceeds, approximately $1.887 million was applied to the Company s bank debt and the balance added to working
capital of the Company.  

Effective
November 1, 2016, the Company sold its 100% working interest (76.7% average net revenue interest) in eight oil and gas wells and
one disposal well of which Mexco is operator, located in the El Cinco and Tippett Fields of Pecos County, Texas. The Company received
a cash purchase price of $405,000 which has been applied to reduce bank indebtedness. These properties have been determined by
management to be non-core with limited potential for further development.  

The Company applied a total of $2,292.000
from the proceeds of these two sales to the line of credit reducing its bank indebtedness to $3,228,000 as of November 10, 2016.

Cautionary
Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations ( MD A ) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the  Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our plans, beliefs or current expectations
and may be signified by the words  could ,  should ,  expect ,  project ,  estimate ,
 believe ,  anticipate ,  intend ,  budget ,  plan ,  forecast ,
 predict  and other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements appear throughout this Form 10-Q with respect
to, among other things: profitability; planned capital expenditures; estimates of oil and gas production; future project dates;
estimates of future oil and gas prices; estimates of oil and gas reserves; our future financial condition or results of operations;
and our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.  

While
we have made assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the assumptions that support our forward-looking statements are based
upon information that is currently available and is subject to change. All forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q are qualified
in their entirety by the cautionary statement contained in this section. We do not undertake to update, revise or correct any
of the forward-looking information. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Form 10-K.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources.  Historically, we have funded our operations, acquisitions, exploration and development expenditures
from cash generated by operating activities, bank borrowings and issuance of common stock. Our primary financial resource is our
base of oil and gas reserves. We pledge our producing oil and gas properties to secure our revolving line of credit. We do not
have any delivery commitments to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of its oil and gas under any existing contract or agreement.  

Due
to depressed commodity price environment, we are applying financial discipline to all aspects of our business. Our ability to
grow, make capital expenditures and service our debt depends primarily upon the prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and
NGL we sell. Substantial expenditures are required to replace reserves, sustain production and fund our business plans. The substantial
decline in oil and natural gas prices has negatively affected the amount of cash we have available for capital expenditures and
debt service. In order to meet obligations, we may continue to sell non-core assets, if necessary.  

Our
long term strategy is on increasing profit margins while concentrating on obtaining reserves with low cost operations by acquiring
and developing oil and gas properties with potential for long-lived production. We focus our efforts on the acquisition of royalties
and working interests, non-operated properties in areas with significant development potential.  

For
the first six months of fiscal 2017, cash flow from operations was $140,297, a 55% decrease when compared to the corresponding
period of fiscal 2016. Cash of $268,077 was used for additions to oil and gas properties, cash of $89,272 was used to settle asset
retirement obligations, cash of $75,808 was received for drilling refunds, net cash proceeds of $193,846 were received from the
sale of assets and $60,000 was used to reduce the line of credit. Accordingly, net cash decreased $7,398.  

At
September 30, 2016, we had working capital of $5,408 compared to working capital of $23,150 at March 31, 2016, a decrease of $17,742
for the reasons set forth below.  

Oil
and Natural Gas Property Transactions   

Pioneer
Natural Resources Company has drilled seven wells which are producing in Upton County, Texas, all being horizontal wells with
10,000 feet of laterals at no expense to Mexco. These wells are located in part on 411 acres in which Mexco has retained a 1%
overriding royalty interest. On July 15, 2016, Pioneer exercised its option by paying to the Company $90,000 to extend for an
additional two years on the undeveloped portion of Mexco s leasehold interest in 60 net acres (200 gross acres) in Upton
County, Texas.  

In
July 2016, we participated in the drilling of a horizontal development well in the Cedar Canyon Bone Spring Wolfcamp formation
of Eddy County, New Mexico. The lease, operated by BC Operating, Inc., contains approximately 320 acres with one already producing
well. Initial production results for the new well averaged 465 barrels of oil and 5,000,000 cubic feet of gas per day. Mexco s
working interest in this lease is .926% (.695% net revenue interest). Our share of the costs to drill and complete this well through
September 30, 2016 was approximately $81,000.  

During
the first six months of fiscal 2017, Mexco participated with various percentage interests in seven horizontal wells in the Delaware
Basin located in the western portion of the Permian Basin in Lea County, New Mexico with aggregate costs to date of $213,250.  

One
of these wells was tested in August 2016 out of the horizontal portion of 5,384 feet in length of the well bore at a total vertical
depth of 9,061 feet at a rate of 1,313 barrels of oil, 1,988 barrels of water and 1,920,000 cubic feet of gas per day, or 1,633
barrels of oil equivalent per day, with a flowing tubing pressure of 660 pounds per square inch, on a 64/64 inch choke and 39%
of fracture load recovered. Mexco s working interest in this well is .578% (.47% net revenue interest).  

A
second well was tested in August 2016 at the rate of 834 barrels of oil, 2,328 barrels of water and 1,571,000 cubic feet of gas
per day, or 1,096 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with a flowing tubing pressure of 530 pounds per square inch, on a 50/64
inch choke with 21% of fracture load recovered. Mexco s working interest in this well is .746% (.597% net revenue interest).  

The
remaining five of these seven wells are in various stages of drilling, completion and production with possible further costs to
be incurred by Mexco. The results of these tests are neither indicative of future sustained production rates nor of results to
be expected in other wells.  

Also,
during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Mexco sold its interest in a non-core oil and gas property located in Martin County,
Texas for $60,000 which was used to reduce the balance of Mexco s line of credit.  

In
connection with Barnett Shale Fort Worth Basin royalties owned by the Company, a settlement was reached with the defendants, Chesapeake
Energy Corporation and Total E P USA underpayment of royalties resulting in a payment of $154,289 of which $123,394 was paid
in cash on August 19, 2016 and the balance of $30,894 in an interest free promissory note due in three years and payable by Chesapeake.  

We
are participating in other projects and are reviewing projects in which we may participate. The cost of such projects would be
funded, to the extent possible, from existing cash balances, cash flow from operations and sales of non-core assets.  

Crude
oil and natural gas prices have remained significantly depressed during the last year. Lower product prices reduce our cash flow
from operations and diminish the present value of our oil and gas reserves. Lower product prices also offer us less incentive
to assume the drilling risks that are inherent in our business. The volatility of the energy markets makes it extremely difficult
to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. For example in the last twelve months, the NYMEX WTI
posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of $22.75 per bbl in February 2016 to a high of $47.75 per bbl in June 2016.
The Henry Hub Spot Market Price ( Henry Hub ) for natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.49 per MMBtu in March 2016
to a high of $3.19 per MMBtu in September 2016. On September 30, 2016 the WTI posted price for crude oil was $44.75 per bbl and
the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was $2.84 per MMBtu. These are at a level not seen since 2003.  

Contractual
Obligations.  We have no off-balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and have not guaranteed the debt of any other party.
The following table summarizes our future payments we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of September 30, 2016:  

(1)
       
      These
    amounts represent the balances outstanding under the bank line of credit. This repayment assumes that interest will be paid
    on a monthly basis, no additional funds will be drawn and does not include estimated interest of $194,427 less than 1 year,
    $583,280 1-3 years and $32,404 over 3 years.   

(2)
       
      The
    lease amount represents the monthly rent amount for our principal office space in Midland, Texas under one three year lease
    agreement effective April 1, 2013 which was extended for an additional two years and a second three year lease agreement effective
    April 1, 2014. The total obligation for the remainder of the leases is $44,600 which includes $13,859 billed to and reimbursed
    by our majority shareholder for his portion of the shared office space.    

Results
of Operations   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015.  There was a
net loss of $237,902 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $776,307 for the quarter ended September
30, 2015. This was primarily a result of an increase in other operating revenue and a decrease in operating expenses partially
offset by a decrease in oil and gas revenues.  

Oil
and gas sales.  Revenue from oil and gas sales was $546,164 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, a 24% decrease from $720,874
for the same period of fiscal 2016. This resulted from a decrease in oil and gas prices and oil and gas production.  

Other
operating revenue.  Other operating revenue was $34,678 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $7,955 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the three year note portion of the settlement of a lawsuit for underpayment
of royalties from Chesapeake Energy Corporation and Total E P USA in the amount of $25,219.  

Production
and exploration.  Production costs were $226,548 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, a 21% decrease from $284,995 for the
same period of fiscal 2016. This was primarily the result of a decrease in lease operating expenses and production taxes as a
result of the decrease in oil and gas revenues.   

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $297,370 for the second quarter of fiscal
2017, a 34% decrease from $450,648 for the same period of fiscal 2016, primarily due to a decrease in oil and gas production and
a decrease in the full cost pool amortization base partially offset by an increase in oil reserves.  

General
and administrative expenses.  General and administrative expenses were $236,367 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, a 3%
decrease from $244,863 for the same period of fiscal 2016. This was primarily due to a decrease in bank charges, stock option
compensation expense and insurance costs.  

Interest
expense.  Interest expense was $49,573 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, a 14% increase from $43,415 for the same period
of fiscal 2016, due to an increase in interest rate.  

Income
taxes.  There was no income tax for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $361,384
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 0% compared
to (32%) for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the
tax benefit at expected rates being fully offset by a change in our valuation allowance.  

Results
of Operations   Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended September 30, 2015.  For the six months
ended September 30, 2016, there was a net loss of $531,358 compared to a net loss of $1,100,673 for the six months ended September
30, 2015. This was a result of a decrease in operating revenues partially offset by a decrease in total operating expenses. As
apposed to the prior year, there was no impairment during the six months ended September 30, 2016.  

Oil
and gas sales.  Revenue from oil and gas sales was $1,082,567 for the six months ended September 30, 2016, a 23% decrease from
$1,413,456 for the same period of fiscal 2016. This resulted from a decrease in oil and gas prices and oil and gas production.  

Other
operating revenue.  Other operating revenue was $168,458 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $17,982 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the settlement of a lawsuit for underpayment of royalties from Chesapeake
Energy Corporation and Total E P USA in the amount of $148,614.  

Production
and exploration.  Production costs were $487,492 for the six months ended September 30, 2016, a 16% decrease from $582,573
for the six months ended September 30, 2015. This was primarily the result of a decrease in lease operating expenses as a result
of lowering service costs and a decrease in production taxes due to a decrease in oil and gas prices and revenue.  

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $605,752 for the six months ended September
30, 2016, a 30% decrease from $868,630 for the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease to the full cost pool amortization
base and a decrease in oil and gas production partially offset by an increase in oil reserves.  

General
and administrative expenses.  General and administrative expenses were $580,613 for the six months ended September 30, 2016,
a 12% decrease from $658,609 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. This was primarily due to a decrease in engineering
and consulting services, stock option compensation, and insurance expenses.  

Interest
expense.  Interest expense was $91,007 for the six months ended September 30, 2016, an 8% increase from $84,280 for the same
period fiscal 2016 due to an increase in interest rate partially offset by a decrease in borrowings.  

Income
taxes.  There was no income tax for the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $513,331 for
the six months ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was 0% compared to
(32%) for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to the tax
benefit at expected rates being fully offset by a change in our valuation allowance.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

The
primary sources of market risk for us include fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates. All of our financial instruments
are for purposes other than trading.  

Interest
Rate Risk.  At September 30, 2016, we had an outstanding loan balance of $5,520,000 under our revolving credit agreement, which
bears interest at an annual rate equal to the BBA LIBOR daily floating rate, plus 3.0 percentage points. If the interest rate
on our bank debt increases or decreases by one percentage point our annual pretax income would change by $55,200 based on the
outstanding balance at September 30, 2016.  

Credit
Risk.  Credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of nonperformance by other parties of their contractual obligations. Our
primary credit risk is related to oil and gas production sold to various purchasers and the receivables are generally not collateralized.
At September 30, 2016, our largest credit risk associated with any single purchaser was $60,694 or 16% of our total oil and gas
receivables. We are also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance from any of our working interest partners. At September
30, 2016, our largest credit risk associated with any working interest co-owner was $4,905 or 39% of our total trade receivable.
We have not experienced any significant credit losses.  

Energy
Price Risk . Our most significant market risk is the pricing for natural gas and crude oil. Our financial condition, results
of operations, and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil and natural
gas. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. We cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices with any certainty.
Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.  

Factors
that can cause price fluctuations include the level of global demand for petroleum products, foreign supply of oil and gas, the
establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil-exporting countries, weather conditions, the price and availability
of alternative fuels and overall political and economic conditions in oil producing countries.  

Declines
in oil and natural gas prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing
and operating results. Changes in oil and gas prices impact both estimated future net revenue and the estimated quantity of proved
reserves. Any reduction in reserves, including reductions due to price fluctuations, can reduce the borrowing base under our revolving
credit facility and adversely affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to obtain additional
capital for our acquisition, exploration and development activities. In addition, a noncash write-down of our oil and gas properties
could be required under full cost accounting rules if prices declined significantly, even if it is only for a short period of
time. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that can be produced economically. Thus, we may experience
material increases or decreases in reserve quantities solely as a result of price changes and not as a result of drilling or well
performance.  

Similarly,
any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition, results of operations and capital
resources. Oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. Our financial results
are more sensitive to movements in natural gas prices than oil prices because most of our production is natural gas. If the average
oil price had increased or decreased by ten dollars per barrel for the first six months of fiscal 2017, our pretax loss would
have changed by $179,320. If the average gas price had increased or decreased by one dollar per mcf for the first six months of
fiscal 2017, our pretax loss would have changed by $179,094.
