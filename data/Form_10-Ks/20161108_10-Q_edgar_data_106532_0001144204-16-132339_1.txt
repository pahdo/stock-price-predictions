the results for the full year. 

2.    Earnings Per Share  

The following table sets forth the
computation of earnings per share and diluted earnings per share: 

Diluted weighted average shares
outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2016, exclude anti-dilutive stock options totaling 1,232,000 shares of common
stock at a weighted average price of $26.14. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the nine months ended September 30,

as held-to-maturity securities and reported at amortized cost pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 320,  Investments
  Debt and Equity Securities  as the Company has the intent and ability to hold all bond investments to maturity. 

Below is a summary of the amortized
cost and estimated market values of the Company s investment securities as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015. 

The unrealized gains and losses
on investment securities at September 30, 2016, and at December 31, 2015, were as follows:

5.    Segment Information  

The Company has two reportable segments:
North American wholesale operations ( wholesale ) and North American retail operations ( retail ). The
chief operating decision maker, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company s segments
based on earnings from operations. Therefore, interest income or expense, other income or expense, and income taxes are not allocated
to the segments. The  other  category in the tables below includes the Company s wholesale and retail operations
in Australia, South Africa, Asia Pacific and Europe, which do not meet the criteria for separate reportable segment classification.
Summarized segment data for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was as follows: 

6.    Employee Retirement Plans  

The components of the Company s
net pension expense were as follows: 

On September 15, 2016, the Weyco
Group, Inc. Pension Plan was amended to offer an immediate pension payout either as a one-time lump sum or annuity payment to certain
former employees who have not yet commenced benefits under the plan. Benefits would be calculated as of December 1, 2016, with
lump sum payments being paid in December 2016 and annuity payments beginning January 1, 2017. This amendment will not have a material
impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

7.    Stock-Based Compensation Plans  

During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized approximately $393,000 and $1,121,000 respectively, of compensation expense associated
with stock option and restricted stock awards granted in years 2012 through 2016. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, the Company recognized approximately $391,000 and $1,112,000, respectively, of compensation expense associated with stock
option and restricted stock awards granted in years 2011 through 2015. 

The following table summarizes the
Company s stock option activity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016: 

* The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding and exercisable
stock options is defined as the difference between the closing price of the Company's stock on September 30, 2016, the last trading
day of the quarter, of $26.87 and the exercise price multiplied by the number of in-the-money outstanding and exercisable stock
options. 

The following table summarizes the
Company s stock option exercise activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The following table summarizes the
Company s restricted stock award activity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016: 

* The aggregate intrinsic value of non-vested restricted
stock was calculated using the closing price of the Company's stock on September 30, 2016, the last trading day of the quarter,
of $26.87 multiplied by the number of non-vested restricted shares outstanding. 

8.    Short-Term Borrowings  

At September 30, 2016, the Company
had a $60 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank expiring November 4, 2016. The line of credit bears interest at
LIBOR plus 0.75%. At September 30, 2016, outstanding borrowings were approximately $22.8 million at an interest rate of 1.3%. The
highest balance on the line of credit during the quarter was approximately $23.5 million. The line of credit agreement was set
to expire on November 4, 2016, but was renewed on the same terms for another one-year period, expiring November 3, 2017. 

9.    Contingent Consideration  

Contingent consideration was comprised
of two contingent payments that the Company was obligated to pay the former shareholders of The Combs Company ( Bogs )
related to the Company s acquisition of Bogs in 2011. The estimate of contingent consideration was formula-driven and was
based on Bogs achieving certain levels of gross margin dollars between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2015. The first earn-out
payment was due in 2013 and was paid on March 28, 2013, in the amount of $1,270,000. The second earn-out payment was due in the
first quarter of 2016 and was paid on March 23, 2016, in the amount of $5,217,000. 

10.    Financial Instruments  

At September 30, 2016, the Company
had foreign exchange contracts outstanding to sell $1.5 million Canadian dollars at a price of approximately $1.2 million U.S.
dollars. Additionally, the Company s majority-owned subsidiary, Florsheim Australia, had foreign exchange contracts outstanding
to buy $5.2 million U.S. dollars at a price of approximately $6.8 million Australian dollars. Based on quarter-end exchange rates,
there were no significant unrealized gains or losses on the outstanding contracts. 

The Company determines the fair
value of foreign exchange contracts based on the difference between the foreign currency contract rates and the widely available
foreign currency rates as of the measurement date. The fair value measurements are based on observable market transactions, and
thus represent a level 2 valuation as defined by ASC 820. 

11.    Comprehensive Income  

Comprehensive income for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was as follows: 

The components of accumulated other
comprehensive loss as recorded in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets (Unaudited) were as follows:

A reconciliation of the Company s
equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is as follows: 

On November 7, 2016, the Board of
Directors of the Company authorized the freezing of the Weyco Group, Inc. Pension Plan, whereby all benefit accruals, for all employees,
would be frozen effective December 31, 2016. Management of the Company has not yet determined the impact of this freeze on the
consolidated financial statements, although it is not expected to have a material adverse impact.

GENERAL  

The Company designs and markets quality and
innovative footwear for men, women and children under a portfolio of well-recognized brand names including:  Florsheim, 
 Nunn Bush,   Stacy Adams,   BOGS,   Rafters,  and  Umi.  Inventory
is purchased from third-party overseas manufacturers. The majority of foreign-sourced purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. 

The Company has two reportable segments, North
American wholesale operations ( wholesale ) and North American retail operations ( retail ). In the wholesale
segment, the Company s products are sold to leading footwear, department, and specialty stores, primarily in the United States
and Canada. The Company also has licensing agreements with third parties who sell its branded apparel, accessories and specialty
footwear in the United States, as well as its footwear in Mexico and certain markets overseas. Licensing revenues are included
in the Company s wholesale segment. The Company s retail segment consisted of 13 Company-owned retail stores and an
internet business in the United States as of September 30, 2016. Sales in retail outlets are made directly to consumers by Company
employees. 

The Company s  other  operations
include the Company s wholesale and retail businesses in Australia, South Africa, Asia Pacific (collectively,  Florsheim
Australia ) and Europe ( Florsheim Europe ). The majority of the Company s operations are in the United
States, and its results are primarily affected by the economic conditions and the retail environment in the United States. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  

Third Quarter Highlights  

Consolidated net sales for the third quarter
of 2016 were $79.1 million, down 13% as compared to last year s third quarter net sales of $91.2 million. Earnings from operations
were $7.3 million this quarter, a decrease of 20% as compared to $9.1 million in the third quarter of 2015. Consolidated net earnings
attributable to Weyco Group, Inc. were $4.6 million in the third quarter of 2016, down 17% as compared to $5.5 million in the same
period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.44 in the third quarter of 2016 and $0.51 per share in the third quarter of
2015. 

The majority of the decrease in consolidated
net sales came from the Company s wholesale segment. Wholesale net sales declined $12.4 million this quarter, compared to
the same period one year ago. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales of the BOGS, Nunn Bush and Stacy Adams brands. Sales
of the BOGS brand were down following last year s mild winter in North America, while sales of the Nunn Bush and Stacy Adams
brands were down due to a slowdown in consumer spending in the footwear and apparel segments this quarter. Sales in the Company s
retail segment were also down for the quarter, while sales in the Company s other businesses improved due to higher sales
at Florsheim Europe. 

Consolidated earnings from operations decreased
$1.8 million for the quarter, compared to the same period last year, mainly due to lower sales volumes in the Company s North
American wholesale segment. 

Year-to-Date Highlights  

Consolidated net sales for the first nine months
of 2016 were $214.8 million, down 8% from last year s year-to-date net sales of $233.2 million. Earnings from operations
were $12.7 million in the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of 30% as compared to $18.3 million in the first nine months of
2015. Consolidated net earnings attributable to Weyco Group, Inc. were $8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
down 26% as compared to $11.2 million in the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share to date in 2016 were $0.78, versus
$1.03 per share in the same period of 2015. 

The majority of the decrease in consolidated
net sales came from the Company s wholesale segment. Wholesale net sales decreased $18.0 million in the first nine months
of 2016, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower sales of the BOGS and Nunn Bush brands. Sales in the Company s
retail segment and other operations were also down for the year-to-date period, compared to the same period of 2015. 

Consolidated earnings from operations decreased
$5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period one year ago. The majority of the decrease
came from the Company s wholesale segment, due to lower sales volumes. Earnings from operations for the year-to-date period
were also down in the Company s retail segment and in its other businesses. 

Financial Position Highlights  

At September 30, 2016, cash and marketable
securities totaled $39.4 million and outstanding debt totaled $22.8 million. At December 31, 2015, cash and marketable securities
totaled $43.1 million and outstanding debt totaled $26.6 million. During the first nine months of 2016, the Company generated $27.8
million of cash from operations, mainly by reducing its inventory levels this year. The Company used funds to repurchase $9.4 million
of Company stock, to pay $8.8 million in dividends, and to pay down $3.8 million on its revolving line of credit. In addition,
the Company paid $5.2 million for the final earn-out payment related to the 2011 acquisition of Bogs and spent $4.9 million on
capital expenditures. 

SEGMENT ANALYSIS  

Net sales and earnings from operations for
the Company s segments in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were as follows: 

North American Wholesale Segment  

Net Sales  

Net sales in the Company s North American
wholesale segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were as follows: 

North American Wholesale Segment Net Sales  

Stacy Adams and Nunn Bush were both impacted
by a slowdown in consumer spending in the footwear and apparel segments this quarter. Stacy Adams sales were down mainly with off-price
retailers. For the quarter and year-to-date periods, Nunn Bush sales were down across a number of distribution categories, but
most significantly, with mid-tier department stores. Mid-tier department stores are facing a challenging environment as consumer
buying shifts to the internet. Net sales of the Florsheim brand were up for the quarter, mainly due to higher sales to national
shoe chains. To date in 2016, Florsheim s net sales were up due to higher sales to national shoe chains and department stores,
partially offset by lower sales to international retailers. BOGS net sales were down for the quarter and first nine months of 2016,
compared to the same periods last year. These decreases can largely be attributed to last year s mild winter in North America,
which caused many retailers to carry over unsold BOGS inventory into the current year; this not only impacted shipments this year,
but it also caused retailers to be conservative with their orders for Fall of 2016. 

Licensing revenues consist of royalties earned
on the sales of branded apparel, accessories and specialty footwear in the United States and on branded footwear in Mexico and
certain overseas markets. The decrease in licensing revenues for the third quarter and to date through September 30 th 
resulted mainly from licensee transitions that occurred during 2016. 

Earnings from Operations  

Earnings from operations in the North American
wholesale segment were $6.3 million in the third quarter of 2016, down 23% as compared to $8.2 million in the third quarter of
2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, earnings from operations for the wholesale segment were $10.6 million, down
30% as compared to $15.2 million in the same period last year. The decreases for the quarter and year-to-date periods were the
result of lower sales volumes. 

Wholesale gross earnings were 32.2% of net
sales in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 31.4% of net sales in last year s third quarter. The increase this quarter
mainly resulted from the Company s ongoing effort to increase selling prices on select products. For the year-to-date period,
wholesale gross earnings were flat at 31.2% of net sales in both 2016 and 2015. Gross margins in the U.S. were up slightly due
to increased selling prices on select products, as described above. This increase was partially offset by lower gross margins in
Canada. Gross margins in Canada continue to be affected by the weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, as inventory
is purchased in U.S. dollars. In 2015, gains recorded on favorable foreign exchange contacts partially offset the impact of the
weakening Canadian dollar. In 2016, however, no significant gains were recorded on such contracts. 

The Company s cost of sales does not
include distribution costs (e.g., receiving, inspection or warehousing costs). Distribution costs were $2.8 million for the third
quarter of 2016 versus $2.9 million for the same period of 2015. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
distribution costs were $8.8 million and $8.3 million, respectively. The increase for the year-to-date period was primarily due
to additional storage costs incurred in the first half of 2016. Distribution costs were included in selling and administrative
expenses. The Company s gross earnings may not be comparable to other companies, as some companies may include distribution
costs in cost of sales. 

North American wholesale segment selling and
administrative expenses include, and are primarily related to, distribution costs, salaries and commissions, advertising costs,
employee benefit costs and depreciation. As a percent of net sales, wholesale selling and administrative expenses were 22% and
21% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, wholesale selling
and administrative expenses were 25% of net sales in 2016 and 23% of net sales in 2015. The increases in selling and administrative
expenses as a percent of sales for the quarter and year-to-date periods was primarily due to lower sales volumes in 2016, as many
of the Company s selling and administrative costs are fixed in nature and do not correlate with changes in sales volume. 

North American Retail Segment  

Net
Sales   

Net sales in the Company s North American
retail segment declined $65,000 and $199,000, in the third quarter and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.
Same store sales, which include sales of both the U.S. internet business and brick and mortar stores, increased 2% for the quarter
and increased 3% for the year-to-date period, as compared to the same periods in 2015. The increases in same store sales for both
periods were due to higher sales in the Company s internet business. 

Earnings from Operations  

Retail earnings from operations decreased
$89,000 and $376,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in
2015. For the quarter, the decrease in earnings from operations was mainly due to lower operating earnings in the
Company s U.S. internet business resulting from higher marketing  costs. For the year-to-date period, the
decrease in earnings from operations was due to lower net sales at the Company s brick and mortar stores and higher
operating costs in the internet business. Gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 65.5% in the third quarter of 2016
compared to 66.0% in the third quarter of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, retail gross earnings as a percent of
net sales were 65.1% in 2016 and 66.0% in 2015. 

Selling and administrative expenses for the
retail segment include, and are primarily related to, rent and occupancy costs, employee costs, advertising expense and freight.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were 59% and 58% for the three-month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales
were 60% in 2016 and 58% in 2015. 

Other  

The Company s other net sales were $12.2
million in the third quarter of 2016, up 3% as compared to $11.9 million in 2015. This increase was due to higher net sales at
Florsheim Europe. Florsheim Australia s net sales were flat for the quarter. In local currency, Florsheim Australia s
net sales were down 4% for the quarter. Earnings from operations of Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe were $731,000 in the
third quarter of 2016, up 26% as compared to $578,000 in the same period last year. The increase between years was driven by higher
sales volumes and operating earnings at Florsheim Europe. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
other net sales were $34.5 million, down 1% from $34.7 million in the same period last year. This decrease was due to lower net
sales at Florsheim Australia, largely offset by increased sales at Florsheim Europe. Florsheim Australia s sales through
September 30th were down 4% in 2016, compared to the same period last year. In local currency, Florsheim Australia s net
sales were down 1% for the year-to-date period. Earnings from operations of Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe were $1.3
million in the first nine months of 2016, down 33% as compared to $1.9 million in the same period last year. This decrease was
largely due to lower sales and gross margins at Florsheim Australia. Florsheim Australia purchases its inventory in U.S. dollars,
and its gross margins have been negatively impacted by the weakness of its local currency compared to the U.S. dollar. In 2015,
gains recorded on favorable foreign exchange contacts partially offset the impact of the weakening Australian dollar. In 2016,
however, no significant gains were recorded on such contracts. 

Other income and expense  

Interest income for the quarter and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, was down $31,000 and $133,000, respectively, compared to the same periods last year, due to lower average
investment balances this year compared to last year. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense decreased
$6,000, compared to the same period last year, due to a lower average debt balance this quarter. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, interest expense increased $131,000, compared to the same period in 2015, mainly due to a higher average debt balance
throughout 2016, as compared to last year. 

Other income (expense) for the quarter and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, improved by $637,000 and $1,572,000, respectively, compared to the same periods last year.
This quarter s other income included foreign currency transaction gains of $102,000 compared to $340,000 of losses in the
same period of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other income included foreign exchange transaction gains of
$389,000 compared to $783,000 of losses in the same period of 2015. These gains and losses mainly resulted from the revaluation
of an intercompany loan between the Company s wholesale segment and Florsheim Australia. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

The Company s primary sources of liquidity
are its cash, short-term marketable securities and its revolving line of credit. During the first nine months of 2016, the Company
generated $27.8 million of cash from operating activities compared with a use of $27.2 million of cash in the same period of 2015.
The change between years was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally inventory. The decrease
in inventory at September 30, 2016 was the result of the Company reducing its inventories to coincide with lower backlogs, mainly
for the BOGS brand. 

The Company paid cash dividends of $8.8 million
and $8.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The Company continues to repurchase its common
stock under its share repurchase program when the Company believes market conditions are favorable. During the first nine months
of 2016, the Company repurchased 352,175 shares at a total cost of $9.4 million. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately
624,000 shares available under its previously announced stock repurchase program. 

Capital expenditures totaled $4.9 million in
the first nine months of 2016. The Company completed remodeling projects on two of its domestic retail stores, and also opened
a new outlet store in the third quarter. In addition, the Company completed a construction project to increase the capacity of
its U.S. distribution center. Management estimates that annual capital expenditures for 2016 will be approximately $5.5 million. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had a $60
million unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank expiring November 4, 2016. The line of credit bears interest at LIBOR plus
0.75%. The Company repaid a net of $3.8 million on the line of credit during the first nine months of 2016. At September 30, 2016,
outstanding borrowings were $22.8 million at an interest rate of 1.3%. The highest balance on the line of credit during the quarter
was $23.5 million. The line of credit agreement was set to expire on November 4, 2016, but was renewed on the same terms for another
one-year period, expiring November 3, 2017. 

A contingent consideration payment was made
in March 2016 in the amount of $5,217,000. See Note 9 of the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements. 

At September 30, 2016, approximately $1.8 million
of cash and cash equivalents was held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries. 

The Company will continue to evaluate the best
uses for its available liquidity, including, among other uses, capital expenditures, continued stock repurchases and additional
acquisitions. 

The Company believes that available cash and
marketable securities, cash provided by operations, and available borrowing facilities will provide adequate support for the cash
needs of the business for at least one year, although there can be no assurances.

Exhibit 10.1  

Amendment      

THIS
AMENDMENT  (this   Amendment  ) is made as of November 4, 2016, by and between  WEYCO GROUP, INC. 
(the   Borrower  ), and  PNC BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION,  (the   Bank   or   Lender  ). 

BACKGROUND  

A.        The
Borrower has executed and delivered to the Bank (or a predecessor which is now known by the Bank s name as set forth
above), a certain $60,000,000.00 Committed Line of Credit Note dated November 5, 2013 (as extended, amended or otherwise
modified to date, the   Note  ) made pursuant to a certain   Loan   Agreement between the Borrower
and the Bank dated as of November 5, 2013 (as extended, amended or otherwise modified to date, the   Loan Agreement  ),
and a Working Cash , Line of Credit, Investment Sweep Rider dated November 5, 2013 (as extended, amended or otherwise
modified to date, the   Sweep Rider  ) (the Note, the Loan Agreement, the Sweep Rider and any other
instrument or document given in connection with or to secure the Note being collectively referred to as the   Loan
Documents  ). 

B.        The
Note and other Loan Documents evidence or secure some or all of the Borrower s obligations to the Bank for one or more loans
or other extensions of credit (the   Obligations  ). 

C.        The
Borrower and the Bank desire to amend the Loan Documents as provided for in this Amendment. 

NOW, THEREFORE, 
in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows: 

1.  The Loan Documents are amended as follows:   

(b)  The definition of  Daily LIBOR Rate  set forth
in Section 2 of the Note and the Sweep Rider is hereby amended and restated to read in its entirety as follows: 

Daily LIBOR Rate  
shall mean, for any day, the rate per annum determined by the Bank by dividing (A) the Published Rate by (B) a number equal to
1.00 minus the percentage prescribed by the Federal Reserve for determining the maximum reserve requirements with respect to any
eurocurrency fundings by banks on such day; provided, however, if the Daily LIBOR Rate determined as provided above would be less
than zero, then such rate shall be deemed to be zero. The rate of interest will be adjusted automatically as of each Business Day
based on changes in the Daily LIBOR Rate without notice to the Borrower.  

2.        Conditions
to Effectiveness of Amendment: The Bank s willingness to agree to the amendments set forth in this Amendment is subject to
the satisfaction of the following conditions on or before November 4, 2016:

as amended hereby, the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents remain unchanged, are and shall remain in full force and
effect unless and until modified or amended in writing in accordance with their terms, and are hereby ratified and confirmed.
Except as expressly provided herein, this Amendment shall not constitute an amendment, waiver, consent or release with
respect to any provision of any Loan Document, a waiver of any default or Event of Default under any Loan Document, or a
waiver or release of any of the Bank s rights and remedies (all of which are hereby reserved). The Bank may modify this
Amendment for the purposes of completing missing content or correcting erroneous content, without the need for a written
amendment, provided that the Bank shall send a copy of any such modification to the Borrower (which notice may be given by
electronic mail). This Amendment will be interpreted and the rights and liabilities of the parties hereto determined in
accordance with the laws of the State where the Bank s office indicated in the Loan Documents is located, excluding its
conflict of laws rules.  The Borrower expressly ratifies and confirms the confession of judgment (if applicable) and waiver
of jury trial or arbitration provisions contained in the Loan Documents.

WHEREAS , Weyco Group,
Inc. Corporation (the  Company ) sponsors the Weyco Group, Inc. Pension Plan (the  Pension Plan  and 

WHEREAS , the Company
desires that the Plan be frozen effective as of December 31, 2016 and that participants accrue no additional benefits under the
Plan after that date; and 

WHEREAS , the Company
desires to eliminate disability retirement benefits under the Plan for any participant whose employment was not terminated due
to disability prior to January 1, 2017. 

WHEREAS , the Board
of Directors of the Company has previously granted the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company the power
to execute any amendments necessary to carry out the above-described change to the Plan. 

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT
AND IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED  that the Weyco Group, Inc. Pension Plan be amended, effective as of December 31, 2016, to read as
follows: 

PART A   

1.  The last paragraph of the Preamble is restated to read: 

This Part A was restated effective
as of January 1, 2016 (except to the extent a different effective date for a particular provision is specified) and amended effective
as of December 31, 2016 to freeze all benefits under the Plan as of such date. 

2.  New Article XIII is added to read:   

Article XIII 

 ACRUALS FROZEN 

Notwithstanding any provision of this
Plan to the contrary, all benefits hereunder are frozen effective as of December 31, 2016 and no Participant shall accrue any benefits
hereunder after such date. 

PART B   

3.  New subsection (d) is added to Section 1.01,  Accrued Pension , to read:   

(d)        Notwithstanding
any provision herein to the contrary, a Participant's Accrued Pension shall be frozen as of December 31, 2016 and shall not increase
after that date. 

4.  Section 1.06,  Average Annual Compensation , is amended
and restated to read: 

Average Annual Compensation  
means the amount obtained by dividing by 5 the total Compensation of an Employee during the five consecutive Plan Years in the
10 Plan Year period ending with the 2016 Plan Year in which his Compensation was highest. If an Employee s entire period
of service with the Company is less than five Plan Years, the Employee s Average Annual Compensation shall be determined
by averaging (on an annual basis) the Compensation received by the Employee from the Company during the Employee s entire
period of service prior to January 1, 2017 with the Company. 

5.  Section 1.13,  Covered Compensation , is amended to add the following new final sentence thereto:

for an Employee means the average of the Employee s Compensation for the 3-consecutive-year period ending with the Plan Year,
and for Plan Years commencing on or after January 1, 2017, ending with the 2016 Plan Year. If, as of a Plan Year, an Employee s
entire period of employment with the Employer is less than 3 consecutive years, the Employee s Final Average Compensation
must be determined by averaging the Compensation received by the Employee from the Company during the Employee s entire period
of employment with the Company prior to January 1, 2017. The definition of Final Average Compensation used in the Plan shall be
applied consistently with respect to all Employees. In determining an Employee s Final Average Compensation, Compensation
for any Plan Year in excess of the taxable wage base under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act in effect at the beginning of
that Plan Year shall not be taken into account. 

8.  Sections 1.27(b),  Disability Retirement Date , and (c),  Early Retirement Date , are restated to read:   

(b)          Disability
Retirement Date   means the first day of a month following the month in which the Social Security Administration issues
its determination that the Employee has incurred a Disability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, only a Participant whose employment
terminated due to Disability prior to January 1, 2017 shall have a Disability Retirement Date. 

(c)          Early

age 55 and completed 15 years of Vesting Service. 

9.  Section 1.31,  Vesting Service , is amended to add the following new final sentence thereto:   

An Employee's Vesting Service shall include service after
December 31, 2016, the date on which benefits under the Plan were frozen. 

10.  The first sentence of Section 3.03,  Disability Pension , is amended to read:

Service terminated employment prior to January 1, 2017 as a result of Disability and before reaching his Normal Retirement Date,
he shall be entitled to a Pension in the amount of his Accrued Pension at his Disability Retirement Date. 

PART C   

11.  A new final sentence is added to Section 1.01,  Accrued Pension , to read:   

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,
a Participant's Accrued Pension shall be frozen as of December 31, 2016 and shall not increase after that date. 

12.  A new final sentence is added to Section 1.09,  Credited Service , to read:   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant's Credited
Service (but not Vesting Service) shall be frozen as of December 31, 2016 and shall not be increased for Plan Years beginning on
and after January 1, 2017 except that service after December 31, 2016 shall be counted as Credited Service solely for determining
a Participant's eligibility for Early Retirement under Section 2.02. 

13.  A new final sentence is added to Section 1.23(c),  Disability Retirement Date , to read:   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, only a Participant whose
employment terminated due to Disability prior to January 1, 2017 shall have a Disability Retirement Date.  

14.  Section 1.25,  Vesting Service , is amended to add a new paragraph (d) to read:   

An Employee's Vesting Service shall include service after
December 31, 2016 Plan, the date on which benefits under the Plan were frozen. 

15.  The first sentence of Section 3.01,  Eligibility and Payment  ( Disability Pension) , is amended to read:   

Any Employee whose employment ends due to Disability prior
to January 1, 2017 and after attaining age 50 and who has completed at least 15 years of Credited Service, or who at any age has
completed 25 years of Credited Service, if the benefits provided under any accident and health plan maintained by the Company have
ended, shall be entitled to receive a Basic Pension which shall be equal to his Accrued Pension on his Disability Retirement Date. 

Dated this 7th day of November, 2016.
