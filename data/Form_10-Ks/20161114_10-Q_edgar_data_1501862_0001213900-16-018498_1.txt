NOTE
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION, ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation and Organization   

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America for interim financial information and with Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals considered
necessary for a fair presentation, have been included, Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or any other period.
For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto, included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10K for the year ending December 31, 2015.  

As
used in these Notes to the Financial Statements, the terms the  Company ,  we ,  us ,  our 
and similar terms refer to Empire Global Gaming, Inc.  

Empire
Global Gaming, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 11, 2010 in order to acquire certain
U.S Patent license agreements pertaining to roulette and actively engage in the gaming business worldwide and commenced operations
in June, 2010.  The Company was founded to develop, manufacture and sell Class II   Class III Casino electronic
and table games for the general public and casinos worldwide. The Company owns exclusive rights through license agreements to
four U.S. Patents consisting of 14 roulette games patents. We also sells a complete line of public and casino grade gaming products
for roulette, blackjack, craps, baccarat, mini baccarat, pinwheels, Sic Bo, slot machines, poker tables and bingo games. These
patents are certified by Gaming Laboratories International to minimize any unfairness in the multi-number bets in roulette (American
double 0   European single 0) to both players and casinos. One of the patents controlled by the Company is for a  new
number pattern and board layout  that will insure, the various gaming control boards and commissions in the United States
and eventually worldwide, that the highest standards of security and integrity are met.  

The
Company developed a website ( www.lottopick3.com ) which provides analytical data to consumers on several different lottery
type games. This program is not a gambling/consulting program. It is strictly an analysis program. The website does not offer
any advice one way or the other. It offers an in depth breakdown of all the previous numbers that have been drawn in all states
that have the pick 3 games. The software breaks things down into all the possible categories and shows any types of trends that
may occur.  

Significant
Accounting Policies   

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United
States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.    

4  

NOTE
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION, ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company derives its revenue from sale of gaming products and from fees earned for the use of its online lottery number selecting
application. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales only when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery
has occurred, the sale price is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured and from fees as paid for in an online transaction.  

Recent
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issues by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard bodies that
may have an impact on the Company's accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting pronouncements
and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on its accounting
or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows when implemented.  

NOTE
2.  GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate
continuation of the Company as a going concern.  To date, the Company has generated minimal revenues, has accumulated deficit
of $859,555, experienced recurring net operating losses and had a net loss of $24,324 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
 These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. We will need to raise funds
or implement our business plan to continue operations.  

In
order to continue as a going concern, the Company may need, if revenues do not continue to grow, among other things, additional
capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources, if needed, for the Company by obtaining capital from management
and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However
management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described
in the preceding paragraph. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the
Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
3.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

The
Company had notes payable to stockholders who are our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. The notes bear interest
at 4% per annum and are due on December 31, 2018. The notes payable had unpaid balance of $123,820 as of September 30, 2016 and
$90,620 as of December 31, 2015.  

The
Company borrowed $33,200 and $20,500 from stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The
Company recorded interest expense of $1,204 and $859 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and
$3,342 and $2,287 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively for these notes payable and the balances
of accrued interest were $8,944 and $5,602 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively .   

NOTE
4. INCOME TAX   

The
Company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $860,000 as of September 30, 2016, which expires between 2031 to
2035. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. 
Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies
in making this assessment.  Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against the entire
deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will
not be realized.  

NOTE
5.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

The
Company has evaluated all activity of the Company after September 30, 2016 through the issue date of the financial statement and
determined that there was no subsequent events that would require disclosure in the financial statements.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION   

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto. This discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements based
on assumptions about our future business.   

In
General    

We
presently sell our ancillary gaming products in the United States but contemplate selling and leasing our products worldwide.  

We
are controlled by two individuals (our President and Chief Financial Officer) who devote approximately 25 hours a week each of
their time to the business of the Company.  

Although
the Company has obtained the license for the manufacturing, sale, marketing and licensing of the four roulette patents, and certain
other patents, we have not yet applied to any State Gaming Commission(s) to seek approval to sell any of our products. The Company
has not, as of yet, arranged for any lines of credit, and we have no commitments, written or oral, from officers, directors or
shareholders to provide the Company with advances, loans or other funding for our operations.  

Critical
Accounting Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, based on historical experience, and various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We
believe that the Company currently does not have the necessary working capital to support existing operations through 2016 since
the Company has had minimal revenues and accumulated deficit of $859,555 through September 30, 2016. Our primary capital source
will be loans from stockholders. We are seeking to develop and market the patented technologies, manufacture and sell gaming equipment
that will generate cash from operations.  

For
the remainder of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, we anticipate incurring a loss as a result of continued expenses associated
with compliance with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  

Plan
of Operations   

During
the remainder of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, we plan to continue with efforts to develop and market the patented
technologies,  a pick 3 lotto evaluation and analysis program,  manufacture and sell gaming equipment
that will generate cash from operations. We also plan to file all required periodic reports and to maintain our status as a fully-reporting
company under the Exchange Act.  

Based
upon our current cash reserves, although we feel it will be adequate, we may not have adequate resources to meet our short term
or long-term cash requirements. No specific commitments to provide additional funds have been made by management, the principal
stockholders or other stockholders, and we have no current plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with respect to the
sale or issuance of additional securities. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any additional funds will be available
to us to allow us to cover our expenses.

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The
following table summarizes the results of our operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or (decrease) from the current year s three month
period to the prior year s three month period:  

The
variance between the net loss of $7,524 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the net loss of $7,095 for the
same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease in bank service charges of $127, a decrease in computer and internet
expenses of $450, an increase in credit card fees of $110, an increase in professional fees of $407 and an increase in interest
expense of $344.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The
following table summarizes the results of our operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and provides information regarding the dollar and percentage increase or (decrease) from the current year s nine month period
to the prior year s nine month period:  

The
variance between the net loss of $24,324 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the net loss of $22,878 for
the same period in 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in business licenses and fees of $325, a decrease in computer
and internet expenses of $760, an increase in credit card fees of $187, an increase in professional fees of $755 and an increase
in interest expense of $1,054.  

Commitment
and Contingencies    

None.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

At
September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K that
have had or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial statements.  

7  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were not effective. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the
objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within a company are detected.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
has been no change since December 31, 2015 in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the
evaluation of disclosures controls and procedures discussed above that occurred during the period ended September 30, 2016, or
subsequent to that date, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

CERTIFICATION
PURSUANT TO SECTION 302   

   OF
THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002   

I,
Nicholas Sorge, Sr., certify that:  

1.  
      I
    have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 of Empire Global Gaming, Inc. (the
     registrant );   

2.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
    to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
    to the period covered by this report;   

3.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
    material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
    presented in this report;   

4.  
      The
    registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
    (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
    Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:   

a.  
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
    to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
    us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

b.  
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
    our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

c.  
      Evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
    the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such
    evaluation; and   

d.  
      Disclosed
    in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of annual report) that has materially affected,
    or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and   

5.  
      The
    registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
    reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing
    the equivalent functions):   

a.  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
    and   

b.  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
    internal control over financial reporting.

CERTIFICATION
PURSUANT TO SECTION 302   

   OF
THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002   

I,
Dolores Marsh, certify that:  

1.  
      I
    have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 of Empire Global Gaming, Inc. (the
     registrant );   

2.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
    to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
    to the period covered by this report;   

3.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
    material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
    presented in this report;   

4.  
      The
    registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
    (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
    Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:   

a.  
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
    to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
    us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

b.  
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
    our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

c.  
      Evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
    the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such
    evaluation; and   

d.  
      Disclosed
    in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of annual report) that has materially affected,
    or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and   

5.  
      The
    registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
    reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing
    the equivalent functions):   

a.  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
    and   

b.  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
    internal control over financial reporting.
