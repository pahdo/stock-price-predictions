  1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. ( we,   us,   our  or the  Partnership ) is a Delaware limited partnership formed on March 19, 2014 to own and operate assets, including certain assets received from Shell Pipeline Company LP ( SPLC ). We conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiary, Shell Midstream Operating, LLC ( Operating Company ). Our general partner is Shell Midstream Partners GP LLC ( general partner ). References to  Shell  or  Parent   refer collectively to Royal Dutch Shell plc ( RDS ) and its controlled affiliates, other than us, our subsidiaries and our general partner. 
    
  Description of Business 
    
  We are a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by Shell to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets. Our assets consist of interests in entities that own crude oil and refined products pipelines serving as key infrastructure to transport onshore and offshore crude oil production to Gulf Coast and Midwest refining markets and to deliver refined products from those markets to major demand centers. As of   September 30, 2016  , we own interests in   four   crude oil pipeline systems,   three   refined products systems and a crude storage terminal. The crude oil pipeline systems, which are held by Zydeco Pipeline Company LLC ( Zydeco ), Mars Oil Pipeline Company ( Mars ), Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, LLC ( Poseidon ) and the Auger Pipeline System ( Auger ), are strategically located along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. These systems link major onshore and offshore production areas with key refining markets. The refined products pipeline systems are held by Bengal Pipeline Company LLC ( Bengal ) and Colonial Pipeline Company ( Colonial ), which connect Gulf Coast and southeastern U.S. refineries to major demand centers from Alabama to New York, and Explorer Pipeline Company ( Explorer ), which serves more than   70   major cities in   16   states from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest. The crude storage terminal, called the Lockport Terminal ( Lockport ), is located southwest of Chicago and serves Midwest refineries. Auger and Lockport are owned by our wholly owned subsidiary, Pecten Midstream LLC ( Pecten ). 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we own a   100%   interest in Pecten, a   92.5%   interest in Zydeco, a   28.6%   interest in Mars, a   36.0%   interest in Poseidon, a   50.0%   interest in Bengal, a   6.0%   interest in Colonial and a   2.62%   interest in Explorer. Each of Pecten and Zydeco is consolidated within our condensed consolidated financial statements as a subsidiary. The   7.5%   ownership interest in Zydeco retained by SPLC is reflected as noncontrolling interest in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We account for each of our investments in Mars, Bengal and Poseidon using the equity method of accounting, and we account for each of our investments in Colonial and Explorer using the cost method of accounting. 
    
  We generate the majority of our revenue under long-term agreements by charging fees for the transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products through our pipelines and storage tanks. Our operations consist of   one   reportable segment. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements include all majority owned and non-majority owned subsidiaries required to be consolidated under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ). Our reporting currency is U.S. dollars, and all references to dollars are U.S. dollars. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete annual financial statements. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. During interim periods, we follow the accounting policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (our  2015 Annual Report ), filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   include all adjustments we believe are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed. Operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ended   December 31, 2016  . These unaudited condensed consolidated financial  
  
   7 

statements and other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  The   September 30, 2015   condensed consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted for the acquisition of the Shell Auger and Lockport Operations (the "Shell Auger and Lockport Operations"). These retrospective adjustments include expense allocations for certain functions historically performed by our Parent on behalf of the Shell Auger and Lockport Operations, including allocations of general corporate expenses related to finance, legal, information technology, human resources, communications, ethics and compliance, shared services, employee benefits and incentives, insurance, and share-based compensation. See   Note 2 Acquisitions   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Prior to the contribution of fixed assets and certain agreements on October 1, 2015 related to the Shell Auger and Lockport Operations, the cash generated and used by these operations was deposited to SPLC s centralized account which was comingled with the cash of other pipeline entities controlled by SPLC. SPLC funded these operating and investing activities as needed. Accordingly, we did not record any cash and cash equivalents held by SPLC on behalf of the Shell Auger and Lockport Operations for any period prior to October 1, 2015. We reflected the cash generated by these operations and expenses paid by SPLC on behalf of these operations as Net distributions to Parent within the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
    
  Our asset acquisitions are accounted for prospectively from the effective date of the transaction. The condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 reflect the results of the following assets acquired prospectively from the dates indicated: 
    
     The interest in Explorer acquired August 9, 2016; 
     The additional interests in Zydeco, Bengal and Colonial acquired effective April 1, 2016; 
     The additional interests in Zydeco and Colonial acquired effective April 1, 2015; and 
     The interest in Poseidon acquired effective July 1, 2015. 
    
  See   Note 2 Acquisitions   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  The accounting policies are set forth in   Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   of our 2015 Annual Report. There have been no significant changes to these policies during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  For additional information on accounting pronouncements issued prior to December 2015, refer to   Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   of our 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued accounting standards update (ASU 2016-17) to topic 810, Consolidation, making changes on how a reporting entity should treat indirect interests in an entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. This update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Adoption of this update will not have an impact on our financial statements at this time. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued accounting standards update (ASU 2016-15) to topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, making changes to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in order to reduce diversity in presentation. This update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The update addresses eight specific cash flow issues, of which only one is applicable to our financial statements. The applicable update relates to distributions received from equity method investees and prescribes two options for presenting these cash flows: cumulative earnings approach or nature of the distribution approach. We currently apply cumulative earnings approach, when the distributions received are considered returns on investment and classified as cash inflows from operating activities.  Adoption of this update will not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued accounting standards update (ASU 2016-07) to topic 323, Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures, to eliminate the need for an entity to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting when an investment becomes qualified for the use of the equity method of accounting due to an increase in level of ownership or degree of  
  
   8 

influence. This provision is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the effect of adoption of this guidance on our financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued accounting standards update (ASU 2016-01) to topic 825, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, requiring equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Additionally, the update allows equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values to be re-measured at fair value either upon the occurrence of an observable price change or upon identification of impairment, and requires additional disclosure around those investments. This update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect of this guidance which is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.  

In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2015-02) making targeted changes to the current consolidation guidance. The new standard changes the considerations related to substantive rights, related parties, and decision making fees when applying the variable interest entity consolidation model and eliminates certain guidance for limited partnerships and similar entities under the voting interest consolidation model. The update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

2. Acquisitions 
    
  On August 9, 2016, we acquired a   2.62%   equity interest in Explorer from SPLC (the  August 2016 Acquisition ) for   $26.2 million  . The August 2016 Acquisition was made in connection with SPLC s right, as a current shareholder of Explorer, to acquire a portion of the equity interest being divested by another shareholder of Explorer.  SPLC separately owns a   35.97%   equity interest in Explorer.  The August 2016 Acquisition closed on August 9, 2016 pursuant to a Share Purchase and Sale Agreement among us, the Operating Company and SPLC, and is accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. We funded the August 2016 Acquisition with   $26.3 million   of cash on hand. Total transaction costs of   $0.1 million   were incurred. The terms of the August 2016 Acquisition were approved by the Board of Directors of our general partner (the  Board ). See   Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Common Control Transactions   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   of our 2015 Annual Report for further discussion of how we account for the acquisition of assets and businesses under common control. 
    
  On May 23, 2016, we acquired an additional   30.0%   interest in Zydeco, an additional   1.0%   interest in Bengal and an additional   3.0%   interest in Colonial for   $700.0 million   in consideration (the  May 2016 Acquisition ). The May 2016 Acquisition closed pursuant to a Contribution Agreement (the  May 2016 Contribution Agreement ) dated May 17, 2016 among us, the Operating Company and SPLC and became effective on April 1, 2016, and is accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. We funded the May 2016 Acquisition with   $345.8 million   from the net proceeds of a registered public offering of   10,500,000   common units representing limited partner interests in us (the  May 2016 Offering ),   $50.4 million   of cash on hand and   $296.7 million   in borrowings under the   Five   Year Revolver (as defined in   Note 7 Related Party Debt  ) with Shell Treasury Center (West) Inc. ( STCW ), an affiliate of Shell. The remaining   $7.1 million   in consideration consisted of an issuance of   214,285   general partner units to our general partner in order to maintain its   2.0%   general partner interest in us. Total transaction costs of   $0.4 million   were incurred in association with the May 2016 Acquisition. The terms of the May 2016 Acquisition were approved by the Board and by the conflicts committee of the Board, which consists entirely of independent directors. The conflicts committee engaged an independent financial advisor and legal counsel. In accordance with the May 2016 Contribution Agreement, SPLC has agreed to reimburse us for our proportionate share of certain costs and expenses incurred by Zydeco after April 1, 2016 with respect to a directional drill project to address soil erosion over a two-mile section of our 22-inch diameter pipeline under the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Shaffer in Louisiana. Such reimbursements will be treated as an additional capital contribution from the general partner at the time of payment. The May 2016 Contribution Agreement contained customary representations and warranties and indemnification by SPLC. 
    
  In connection with the May 2016 Acquisition we acquired book value of net assets under common control as follows: 

9 

(1)   
    Book value of   3.0%   additional interest in Colonial contributed by SPLC. 
               (2)   
    Book value of   1.0%   additional interest in Bengal contributed by SPLC. 
               (3)   
    Book value of   30.0%   additional interest in Zydeco from SPLC s noncontrolling interest. 
       
  We recognized   $606.3 million   of consideration in excess of the book value of net assets acquired as a capital distribution to our general partner in accordance with our policy for common control transactions.  This capital distribution is comprised of   $599.2   million in cash and   $7.1 million   in general partner units issued. 

On November 17, 2015, we acquired from SPLC a   100%   interest in Pecten, which holds the Shell Auger and Lockport Operations. The acquisition of Pecten was a transfer of a business between entities under common control, which requires it to be accounted for as if the transfer had occurred at the beginning of the period of transfer, with prior periods retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative financial information. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements and notes for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the business of Auger and Lockport prior to the acquisition's effective date of October 1, 2015. See   Note 3   Acquisitions   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   of our 2015 Annual Report for further discussion of this acquisition. 
    
  The following tables present our condensed consolidated statement of income and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   three and nine   ended   September 30, 2015   giving effect to the acquisition of Pecten. The results of Pecten prior to the effective date of the acquisition are included in  Shell Auger and Lockport Operations  and the consolidated results are included in  Consolidated Results  within the tables below:

On July 1, 2015, Shell Oil Products US ( SOPUS ) conveyed to us its   36.0%   interest in Poseidon (the  July 2015 Acquisition ) for   $350.0   million in cash. The July 2015 Acquisition closed pursuant to a contribution agreement dated July 1, 2015 (the  Poseidon Contribution Agreement ) among the Operating Company, the Partnership and SOPUS and is accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. We have recorded this asset acquisition prospectively from the effective date. Poseidon is a Delaware Limited Liability Company formed in February 1996 to design, construct, own and operate a non-Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) regulated crude oil pipeline system located offshore Louisiana in the central region of the Gulf of Mexico. We account for our interest in Poseidon using the equity method of accounting. 
    
  In connection with the July 2015 Acquisition we acquired book value of net assets under common control of   $30.5   million which is included in Equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheet. We recognized   $319.5   million of consideration in excess of the book value of net assets acquired as a capital distribution to our General Partner in accordance with our policy for common control transactions. 
    
  On May 18, 2015, we acquired an additional   19.5%   interest in Zydeco and an additional   1.388%   interest in Colonial for   $448.0 million   in cash (the  May 2015 Acquisition ). The May 2015 Acquisition closed pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated May 12, 2015 ( Purchase and Sale Agreement ) among us, the Operating Company and SPLC and became effective on April 1, 2015, and was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. We funded the May 2015 Acquisition with   $297.7 million   from the Private Placement (as defined in   Note 8 Equity  ),   $80.0 million   of cash on hand and   $70.8 million   in borrowings under the   Five   Year Revolver with STCW. Total transaction costs of   $0.5 million   were incurred in association with the May 2015 Acquisition. The terms of the May 2015 Acquisition were approved by the Board and by the conflicts committee of the Board, which consists entirely of independent directors. The conflicts committee engaged an independent financial advisor and legal counsel. In accordance with the Purchase and Sale Agreement, SPLC agreed to reimburse us for our proportionate share of certain costs and expenses incurred by Zydeco after April 1, 2015 with respect to a directional drill project to address soil erosion over a two-mile section of our 22-inch diameter pipeline under the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Shaffer in Louisiana. Such reimbursements will be treated as an additional capital contribution from the general partner at the time of payment. 
    
  In connection with the May 2015 Acquisition we acquired book value of net assets under common control as follows: 

(1)    Book value of   1.388%   additional interest in Colonial contributed by SPLC. 
   (2)    Book value of   19.5%   additional interest in Zydeco from SPLC's noncontrolling interest.

See   Note 3 Related Party Transactions   for additional details. 

9. Net Income Per Limited Partner Unit 
    
  Net income per unit applicable to common limited partner units and to subordinated limited partner units is computed by dividing the respective limited partners  interest in net income attributable to the Partnership for the period by the weighted average number of common units and subordinated units, respectively, outstanding for the period. Because we have more than one class of participating securities, we use the two-class method when calculating the net income per unit applicable to limited partners. The classes of participating securities include common units, subordinated units, general partner units and incentive distribution rights. Basic and diluted net income per unit are the same because we do not have any potentially dilutive units outstanding for the period presented.  
    
  Our net income for 2015 includes earnings of our Parent related to acquired businesses for periods prior to their acquisition by us. Under the two class method these earnings must be allocated entirely to our general partner. We have allocated these earnings of our Parent to our general partner.

The following tables show the allocation of net income attributable to the Partnership to arrive at net income per limited partner unit: 

24 

25 

10. Income Taxes 
    
  We are not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes or for the majority of states that impose an income tax.  Taxes on our net income are generally borne by our partners through the allocation of taxable income. Our income tax expense results from partnership activity in the state of Texas, as conducted by Zydeco. Income tax expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was less than   $0.1 million   and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $(0.3) million   and   zero  , respectively. 

11. Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We routinely conduct reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations. These reviews assist us in identifying environmental issues and estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts. In making environmental liability estimations, we consider the material effect of environmental compliance, pending legal actions against us and potential third-party liability claims. Often, as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses, additional information is obtained, requiring revisions to estimated costs. These revisions are reflected in our income in the period in which they are probable and reasonably estimable. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   accruals for environmental clean-up costs. 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  We are named defendants in lawsuits and governmental proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. For each of our outstanding legal matters, we evaluate the merits of the case, our exposure to the matter, possible legal or settlement strategies and the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. While there are still uncertainties related to the ultimate costs we may incur, based upon our evaluation and experience to date, we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results, or cash flows. 
    
  Effective July 31, 2014, a rate case was filed against Zydeco with the FERC.  The rate case was resolved by a settlement approved by FERC which established maximum uncommitted (or non-contract) rates for uncommitted shippers effective December 1, 2015.  The settlement also provided for rate refunds for shippers of the difference between the higher pre-settlement uncommitted (or non-contract) rates and the lower settlement rates for the period from July 31, 2014 to November 30, 2015 (plus interest). We recognized   $2.3 million   of general and administrative expenses in 2015 related to the settlement of this rate case. We were indemnified by SPLC under the Omnibus Agreement for some of the costs incurred. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no outstanding payables or receivables related to this case as all shippers' settlements were paid in January 2016 and all indemnifications from SPLC have been received.  
    
  Minimum Throughput  
    
  On September 1, 2016, the in-service date of the capital lease for the Port Neches storage tanks, a joint tariff agreement with a third party became effective and requires monthly payments of approximately   $0.4 million  . The tariff will be analyzed annually and updated based on the FERC indexing adjustment to rates effective July 1 of each year. The initial term of the agreement is ten years with automatic one year renewal terms with the option to cancel prior to each renewal period.  

12. Subsequent Events 
    
  We have evaluated events that have occurred after   September 30, 2016  , through the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. Any material subsequent events that occurred during this time have been properly recognized or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  
    
  Distribution 
    
  On   October 19, 2016  , the Board declared a cash distribution of   $0.26375   per limited partner unit for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The distribution will be paid on   November 14, 2016   to unitholders of record as of   October 31, 2016  .

October 2016 Acquisition 
    
  On September 27, 2016, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement among SPLC, SOPUS and the Operating Company to acquire a   49.0%   interest in Odyssey and an additional   20.0%   interest in Mars for   $350.0 million   (the  October 2016 Acquisition ). We funded the October 2016 Acquisition with   $50.0 million   of cash on hand and   $300.0 million   in borrowings under the   Five   Year Revolver.  The October 2016 Acquisition closed on October 3, 2016.  
    
  Colonial Incident  
    
  As publicly announced by Colonial on October 31, 2016, a crew working on Colonial s gasoline pipeline ("Line 1") in Alabama experienced an incident when the track hoe it was operating hit the pipeline causing a fire, which was later contained. Line 1 was shut down and remains shut down as of November 3, 2016. We cannot predict how long Line 1 will remain down. We continue to monitor the situation but cannot predict the impact the shutdown of the pipeline will have on our results of operations and cash flow.

You should also read the following discussion and analysis together with the risk factors set forth in our 2015 Annual Report and the  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  in this report. 
    
  Partnership Overview 
    
  We are a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by Shell to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets. Our assets consist of interests in entities that own crude oil and refined products pipelines and terminals serving as key infrastructure to transport onshore and offshore crude oil production to Gulf Coast and Midwest refining markets and to deliver refined products from Gulf Coast markets to major demand centers. We generate the majority of our revenue under long-term agreements by charging fees for the transportation or storage of crude oil and refined products through our pipelines.  
    
  As of September 30, 2016, our assets consist of the following: 

A 92.5% ownership interest in Zydeco Pipeline Company LLC ( Zydeco ), which was wholly owned by SPLC prior to the IPO. Zydeco wholly owns the Houston-to-Houma crude oil pipeline system, or Ho-Ho, which is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Zydeco delivers primarily into the St. James and Clovelly, Louisiana markets. Zydeco is situated within the largest refining market in the United States. 

A 28.6% ownership interest in Mars Oil Pipeline Company ( Mars ). Mars is a major corridor crude oil pipeline in a high-growth area of the offshore Gulf of Mexico, originating offshore in the deepwater Mississippi Canyon and terminating in salt dome caverns in Clovelly, Louisiana. 

A 50.0% ownership interest in Bengal Pipeline Company LLC ( Bengal ). Bengal s refined products pipeline connects four refineries in the St. Charles, Norco, Garyville and Convent areas of Louisiana with refined products storage tankage in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Bengal also connects with the Plantation and Colonial pipelines, providing major market outlets to the East Coast from the Gulf Coast. 

A 36.0% ownership interest in Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, L.L.C. ( Poseidon ), a strategic link for central Gulf of Mexico oil to key markets in Louisiana (the  July 2015 Acquisition ). 
     
   27 

A 6.0% ownership interest in Colonial Pipeline Company ( Colonial ). Colonial is the largest refined products pipeline in the United States, transporting refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel, providing major market outlets to the East Coast from the Gulf Coast. 

A 100% interest in Pecten Midstream LLC ( Pecten ). Pecten comprises a crude oil pipeline system located in the Gulf of Mexico ( Auger ) and a crude oil storage terminal located southwest of Chicago ( Lockport ).  

A 2.62% interest in Explorer Pipeline Company  ( Explorer ).  Explorer transports gasoline, diesel, fuel oil and jet fuel from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest through its 1,830 mile pipeline, serving more than 70 major cities in 16 states (the "August 2016 Acquisition"). 
       
  The ownership interests above include a 19.5% interest in Zydeco and a 1.388% interest in Colonial acquired on May 18, 2015 (the "May 2015 Acquisition"), as well as an additional 30.0% interest in Zydeco, an additional 1.0% interest in Bengal and an additional 3.0% interest in Colonial acquired on May 23, 2016 (the "May 2016 Acquisition").  
    
  On October 3, 2016, we acquired a 49.0% interest in Odyssey Pipeline L.L.C. and an additional 20.0% interest in Mars (the "October 2016 Acquisition").  
    
  How We Generate Revenue 
    
  All but our Lockport assets generate revenue under five types of long-term transportation agreements: transportation services agreements, throughput and deficiency agreements, life-of-lease agreements, life-of-lease agreements with a guaranteed return and buy-sell agreements. Our transportation services agreements and our throughput and deficiency agreements have initial terms ranging from five to fifteen years, and our life-of-lease agreements have a term equal to the life of the applicable mineral lease. We also transport volumes on a spot basis using rates on posted tariffs and rate sheets.  
    
  Many of our transportation agreements include a provision to allow us to adjust the rate annually based on the FERC index, which adjusts on July 1 of each year. There is no requirement to reduce the rate when the FERC index is negative, other than FERC regulated spot rates if our rates were to exceed the adjusted index ceiling. The FERC index effective July 1, 2016 was negative 2.0135%. While a few rates on our assets were reduced to comply with the index, such as the spot rates on Zydeco out of Houma, most rates on our assets were not affected due to the fact that the index did not apply to them or they were already below the index ceiling level. Additionally, our spot rates on Zydeco that were subject to the rate case filed against Zydeco with the FERC are not subject to adjustment until November 2017. 
    
  Zydeco s FERC-approved transportation services agreements entitle the customer to a specified amount of guaranteed capacity on a pipeline. This capacity cannot be pro-rated even if the pipeline is oversubscribed. In exchange, the customer makes a specified monthly payment regardless of the volume transported. If the customer does not ship its full guaranteed volume in a given month, it makes the full monthly cash payment and it may ship the unused volume in a later month for no additional cash payment for up to 12 months, subject to availability on the pipeline. The cash payment received is recognized as deferred revenue, and thereby not included in revenue or net income, until the earlier of the shipment of the unused volumes or the expiration of the 12-month period, as provided for in the applicable contract. If there is insufficient capacity on the pipeline to allow the unused volume to be shipped, the customer forfeits its right to ship such unused volume. We do not refund any cash payments relating to unused volumes.  
    
  Our throughput and deficiency agreements establish a minimum, annual average volume for each year during a fixed period. If the customer falls below the minimum volume in a year, it is required to pay a deficiency payment equal to the difference at the end of the year. Typically, surplus volumes in a year can be reserved for use in subsequent years where there is a deficiency. We refer to our transportation services agreements and our throughput and deficiency agreements as  ship-or-pay  contracts.  
    
  Our life-of-lease agreements, some of which have a guaranteed return for us, require producers to transport all production from the specified fields connected to the pipeline for the life of the lease. This means that the dedicated production cannot be transported by any other means, such as barges or another pipeline. These agreements can also include provisions to guarantee a return to the pipeline to enable the pipeline to recover its investment despite the uncertainty in production volumes by providing for an annual transportation rate adjustment over a fixed period of time to achieve a fixed rate of return. The calculation for the fixed rate of return is based on actual project costs and operating costs. At the end of the fixed period, the rate will be locked in at the last calculated rate and adjusted thereafter based on the FERC index.  

28 

Poseidon transports crude oil using buy-sell agreements where it buys oil at the wellhead and sells it back to the shipper at a pre-determined price marked up for transportation. 
    
  Our long-term transportation agreements and tariffs for crude oil transportation include product loss allowance ( PLA ). PLA is an allowance for volume losses due to measurement difference set forth in crude oil product transportation agreements, including long-term transportation agreements and tariffs for crude oil shipments. PLA is intended to assure proper measurement of the crude oil despite solids, water, evaporation and variable crude types that can cause mismeasurement. The PLA provides additional revenue for us if product losses on our pipelines are within the allowed levels, and we are required to compensate our customers for any product losses that exceed the allowed levels. We take title to any excess loss allowance when product losses are within the allowed levels, and we sell that product several times per year at prevailing market prices.  
    
  All of Lockport s revenue is generated under long-term guaranteed storage tank services and throughput agreements with remaining terms of six months to three years. 
    
  How We Evaluate Our Operations 
    
  Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (i) revenue (including PLA) from contracted capacity and throughput; (ii) operations and maintenance expenses; (iii) Adjusted EBITDA (defined below); and (iv) cash available for distribution. 
    
  Contracted Capacity and Throughput 
    
  The amount of revenue our assets generate primarily depends on our long-term transportation agreements with shippers and the volumes of crude oil and refined products that we handle through our pipelines and storage tanks. If shippers do not meet the minimum contracted volume commitments under our ship-or-pay contracts, we have the right to charge for reserved capacity or for deficiency payments as described in     How We Generate Revenue  .  Our assets also earn revenue by shipping crude oil and refined products on a spot rate basis in accordance with our tariff or posted rate sheets and under buy-sell agreements. 
    
  The commitments under our long-term transportation agreements with shippers and the volumes which we handle in our pipelines and storage tanks are primarily affected by the supply of, and demand for, crude oil and refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. This supply and demand is impacted by the market prices for crude oil and refined products in the markets we serve. Our results of operations will be impacted by our ability to: 

maintain utilization of and rates charged for our pipelines and storage facilities;  

utilize the remaining uncommitted capacity on, or add additional capacity to, our pipeline systems;  

increase throughput volumes on our pipeline systems by making connections to existing or new third party pipelines or other facilities, primarily driven by the anticipated supply of, and demand for, crude oil and refined products; and  

identify and execute organic expansion projects.  
       
  Operations and Maintenance Expenses 
    
  Our management seeks to maximize our profitability by effectively managing operations and maintenance expenses. These expenses are comprised primarily of labor expenses (including contractor services), utility costs (including electricity and fuel) and repairs and maintenance expenses. Utility costs fluctuate based on throughput volumes and the grades of crude oil and types of refined products we handle. Our other operations and maintenance expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput and storage volumes, but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities, particularly maintenance activities, performed during that period.  
    
  Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution 
    
  The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities. Please refer to    Results of Operations -    
  
   29 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures    for the reconciliation of GAAP measures net income and cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP measures Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution.  
    
  We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income taxes, net interest expense, gain or loss from dispositions of fixed assets, allowance oil reduction to net realizable value, and depreciation, amortization and accretion,   plus   cash distributed to us from equity investments for the applicable period,   less   income from equity investments. We define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership as Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests.  
  We define cash available for distribution as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership less maintenance capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership, net interest paid, cash reserves and income taxes paid, plus net adjustments from volume deficiency payments attributable to the Partnership and certain one-time payments received. Cash available for distribution will not reflect changes in working capital balances. 
    
  We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP supplemental financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. We present these financial measures because we believe replacing our proportionate share of our equity investments  net income with the cash received from such equity investments more accurately reflects the cash flow from our business, which is meaningful to our investors. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our condensed consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess: 

our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; 

the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders; 

our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and 

the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. 
       
  Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or cash available for distribution in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.  
    
  Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results 
    
  Our results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   (the  Current Quarter ) and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (the  Current Period ) will not be comparable to our historical results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   (the  Comparable Quarter ) and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   (the "Comparable Period") for the reasons described below: 

Our ownership interest in Poseidon was not included in the results of operations for the first six months of the Comparable Period, as we accounted for this investment prospectively from our acquisition on July 1, 2015. 

For both the Comparable Quarter and the Comparable Period, our ownership interest in Bengal was 49.0%. We acquired an additional 1.0% interest in Bengal effective April 1, 2016, increasing our ownership interest from 49.0% to 50.0%. 

30 

Our ownership interest in Explorer was not included in the results of operations until the Current Quarter, as we accounted for this investment prospectively from our acquisition on August 9, 2016. 
       
  Although we acquired Pecten effective October 1, 2015, the results of operations for the Comparable Period have been retrospectively adjusted to include the results of operations of Auger and Lockport (the  Shell Auger and Lockport Operations ) for the entire period. 
    
  Factors Affecting Our Business and Outlook 
    
  Substantially all of our revenue is derived from long-term transportation and storage service agreements with shippers, including ship-or-pay agreements and life-of-lease agreements, some of which provide a guaranteed return, and long-term storage service agreements with customers ranging from marketers to crude oil producers to refineries. We believe the commercial terms of these long-term transportation and storage service agreements substantially mitigate volatility in our cash flows by limiting our direct exposure to reductions in volumes due to supply or demand variability. Our business can, however, be negatively affected by sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy in general, and is impacted by shifts in supply and demand dynamics, the mix of services requested by the customers of our pipelines, competition and changes in regulatory requirements affecting our operations. 
    
  We believe key factors that impact our business are the supply of, and demand for, crude oil and refined products in the markets in which our business operates. We also believe that our customers  requirements, competition and government regulation of crude oil and refined products pipelines play an important role in how we manage our operations and implement our long-term strategies.  These factors are discussed in more detail below. 
    
  Changes in Crude Oil Sourcing and Refined Product Demand Dynamics 
    
  To effectively manage our business, we monitor our market areas for both short-term and long-term shifts in crude oil and refined products supply and demand. Changes in crude oil supply such as new discoveries of reserves, declining production in older fields and the introduction of new sources of crude oil supply, affect the demand for our services from both producers and consumers. One of the strategic advantages of our crude oil pipeline systems is their ability to transport attractively priced crude oil from multiple supply markets to key refining centers along the Gulf Coast. Our crude oil shippers periodically change the relative mix of crude oil grades delivered to the refineries and markets served by our pipelines. They also occasionally choose to store crude longer term when the forward price is higher than the current price (a  contango market ). While these changes in the sourcing patterns of crude oil transported or stored are reflected in changes in the relative volumes of crude oil by type handled by our pipelines, our total crude oil transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall crude oil supply and demand dynamics. 
    
  Similarly, our refined products pipelines have the ability to serve multiple major demand centers. Our refined products shippers periodically change the relative mix of refined products shipped on our refined products pipelines, as well as the destination points, based on changes in pricing and demand dynamics. While these changes in shipping patterns are reflected in relative types of refined products handled by our various pipelines, our total product transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall refined products supply and demand dynamics. 
    
  As these supply and demand dynamics shift, we anticipate that we will continue to actively pursue projects that link new sources of supply to producers and consumers. Similarly, as demand dynamics change, we anticipate that we will create new services or capacity arrangements that meet customer requirements. 
    
  Changes in Commodity Prices and Customers      Volumes 
    
  Crude oil prices declined substantially during 2015 and have remained low in the first nine months of 2016. The current global geopolitical and economic uncertainty may contribute to continued volatility in financial and commodity markets in the near to medium term. Except for PLA, we do not take ownership of the crude oil or refined products for any other of our pipelines or terminals. As a result, our direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations is limited to the PLA provisions in our tariffs. We have indirect exposure to commodity price fluctuations to the extent such fluctuations affect the shipping patterns of our customers. Our assets benefit from the long-term fee based arrangements, and are strategically positioned to connect crude oil volumes originating from key onshore and offshore production basins to the Texas and Louisiana refining markets, where demand for throughput has remained strong even in the current crude oil price environment. We have not experienced a material decline in throughput volumes on Zydeco, Mars, Poseidon and Auger, our crude oil pipeline systems, as a result of lower crude oil prices. However, if crude oil prices remain at low levels for a sustained period, we could see a reduction in our transportation volumes if production coming into our systems is deferred and our associated allowance oil sales decrease. Our  
  
   31 

customers may also experience liquidity and credit problems, which could cause them to defer development or repair projects, avoid our contracts in bankruptcy, or renegotiate our contracts on terms that are less attractive to us or impair their ability to perform under our contracts.  
    
  Our throughput volumes on our refined products pipeline systems depend primarily on the volume of refined products produced at connected refineries and the desirability of our end markets. These factors in turn are driven by refining margins, maintenance schedules and market differentials. Refining margins depend on the cost of crude oil or other feedstocks and the price of refined products. These margins are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including the domestic and global supply of and demand for crude oil and refined products. We are currently experiencing relatively high demand for our pipeline systems serving refineries.  
    
  Changes in Customers      Volumes Unrelated to Commodity Prices 
    
  Transportation volumes on Auger were lower in the Current Quarter than the Comparable Quarter due to rework of certain wells and declining production volumes.  Revenue on Auger also declined as the surcharge to recover costs for enhancements on the system expired. In addition, certain connected producers directed flow to other markets in response to local market pricing changes which drove more barrels to Poseidon. Volumes on Poseidon were higher in the Current Quarter than the Comparable Quarter as the platform work for future well connection and planned maintenance on Poseidon was completed. Poseidon transportation volumes have also experienced an increase in the near term as significant deepwater production areas ramp up production and a strong market for the Poseidon barrel. Transportation volumes on Lockport were lower in the Current Quarter compared to the Comparable Quarter due to increased storage in the contango market and a competitor pipeline that connects to Patoka. However, Lockport continues to benefit from a throughput and deficiency agreement and long-term storage service agreements. Volumes on Zydeco were slightly lower in the Current Quarter than the Comparable Quarter between Nederland and Lake Charles due to the opening of an alternate route, as well as lower spot market demand out of Houston.  Zydeco's volumes have benefited from connections with multiple pipelines out of the Houston and Nederland/Port Neches areas of Texas seeking access to the Louisiana refining market. Completion of the Port Neches connection to the Sunoco Nederland terminal and a debottlenecking project out of Houma is expected to enhance volumes able to access the important Clovelly and St. James, Louisiana markets.  Although Mars experienced higher demand for storage as shippers took advantage of the contango market in the first half of 2016, shippers have recently moved volume out of storage thereby increasing transportation volumes.  
    
  In September 2016, approximately 25% of nominated capacity between Houma and St. James went unused due to shippers not meeting their nominated volumes. This resulted in Zydeco having unused capacity and lower revenues. Effective for December 2016 nominations, all shippers on Zydeco must agree to submit a binding nomination within two days of allocation notice and will be charged the tariff rate for 95% of binding nomination whether or not the reserved capacity is utilized.  This nonperformance penalty applies to any Zydeco movement that is allocated, resulting in shippers being held responsible for 95% of their binding nominations. 
    
  Colonial Incident  
    
  As publicly announced by Colonial on October 31, 2016, a crew working on Colonial s gasoline pipeline ("Line 1") in Alabama experienced an incident when the track hoe it was operating hit the pipeline causing a fire, which was later contained. Line 1 was shut down and remains shut down as of November 3, 2016. We cannot predict how long Line 1 will remain down. We continue to monitor the situation but cannot predict the impact the shutdown of the pipeline will have on our cash available for distribution.  
    
  Major Maintenance Projects 
    
  We currently have three major maintenance projects in 2016.  
    
  On the Zydeco pipeline system, we are in the permitting stage of a directional drill project to address soil erosion over a two-mile section of our 22-inch diameter pipeline under the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Shaffer in Louisiana.  Due to delays in permitting, the project has been postponed to the first half of 2017 to allow performance of the work during optimal weather and water conditions. Zydeco expects to incur approximately   $24.0 million   in maintenance capital expenditures for the total project, of which approximately   $22.2 million   would be attributable to our ownership share. During late 2015, and through   September 30, 2016  , Zydeco incurred   $2.3 million   of capitalized costs related to this project and expects to spend approximately   $2.8 million   in the fourth quarter of 2016.  In connection with the acquisition of additional interests in Zydeco in May 2015 and May 2016, SPLC agreed to reimburse us for our proportionate share of certain costs and expenses with respect to the project. We intend to finance our pro rata share of these expenditures which are not covered by reimbursement by SPLC  
  
   32 

from cash on hand or borrowings under our working capital facility. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we filed claims for reimbursement from SPLC of   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively.  
    
  We expect Auger and Lockport s maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately $  9.4 million   in 2016.  This includes   $5.5 million   for electrical and storm water improvements for Lockport and   $3.9 million   for control system improvements, safety system improvements and personnel escape pods at Ship Shoal 28 for Auger.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $3.9 million   related to these Lockport projects, and   $3.1 million   related to these Auger projects. In connection with the acquisition of Pecten effective October 1, 2015, SPLC agreed to reimburse us for certain costs and expenses incurred by Pecten for storm water improvements at Lockport. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we filed claims for reimbursement from SPLC of   $1.0 million   and   $1.2 million  , respectively. 
    
  Major Expansion Projects 
    
  We currently expect Zydeco s expansion capital expenditures to be   $5.1 million   in 2016 for Houma upgrades and expansion, including pump and electrical upgrades and a new connection.  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $0.3 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively, related to these projects. We no longer expect to incur a major capital expenditure related to a pipeline expansion in 2016 due to our entering into an alternative commercial arrangement enabling expanded service.    
    
  Customers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
    
  We transport and store crude oil and refined products for a broad mix of customers, including crude oil producers, refiners, marketers and traders, and are connected to other crude oil and refined products pipelines. In addition to serving directly-connected Gulf Coast markets, our pipelines have access to customers in various regions of the United States through interconnections with other major pipelines. Our customers use our transportation and storage services for a variety of reasons. Refiners typically require a secure and reliable supply of crude oil over a prolonged period of time to meet the needs of their specified refining diet and frequently enter into long-term firm transportation agreements to ensure a ready supply of crude oil, rate surety and sometimes sufficient transportation capacity over the life of the contract. Producers of crude oil require the ability to deliver their product to market and frequently enter into firm transportation contracts to ensure that they will have sufficient capacity available to deliver their product to delivery points with greater market liquidity. Marketers and traders generate income from buying and selling crude oil and refined products to capitalize on price differentials over time or between markets. Our customer mix can vary over time and largely depends on the crude oil and refined products supply and demand dynamics in our markets. 
    
  Competition 
    
  Our pipeline systems compete primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and with marine and rail transportation. Some of our competitors may expand or construct transportation systems that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. In addition, future pipeline transportation capacity could be constructed in excess of actual demand, which could reduce the demand for our services in the market areas we serve, and could lead to the reduction of the rates that we receive for our services. As a result of a substantial majority of our capacity being reserved on a long-term, fixed-rate basis, our revenue is not significantly affected by variation in customers  actual usage during the term of those contracts. 
    
  Our Lockport storage terminal competes with surrounding providers of storage tank services. Some of our competitors may expand or third parties may construct pipelines that bypass our location. These, or similar events, will have no immediate material impact on our Lockport operations due to our long-term contracts with contracted storage fees and payments for minimum monthly throughput volumes.  
    
  Regulation 
    
  Our assets are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies.  
    
  Under its current policy, FERC permits regulated interstate oil and gas pipelines, including those owned by master limited partnerships, to include an income tax allowance in their cost of service used to calculate cost-based transportation rates.  The allowance is intended to reflect the actual or potential tax liability attributable to the regulated entity s operating income, regardless of the form of ownership.  On July 1, 2016, in   United Airlines, Inc. v FERC  , the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated a pair of FERC orders to the extent they permitted an interstate refined petroleum products pipeline owned by a master limited partnership to include an income tax allowance in its cost-of-service-based rates.  The D.C. Circuit  
  
   33 

held that FERC had failed to demonstrate that the inclusion of an income tax allowance in the pipeline s rates would not lead to an over-recovery of costs attributable to regulated service.  The D.C. Circuit instructed FERC on remand to fashion a remedy to ensure that the pipeline s rates do not allow it to over-recover its costs.  The outcome of that proceeding could affect FERC s income tax allowance policy for cost-based rates charged by regulated pipelines going forward.  To the extent that we charge cost-of-service based rates, those rates could be affected by any changes in FERC s income tax allowance policy to the extent our rates are subject to complaint or challenge by FERC acting on its own initiative or to the extent that we propose new rates or changes to our existing rates.  
    
  On June 22, 2016, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 ( PIPES ) reauthorizing the federal pipeline safety program, was signed into law.  PIPES increases oversight and reporting of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration s ( PHMSA ) completion of mandates assigned to it under the 2011 reauthorization bill, directs the General Accounting Office to study pipeline integrity management programs, requires timely PHMSA sharing of preliminary inspection results, creates a work group to make recommendations on voluntary sharing of safety information, requires PHMSA to set minimum safety standards for natural gas storage facilities, provides new authority to PHMSA to issue industry-wide emergency orders, and expands emergency response planning requirements for navigable waters, including those covered in part by ice. We do not expect any significant changes to our safety or integrity program as a direct result of PIPES but new PHMSA regulations issued in response could lead to additional costs or operational changes. 
    
  On October 20, 2016, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ( ANOPR ) in Docket No. RM17-1-000 regarding changes to the oil pipeline rate index methodology and data reporting on the Page 700 of the FERC Form No. 6.  In an effort to improve the Commission s ability to ensure that oil pipeline rates are just and reasonable under the Interstate Commerce Act ( ICA ), the Commission is considering making the following changes to their current indexing methodologies for oil pipelines: 
    
           1) 
    Deny index increases for any pipeline whose Form No. 6, Page 700 revenues exceed costs by 15 percent for both of the prior two years; 
       
           2) 
    Deny index increases that exceed by 5 percent the cost changes reported on Page 700; and 
       
           3) 
    Apply the new criteria to costs more closely associated with the pipeline s proposed rates than with total company-wide costs and revenues now reported on Page 700. 
       
  Once the ANOPR is published in the Federal Register, initial comments will be due 45 days after publication and reply comments will be due 90 days after publication. It is too early to know the impact of this proposed regulatory change, or even if it will be adopted.  We will continue to monitor developments in this area. 
    
  For more information on federal, state and local regulations affecting our business, please read Part I, Items 1 and 2,   Business and Properties   in our 2015 Annual Report. 
    
  Acquisition Opportunities 
    
  We plan to pursue acquisitions of complementary assets from SPLC and other subsidiaries of Shell, as well as from third parties. We also may pursue acquisitions jointly with SPLC. Given the size and scope of SPLC s footprint and its significant ownership interest in us, we expect acquisitions from SPLC will be an important growth mechanism over the next few years. We executed three acquisitions from SPLC or its affiliates in 2015, including the acquisition of additional interests in Zydeco and Colonial in May 2015, the acquisition of a 36.0% interest in Poseidon in July 2015, and the acquisition of a 100.0% interest in Pecten in November 2015.  In May 2016, we completed the acquisition of additional interests in Zydeco, Bengal and Colonial, and in August 2016 we acquired a 2.62% equity interest in Explorer. On October 3, 2016, we acquired a 49.0% interest in Odyssey Pipeline L.L.C. and an additional 20.0% interest in Mars. 
    
  Neither SPLC nor any of its affiliates is under any obligation, however, to sell or offer to sell us additional assets or to pursue acquisitions jointly with us, and we are under no obligation to buy any additional assets from them or to pursue any joint acquisitions with them. We will initially focus our acquisition strategy on transportation and other midstream assets within the crude oil and refined products sectors. We believe that we will be well positioned to acquire midstream assets from SPLC, other subsidiaries of Shell, and third parties should such opportunities arise. Identifying and executing acquisitions is a key part of our strategy. However, if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or if we incur a substantial amount of debt in connection with the acquisitions, our future growth will be limited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our available cash.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 
    
  The following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or cash available for distribution in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Please read  How We Evaluate Our Operations-Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   ( Current Quarter ) compared to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   ( Comparable Quarter ) 
    
  Revenues  
    
  Total revenue decreased by $28.3 million, or 29.4%, comprised of $28.6 million attributable to transportation services revenue, partially offset by $0.3 million related to storage service revenue. 
    
  Zydeco recognized an overall decrease in transportation services revenue of $19.3 million, comprised of a decrease in revenue of $12.5 million in expiring credits on committed transportation agreements and $6.8 million in revenue related to delivered volumes. The decrease in mainline volumes was attributable to changes in certain customers  sourcing strategies, tightening of certain spreads causing a change in shipping behavior, and a decrease in spot rates due to the FERC settlement.   
    
  Pecten recognized a decrease in transportation services revenue of $9.3 million primarily attributable to expiration of the surcharge on Auger rates related to the recovery of earlier improvements on the line, a decrease in volume due to peak production on certain wells in the Comparable Quarter, and a well shut-in during the Current Quarter.  
    
  Costs and Expenses  
    
  Total costs and expenses increased $0.8 million due to $0.6 million of additional depreciation primarily due to the commencement of a capital lease for storage tanks in December 2015 and $0.4 million of higher property taxes due to changes in Zydeco property tax appraisal estimates. This increase is partially offset by $0.2 million lower general and administrative expenses. 
    
  General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.2 million due to decreased legal and expert fees in connection with the FERC rate case and costs associated with the settlement of the FERC rate case that were included in the Comparable Quarter but not in the Current Quarter. The decrease was partially offset by increased costs in the Current Quarter associated with equity issuances, as well as indemnities connected to the FERC rate case in the Comparable Quarter. 
    
  Operations and maintenance expense was unchanged due to gains on pipeline operations related to allowance oil in the Current Quarter, offset by higher insurance and maintenance costs in the Current Quarter. 

Investment, Dividend and Other Income 
    
  Investment, dividend and other income in the Current Quarter is primarily comprised of earnings from Mars, Bengal and Poseidon equity investments and the dividend income from Colonial and Explorer. The Current Quarter earnings from Mars, Bengal and Poseidon decreased by $2.7 million primarily due to lower revenue on Mars due to decreased volumes on certain wells and higher maintenance expenses, as well as tank farm flooding and related costs impacting Bengal. The increase of $1.5 million in dividend income is due to our acquisition of an additional 3.0% interest in Colonial and a 2.62% interest in Explorer in 2016.  
  
   39 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   ( Current Period ) compared to the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   ( Comparable Period ) 
    
  Revenues  
    
  Total revenue decreased by $26.2 million, or 10.8%, comprised of $26.9 million attributable to transportation services revenue, partially offset by $0.7 million related to storage service revenue. 
    
  Zydeco recognized an overall decrease in transportation services revenue of $16.6 million, comprised of a decrease in revenue of $10.3 million in expiring credits on committed transportation agreements and $6.3 million in revenue related to delivered volumes.  The decrease in mainline volumes was attributable to changes in certain customers  sourcing strategies, tightening of certain spreads throughout the Current Period causing a change in shipping behavior, and a decrease in spot rates due to the FERC settlement. Additionally, shipments on non-mainlines decreased due to a variety of maintenance events at refineries in our destination markets.  
    
  Pecten recognized a decrease in transportation services revenue of $10.3 million primarily attributable to expiration of the surcharge on Auger rates related to the recovery of earlier improvements on the line and a well shut-in during the Current Period, partially offset by an increase in Lockport revenue due to an electrical upgrade project. 
    
  Costs and Expenses  
    
  Total costs and expenses increased $2.2 million due to $2.8 million of higher operations and maintenance expenses and $1.7 million of additional depreciation primarily due to the commencement of a capital lease for storage tanks in December 2015. This increase is partially offset by $1.2 million lower property taxes due to changes in Zydeco property tax appraisal estimates and $1.1 million lower general and administrative expenses. 
    
  Operations and maintenance expenses increased by $2.8 million related to higher project development, maintenance and insurance costs in the Current Period, partially offset by gains on pipeline operations related to allowance oil in the Current Period and higher outside service costs in the Comparable Period.  
    
  General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.1 million due to decreased legal and expert fees in connection with the FERC rate case and costs associated with the settlement of the FERC rate case that were included in the Comparable Period but not in the Current Period. The decrease was partially offset by increased costs in the Current Period associated with equity issuances, as well as indemnities connected to the FERC rate case in the Comparable Period. 
    
  Investment, Dividend and Other Income 
    
  Investment, dividend and other income in the Current Period is primarily comprised of earnings from Mars, Bengal and Poseidon equity investments and the dividend income from Colonial and Explorer. The Current Period earnings from Mars, Bengal and Poseidon increased by $22.8 million primarily due to our investment in Poseidon effective July 1, 2015, as well as an increase in storage volumes at Mars resulting from the contango market conditions. The increase was partially offset by tank farm flooding and related costs impacting Bengal. The increase of $5.0 million in dividend income is due to our acquisition of an additional 3.0% interest in Colonial and a 2.62% interest in Explorer in 2016.  

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
    
  We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, we believe this access to credit along with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our short-term working capital requirements and long-term capital expenditure requirements and to make quarterly cash distributions. Our liquidity as of   September 30, 2016   was   $785.9 million   consisting of   $160.8 million   cash on hand and   $625.1 million   of available capacity under our revolving credit facilities.  
    
  On October 3, 2016, we funded the October 2016 Acquisition with $50.0 million of cash on hand and $300.0 million in borrowings under the Five Year Revolver. Our liquidity as of September 30, 2016, adjusted for the impact of the October 2016 Acquisition, would have been $435.9 consisting of $110.8 million cash on hand and $325.1 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facilities.

Revolving Credit Facility Agreements 
    
  Zydeco Revolver 
    
  Zydeco has a revolving credit facility (the  Zydeco Revolver ) with STCW, as the lender. The Zydeco Revolver has a borrowing capacity of $30.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the three-month LIBOR rate plus a margin. The credit agreement governing the Zydeco Revolver provides for covenants such as requiring pari passu ranking with any new indebtedness and contains customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due, nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts, violation of covenants, and cross-payment default (due to indebtedness in excess of $100.0 million). The Zydeco Revolver also requires payment of customary fees, including issuance and commitment fees and matures on August 6, 2019.  There were no outstanding borrowings on the Zydeco Revolver as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Five Year Revolver 
    
  In connection with the IPO, we entered into a revolving credit facility agreement (the  Five-Year Revolver ) with STCW. 
    
  On May 12, 2015, we and STCW amended and restated the Five Year Revolver to increase the borrowing capacity amount from $300.0 million to $400.0 million.  In connection with this amendment and restatement of the Five Year Revolver, we paid an issuance fee of $0.2 million. On February 22, 2016, we and STCW again amended and restated the Five Year Revolver to provide that loans advanced under the facility would have maturity dates selected by us up to October 31, 2019, the maturity date of the Five Year Revolver. This amendment and restatement allows us to roll over the outstanding balance until the maturity date of the Five Year Revolver. On September 27, 2016, we and STCW again amended and restated the Five Year Revolver to increase the borrowing capacity amount from $400.0 million to $760.0 million.  In connection with this amendment and restatement of the Five Year Revolver, we incurred an issuance fee of $0.6 million, which was paid on October 3, 2016.  All other terms and conditions of the agreement are materially unchanged. 
    
  The Five Year Revolver, as amended and restated, provides for covenants such as restricting additional indebtedness above $600.0 million and requiring pari passu ranking with any new indebtedness, and contains customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; violation of covenants, and cross-payment default (due to indebtedness in excess of $100.0 million). Borrowings under the Five Year Revolver bear interest at the three-month LIBOR rate plus a margin. The Five Year Revolver also provides for customary fees, including issuance and commitment fees. Commitment fees began to accrue on the date we entered into the Five Year Revolver. The Five Year Revolver matures on October 31, 2019. There were   $344.9 million   outstanding borrowings as of   September 30, 2016   and   $320.8 million   outstanding borrowings as of   December 31, 2015  .   
    
  364-Day Revolver 
    
  On June 29, 2015, in connection with the July 2015 Acquisition, we entered into a second revolving credit facility (the  364-Day Revolver ) with STCW with an initial borrowing capacity of $100.0 million. Loans advanced under the initial agreement would have matured on June 29, 2016.  All other terms and conditions are materially the same as those of the Five Year Revolver. 
    
  On November 11, 2015, we and STCW amended and restated the 364-Day Revolver to increase the borrowing capacity amount from $100.0 million to $180.0 million.  In connection with this amendment and restatement of the 364-Day Revolver, we paid an issuance fee of $0.1 million.  On February 22, 2016, we and STCW again amended and restated the 364-Day Revolver to extend its maturity date to March 1, 2017. All other terms and conditions of the agreement were unchanged.  
    
  There were no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of   September 30, 2016   and $  137.4 million   outstanding borrowings as of   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Related Party Debt 
    
  Borrowings under our debt facilities bear interest at the three-month LIBOR rate plus a margin. Our weighted average interest rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   2.0%  . The weighted average interest rate includes drawn and undrawn interest fees, but does not consider the amortization of debt issuance costs or capitalized interest. A 1/8 percentage point (12.5 basis points) increase in the interest rate on the total debt of   $344.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   would increase our consolidated annual interest expense by approximately   $0.4 million  . 

41 

The Five Year Revolver and the 364-Day Revolver mature in October 31, 2019 and March 1, 2017, respectively. We will need to rely on the willingness and ability of our related party lender to secure additional debt, our ability to use cash from operations and/or obtain new debt from other sources to repay/refinance such loans when they come due and/or to secure additional debt as needed.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Five Year Revolver and the 364-Day Revolver, and Zydeco was in compliance with the covenants contained in the Zydeco Revolver.  
    
  Debt of Investments 
    
  Poseidon and Colonial, two of our investments, each have third party debt. Service or repayment of such debt may impact the amount of investment income or dividend income we receive from Poseidon and Colonial, respectively, but such debt is nonrecourse to us. 
    
  Equity Registration Statements 
    
  On March 2, 2016, we commenced an  at-the-market  equity distribution program pursuant to which it may issue and sell common units of up to $300.0 million in gross proceeds. This program is registered with the SEC on an effective registration statement on Form S-3. During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, we completed the sale of   750,000   common units under this program for   $25.4 million   net proceeds (  $25.5 million   gross proceeds, or an average price of $34.00 per common unit, less   $0.1 million   of transaction fees). In connection with the issuance of the common units, we issued   15,307   general partner units to our general partner for   $0.5 million   in order to maintain its 2.0% general partner interest in us. We used the net proceeds from these sales of common units and from our general partner s proportionate capital contribution to repay borrowings outstanding under the Five Year Revolver and the 364-Day Revolver and for general partnership purposes.  During the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, we did not sell any common units under this program. 
    
  On March 29, 2016, we completed the sale of   12,650,000   common units in a registered public offering (the "March 2016 Offering") for   $395.1 million   net proceeds (  $401.6 million   gross proceeds, or   $31.75   per common unit, less   $6.3 million   of underwriter's fees and   $0.2 million   of transaction fees). In connection with the issuance of the common units, we issued   258,163   general partner units to our general partner for   $8.2 million   in order to maintain its   2.0%   general partner interest in us. We used the net proceeds from the March 2016 Offering and from our general partner s proportionate capital contribution to repay borrowings outstanding under the Five Year Revolver and the 364-Day Revolver and for general partnership purposes.  
    
     On May 23, 2016, we completed the sale of   10,500,000   common units in a registered public offering (the "May 2016 Offering") for   $345.8 million   net proceeds (  $349.1 million   gross proceeds, or $  33.25   per common unit, less   $2.9 million   of underwriter's fees and $0.4 million of transaction fees).  In connection with the issuance of common units, we issued   214,285   general partner units to our general partner for   $7.1 million   in order to maintain its   2.0%   general partner interest in us. We used the net proceeds from the May 2016 Offering and from our general partner's proportionate capital contribution to partially fund the May 2016 Acquisition.   
    
      As part of the registered public offering on May 23, 2016, the underwriters received an option to purchase an additional   1,575,000   common units, which they exercised in full on June 9, 2016 for   $51.8 million   net proceeds (  $52.4 million   gross proceeds, or $33.25 per common unit, less   $0.5 million   in underwriter's fees and   $0.1 million   in transaction fees). In connection with the issuance of common units, we issued   32,143   general partner units to our general partner for   $1.1 million   in order to maintain its 2.0% general partner interest in us. 

Cash Flows  
    
  Operating Activities  . We generated   $224.1 million   in cash flow from operating activities in the Current Period compared to   $223.8 million   in the Comparable Period.  The increase was primarily driven by increases in investment income and working capital, partially offset by a decrease in operating income and an increase in interest expense in the Current Period. 
    
  Investing Activities  . Our cash flow used in investing activities was   $131.7 million   in the Current Period compared to   $104.5 million   in the Comparable Period. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to higher book value acquired in the May 2016 Acquisition and August 2016 Acquisition as compared to the May 2015 Acquisition and the July 2015 Acquisition and an increase in expansion capital expenditures on Zydeco. This increase was partially offset by the payment of pre-IPO distributions from investments in the Comparable Period. 
  
   42 

Financing Activities  . Our cash flow used in financing activities was   $24.6 million   in the Current Period compared to    $152.0 million   used in the Comparable Period. The increase in cash flow provided by financing activities was primarily due to higher net proceeds from equity issuances, a decrease in capital distributions to the general partner, a decrease in distributions paid to noncontrolling interests and a decrease in net distribution to Parent. These increases in cash flow provided by financing activities were partially offset by the decrease in borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, and an increase in distributions paid to the unitholders and the general partner. 
    
  Capital Expenditures 
    
  Our operations can be capital intensive, requiring investments to maintain, expand, upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our capital requirements consist of maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are those made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining existing system volumes and related cash flows. In contrast, expansion capital expenditures are those made to acquire additional assets to grow our business, to expand and upgrade our systems and facilities and to construct or acquire new systems or facilities. We regularly explore opportunities to improve service to our customers and maintain or increase our assets' capacity and revenue. We may incur substantial amounts of capital expenditures in certain periods in connection with large maintenance projects that are intended to only maintain our assets' capacity or revenue. 
    
  We incurred capital expenditures of   $20.2 million   and   $10.8 million   for the Current Period and the Comparable Period, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to Houma, Port Neches and Caillou Island improvement expenditures for Zydeco, electrical and stormwater improvements for Lockport and control system improvements, safety system improvements and personnel escape pods at Ship Shoal 28 for Auger in the Current Quarter. 
    
  A summary of our capital expenditures is shown in the table below: 

(1)        The 2015 financial information has been retrospectively adjusted for the acquisition of the Shell Auger and Lockport Operations. 

43 

We expect total capital expenditures to be approximately   $31.9 million   for 2016, the remaining estimated capital expenditures for the fourth quarter 2016 is $  11.7 million  , a summary of which is shown in the table below: 

We currently expect Zydeco s maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately $  6.3 million   for the fourth quarter 2016. Approximately   $2.8 million   is to replace a two-mile section of a 22-inch diameter pipe under the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Shaffer. In connection with both the May 2015 Acquisition and the May 2016 Acquisition, SPLC agreed to reimburse us for our proportionate share of certain costs and expenses incurred by Zydeco with respect to this pipeline replacement project. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , Zydeco has incurred   $0.3 million   capitalized costs related to this project. 
    
  Zydeco's remaining maintenance capital expenditures of approximately   $3.5 million   for the fourth quarter 2016 are related to improvements at Houma and Port Neches. We expect Auger and Lockport s remaining maintenance capital expenditures, to be approximately   $2.4 million   for the fourth quarter 2016.  This includes   $1.6 million   for electrical and storm water improvements for Lockport, and   $0.8 million   for control system improvements, safety system improvements and personnel escape pods at Ship Shoal 28 for Auger. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $2.6 million   and $  11.1 million  , respectively related to these Zydeco projects,   $2.4 million   and   $3.9 million  , respectively, related to these Lockport projects and   $1.7 million   and   $3.1 million  , respectively, related to these Auger projects. 
    
  We currently expect Zydeco s expansion capital expenditures to be   $3.0 million   in the fourth quarter 2016 for a new connection at Houma. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Zydeco has incurred   $0.3 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively related to Houma upgrades and expansion projects. We no longer expect to incur a major capital expenditure related to a pipeline expansion in 2016 due to our entering into an alternative commercial arrangement enabling expanded service. We expect expansion capital expenditures for Lockport and Auger to remain immaterial. 
    
  With the exception of the Zydeco pipeline replacement project, we anticipate that both maintenance and expansion capital expenditures for the remainder of the year will be funded primarily with cash from operations.  
    
  In addition to these planned projects, we anticipate Zydeco undertaking a tank expansion project in Houma to address future potential capacity shortfalls during tank maintenance. If this project receives necessary corporate approval, the majority of the capital expenditures are expected to be incurred in 2017 and 2018. 

44 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  A summary of our contractual obligations, as of   September 30, 2016  , is shown in the table below (in millions): 

(1)        Includes   $41.3 million   in interest,   $22.8 million   in principal and   $11.2 million   in executory costs  . 
    
  On December 1, 2014, we entered into a terminal services agreement with a related party in which we were to take possession of certain storage tanks storage tanks located in Port Neches, Texas, effective December 1, 2015. On October 26, 2015, the terminal services agreement was amended to provide for an interim in-service period for the purposes of commissioning the tanks in which we paid a nominal monthly fee. Our capitalized costs and related capital lease obligation commenced effective December 1, 2015. Upon the in-service date of September 1, 2016, our monthly lease payment was increased to   $0.4 million  . In the eighteenth month after the in-service date, actual fixed and variable costs will be compared to premised costs. If the actual and premised operating costs differ by more than 5.0%, the lease will be adjusted accordingly and this adjustment will be effective for the remainder of the lease.  
    
  On September 1, 2016, which is the in-service date of the capital lease for the Port Neches storage tanks, a joint tariff agreement with a third party became effective and requires monthly payments of approximately $0.4 million. The tariff will be analyzed annually and updated based on the FERC indexing adjustment to rates effective July 1 of each year. The initial term of the agreement is ten years with automatic one year renewal terms with the option to cancel prior to each renewal period. 

45 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities. 
    
  Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs 
    
  We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to obtain permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, remediate environmental damage from any discharge of petroleum or chemical substances from our facilities or install additional pollution control equipment on our equipment and facilities. Our failure to comply with these or any other environmental or safety-related regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities, and the issuance of injunctions that may subject us to additional operational constraints. 
    
  Future additional expenditures may be required to comply with the Clean Air Act and other federal, state and local requirements for our assets. These requirements could result in additional compliance costs and additional operating restrictions on our business, each of which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 
    
  If we do not recover these expenditures through the rates and other fees we receive for our services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of competitor and location of its operating facilities. 
    
  We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  Our critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth in Part II, Item 7  ,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   in our 2015 Annual Report. As of   September 30, 2016   there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our 2015 Annual Report was filed.

Item 5. Other Information 
    
  Disclosures Required Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
    
  In accordance with our General Business Principles and Code of Conduct, Shell Midstream Partners seeks to comply with all applicable international trade laws including applicable sanctions and embargoes.  
    
  Under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, and Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), we are required to include certain disclosures in our periodic reports if we or any of our  affiliates  (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during the period covered by the report. Because the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) defines the term  affiliate  broadly, it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controls us or is under common control with us.  
    
  The activities listed below have been conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates of Royal Dutch Shell plc that may be deemed to be under common  control  with us. The disclosure does not relate to any activities conducted directly by us or our general partner, Shell Midstream Partners GP LLC (the  General Partner ) and does not involve our or the General Partner s management.  
    
  For purposes of this disclosure, we refer to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries other than us, the General Partner and Shell Midstream LP Holdings LLC as the  RDS Group . References to actions taken by the RDS Group mean actions taken by the applicable RDS Group company.  None of the payments disclosed below was made in U.S. dollars, however, for disclosure purposes, all have been converted into U.S. dollars at the appropriate exchange rate. We do not believe that any of the transactions or activities listed below violated U.S. sanctions.  
    
  In 2010, the RDS Group ceased all of its upstream commercial activities in Iran and suspended new business development in Iran, as a direct consequence of the international sanctions imposed on the country. In 2013, the RDS Group closed its small representative office in Iran.  However, as a result of the suspension of US and European Union (EU) sanctions, the RDS Group is currently considering potential opportunities in Iran. 
    
  The RDS Group maintains accounts with Bank Karafarin, where its cash deposits (balance of $3.3 million at September 30, 2016) generated non-taxable interest income of $0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The RDS Group paid $3 in bank commissions during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
    
  Payments to the Iranian Civil Aviation Authority for the clearance of overflight permits for RDS Group aircraft over Iranian airspace amounted to $476 during the three months ended September 30, 2016. There was no gross revenue or net profit associated with these transactions. On occasion, RDS Group aircraft may be routed over Iran and therefore these payments may continue in the future. 
  
   49 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, RDS Group officials met with Iranian officials in Iran. In relation to these travelling RDS Group officials, an amount of $4,328 was paid to the Iranian Authorities for visas, airport service and exit fees. An amount of $47 was paid for travel insurance to Bimeh Insurance Company and $398 was paid to Iranian Airlines for airline tickets. There was no gross revenue or net profit associated with the above transactions.  The RDS Group expects to continue discussions with Iranian officials and therefore similar payments may continue in the future. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, the RDS Group has outstanding with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) a receivable of $10.5 million associated with the RDS Group s previous upstream business activities conducted prior to the EU sanctions.  The RDS Group intends to resolve these outstanding balances at the earliest possible time.  
    
  On May 31, 2016, through RDS Group subsidiary Shell International Eastern Trading Company, the RDS Group purchased a cargo of oil from NIOC for $45.2 million.  The cargo was sold to an RDS Group refinery.  A profit of $1.12 million has been recognized as resulting from this transaction. In the future, the RDS Group intends to continue to consider business opportunities with NIOC, including the purchase and trading of oil.
