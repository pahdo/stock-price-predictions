EXPLANATORY
NOTE   

On
October 15, 2015, SG Blocks, Inc. ( SGB ) and its subsidiaries SG Building Blocks, Inc. ( SG Building )
and Endaxi Infrastructure Group, Inc. (each a  Subsidiary,  together, the  Subsidiaries  and together
with SGB, the  Debtors ), filed voluntary petitions (the  Bankruptcy Petitions ) for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Southern District of New York (the  Bankruptcy Court ). The Debtors filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking
joint administration of their Chapter 11 cases under the caption  In re SG Blocks, Inc. et al.  , Case No. 15-12790 (such
proceeding, the  Bankruptcy Proceeding ). After filing such voluntary petitions the Debtors operated their businesses
as  debtors-in-possession  under jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court until the Effective Date (as defined below). On February 29, 2016, the
Debtors filed a Disclosure Statement (the  Disclosure Statement ), attaching a Plan of Reorganization (the  Plan ),
along with a motion seeking approval of the Disclosure Statement by the Bankruptcy Court. On June 30, 2016 (the  Effective
Date ), the Plan became effective and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy.  

On
October 15, 2015, SGB, as borrower, and its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a Debtor in Possession Credit Agreement
(the  DIP Credit Agreement  and the loans thereunder, the  DIP Loan ) with Hillair Capital Investments
L.P. ( HCI ), and, as condition to the making of the DIP Loan, SGB and its subsidiaries entered into that Senior Security
Agreement (the  DIP Security Agreement  and together with the DIP Credit Agreement and the other documents entered
into in connection therewith, the  DIP Facility ), also dated as of October 15, 2015, with Hillair Capital Management
LLC ( HCM ) pursuant to which SGB and its subsidiaries granted HCM a first priority security interest in all of their
respective assets for the benefit of HCI. The DIP Loan had a maximum principal amount of $600,000, bore interest at a rate of
12% and was due and payable upon the earlier to occur of April 15, 2016 or other dates specified in the DIP Credit Agreement,
and required SGB to pay a collateral fee of $25,000. The DIP Loan became due on April 15, 2016 but was not repaid until the Effective
Date as described below. The funds advanced under the DIP Facility were used by SGB to fund its operation during the Bankruptcy
Proceeding, including payment of professional fees and expenses. On the Effective Date and in accordance with the Plan, the DIP
Facility was repaid in full and the related DIP Credit Agreement was terminated.  

On
the Effective Date, and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, SGB entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated June 30, 2016,
(the  2016 SPA ), pursuant to which SGB sold for a subscription price of $2.0 million a 12% Original Issue Discount
Senior Secured Convertible Debenture to HCI in the principal amount of $2.5 million, with a maturity date of June 30, 2018 (the
 Exit Facility ). The Exit Facility is convertible at HCI s option at any time in whole or in part into shares
of New Common Stock (as defined below) at a ratio of 1 share for every $1.25 of debt. Pursuant to that certain Subsidiary Guaranty
Agreement, effective as of the Effective Date (the  Guarantee Agreement ), by SG Building in favor of HCI, SG Building
unconditionally guaranteed (the  Guarantee ) the obligations and indebtedness owed to HCI under the Exit Facility
and the Guarantee is secured by a first-priority lien and security interest on all of the Guarantor s assets. The Exit Facility
and SG Building s obligations under the Guarantee are secured by a first-priority lien and security interest on all of the
Company s and SG Building s assets pursuant to that certain Security Agreement, dated as of the Effective Date, by
and between the Company, SG Building and HCI (the  Security Agreement ). The Exit Facility will be used (i) to make
a one hundred percent (100%) distribution for payment of unsecured claims in accordance with the Plan, (ii) to pay all costs of
the administration of SGB s Bankruptcy, (iii) to pay all amounts owed under the DIP Facility and (iv) for general working
capital purposes of SGB. As of September 30, 2016, in accordance with the Plan, 75% of the unsecured claims have been paid as
well as amount owed under the DIP Facility.  

Prior
to the Effective Date, SGB was authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (the  Former Common
Stock ) of which 42,918,927 shares were issued and outstanding as of June 29, 2016. On the Effective Date, all previously
issued and outstanding shares of the Former Common Stock were deemed discharged, cancelled and extinguished, and, pursuant to
the Plan, SGB issued, in the aggregate, 491,357 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (the  New Common Stock ),
to the holders of Former Common Stock, representing 7.5% of SGB s issued and outstanding New Common Stock, after taking
into account full exercise of the Management Options (as defined below) and conversion of the New Preferred Stock (as defined
below) but prior to any conversion of the Exit Facility, as of the Effective Date. Further, under the Plan, upon the Effective
Date certain members of SGB s management were entitled to receive options ( Management Options ) to acquire
an aggregate of 10%, or approximately 655,153 shares, of SGB s New Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis, assuming conversion
of all of the New Preferred Stock but not the Exit Facility. On October 26, 2016, SGB has authorized the Management Options to
be issued.  

Prior
to the Effective Date, SGB was authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 (the  Former Preferred
Stock ) none of which was issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date. On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms
of the Plan and SGB s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, SGB filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware a Certificate of Designations of Convertible Preferred Stock, designating 5,405,010 shares of preferred stock, par
value $1.00 (the  New Preferred Stock ). As described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with
the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on July 7, 2016 (the  July 8-K ), on the Effective Date
and pursuant to the Plan, each Prepetition Loan Document (as defined in the July 8-K) was cancelled and the holders of debt thereunder
received one share of the New Preferred Stock for each dollar owed by SGB thereunder. The New Preferred Stock is convertible into
New Common Stock on a 1:1 basis and, if converted on the Effective Date, would convert into 82.5% of the New Common Stock issued
and outstanding on the Effective Date, after taking into account shares of New Common Stock issued to holders of the Former Common
Stock and the exercise of the Management Options but prior to any conversion of the Exit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, the
potential amount has not changed. On the Effective Date, HCI received 5,405,010 shares of the Company s preferred stock
which is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock. Since each share of the Company s preferred stock
is able to vote on an as converted basis HCI effectively has a controlling interest in the Company of 51.17% on an as converted
basis. As of September 30, 2016, the potential controlling interest percentage has not changed.  

Also
as described in the July 8-K, all general unsecured claims shall receive a distribution of one hundred percent of its allowed
claim, plus post-petition interest calculated at the Federal judgment rate, payable as follows: fifty percent on the Effective
Date, twenty five percent at the conclusion of the next full fiscal quarter after the Effective Date and the remaining twenty
five percent, plus any post-petition interest owed, at the conclusion of the second full fiscal quarter after the Effective Date.
As of September 30, 2016, twenty five percent of the general unsecured claims are due.

the post-Effective Date common stock of SGB shall be deemed references to New Common Stock.

1.   
       Description
    of Business    

SG
Blocks, Inc. (the  Company ) was previously known as CDSI Holdings, Inc. (a Delaware corporation incorporated on December
29, 1993). On November 4, 2011, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary was merged with and into SG Building Blocks, Inc.
( SG Building , formerly SG Blocks Inc.) (the  Merger ), with SG Building surviving the Merger and becoming
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger was a reverse merger that was accounted for as a recapitalization of SG Building
as SG Building was the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the historical financial statements presented are the financial statements
of SG Building.  

The
Company is a provider of code engineered cargo shipping containers that it modifies and delivers to meet the growing demand for
safe and green for commercial, industrial and residential building construction. Rather than consuming new steel and lumber, it
capitalizes on the structural engineering and design parameters a shipping container must meet and repurposes them for use in
building. It offers the construction industry a safer, greener, faster, longer lasting and more economical alternative to conventional
construction methods.  

The
Company also provides engineering and project management services related to the use of modified containers in construction.  

During
2011, the Company formed SG Blocks Sistema De Constucao Brasileiro LTDA. ( SG Brazil ), a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. SG Brazil is currently inactive. During 2015, the Company formed Endaxi Infrastructure Group, Inc. ( Endaxi ),
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is currently inactive.  

2.   
       Liquidity
    and Financial Condition    

On
October 15, 2015, the Company filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York (the  Bankruptcy Court ). On June 3, 2016, the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York confirmed the Company s plan of reorganization (the  Plan ). The
Plan became effective, and the Company emerged from bankruptcy on June 30, 2016 (the  Effective Date ).  

On
October 15, 2015, the Company, as borrower, and its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a Debtor in Possession Credit Agreement
(the  DIP Credit Agreement  and the loans thereunder, the  DIP Loan ) with Hillair Capital Investments
L.P. ( HCI ), and, as a condition to the making of the DIP Loan, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into a Senior
Security Agreement (the  DIP Security Agreement  and together with the DIP Credit Agreement and the other documents
entered into in connection therewith, the  DIP Facility ), also dated as of October 15, 2015, with Hillair Capital
Management LLC ( HCM ) pursuant to which SGB and its subsidiaries granted HCM a first priority security interest in
all of their respective assets for the benefit of HCI. The DIP Loan had a maximum principal amount of $600,000, bore interest
at a rate of 12% and was due and payable upon the earlier to occur of April 15, 2016 and other dates specified in the DIP Credit
Agreement, and required the Company to pay a collateral fee of $25,000. The DIP Loan became due on April 15, 2016 but was not
repaid until the Effective Date as described below. The funds advanced under the DIP Facility were used by the Company to fund
its operation during the Bankruptcy Proceeding, including payment of professional fees and expenses. On the Effective Date and
in accordance with the Plan, the DIP Facility was repaid in full and the related DIP Credit Agreement was terminated.  

On
the Effective Date, and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated June
30, 2016, (the  2016 SPA ), pursuant to which the Company sold, for a subscription price of $2,000,000, a 12% Original
Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture to HCI in the principal amount of $2,500,000, with a maturity date of June
30, 2018 (the  Exit Facility ). The Exit Facility is convertible at HCI s   option at any time in whole
or in part into shares of New Common Stock (as defined below) at a ratio of 1 share for every $1.25 of debt. Pursuant to that
certain Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement, effective as of the Effective Date (the  Guarantee Agreement ), by SG Building
in favor of HCI, SG Building unconditionally guaranteed (the  Guarantee ) the obligations and indebtedness owed to
HCI under the Exit Facility. The Exit Facility and SG Building s obligations under the Guarantee are secured by a first-priority
lien and security interest on all of the Company s and SG Building s assets pursuant to that certain Security Agreement,
dated as of the Effective Date, by and between the Company, SG Building and HCI (the  Security Agreement ). The Exit
Facility will be used (i) to make a one hundred percent (100%) distribution for payment of unsecured claims in accordance with
the Plan, (ii) to pay all costs of the administration of SGB s Bankruptcy, (iii) to pay all amounts owed under the DIP Facility
and (iv) for general working capital purposes of the Company. As of September 30, 2016, in accordance with the Plan, 75% of the
unsecured claims have been paid as well as amount owed under the DIP Facility.  

Prior
to the Effective Date, the Company was authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (the  Former
Common Stock ) of which 42,918,927 shares were issued and outstanding as of June 29, 2016. On the Effective Date, all previously
issued and outstanding shares of the Former Common Stock were deemed discharged, cancelled and extinguished, and, pursuant to
the Plan, SGB issued, in the aggregate, 491,357 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (the  New Common Stock ),
to the holders of Former Common Stock, representing 7.5% of SGB s issued and outstanding New Common Stock, after taking
into account full exercise of the Management Options (as defined below) and conversion of the New Preferred Stock (as defined
below) but prior to any conversion of the Exit Facility, as of the Effective Date. Further, under the Plan, upon the Effective
Date certain members of the Company s management were entitled to receive options ( Management Options ) to
acquire an aggregate of 10%, or approximately 655,153 shares, of SGB s New Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis, assuming
conversion of all of the New Preferred Stock but not the Exit Facility. On October 26, 2016, SGB has authorized the Management
Options to be issued.

2.   
       Liquidity
    and Financial Condition  (continued)     

Prior
to the Effective Date, the Company was authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 (the  Former
Preferred Stock ) none of which was issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date. On the Effective Date, pursuant
to the terms of the Plan and the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations of Convertible Preferred Stock, designating 5,405,010
shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 (the  New Preferred Stock ). As described in the Current Report on Form
8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on July 7, 2016 (as amended, the  July 8-K ), on the Effective Date and pursuant
to the Plan, each Prepetition Loan Document (as defined in the July 8-K) was cancelled and the holders of debt thereunder received
one share of the New Preferred Stock for each dollar owed by the Company thereunder. The New Preferred Stock is convertible into
New Common Stock on a 1:1 basis and, if converted on the Effective Date, would convert into 82.5% of the New Common Stock issued
and outstanding on the Effective Date, after taking into account shares of New Common Stock issued to holders of the Former Common
Stock and the exercise of the Management Options but prior to any conversion of the Exit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, the
potential amount has not changed. On the Effective Date, HCI received 5,405,010 shares of the Company s preferred stock
which is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock. Since each share of the Company s preferred stock
is able to vote on an as converted basis HCI effectively has a controlling interest in the Company of 51.17% on an as converted
basis. As of September 30, 2016, the potential controlling interest percentage has not changed.  

Also
as described in the July 8-K, all general unsecured claims shall receive a distribution of one hundred percent of its allowed
claim, plus post-petition interest calculated at the Federal judgment rate, payable as follows: fifty percent on the Effective
Date, twenty five percent at the conclusion of the next full fiscal quarter after the Effective Date and the remaining twenty
five percent, plus any post-petition interest owed, at the conclusion of the second full fiscal quarter after the Effective Date.
These claims have been identified as subject to compromise on the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2016, twenty five percent
of the general unsecured claims are due.  

Upon
the Company's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh start accounting, pursuant to the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC 852,  Reorganizations , and applied the provisions thereof to its financial
statements. The Company qualified for fresh start accounting because (i) the holders of existing voting shares of the pre-emergence
debtor-in-possession, referred to herein to as the  Predecessor  or  Predecessor Company,  received less
than 50% of the voting shares of the post-emergence successor entity, which we refer to herein as the  Successor 
or  Successor Company  and (ii) the reorganization value of the Company's assets immediately prior to confirmation
was less than the post-petition liabilities and allowed claims. The Company applied fresh start accounting on June 30, 2016 when
it emerged from bankruptcy protection. Adopting fresh start accounting results in a new reporting entity for financial reporting
purposes with no beginning retained earnings or deficit. The cancellation of all existing shares outstanding on the Effective
Date and issuance of new shares of the Successor Company caused a related change of control of the Company under ASC 852. Upon
the application of fresh start accounting, the Company allocated the reorganization value to its individual assets based on their
estimated fair values. Reorganization value represents the fair value of the Successor Company's assets before considering liabilities.
As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, the Consolidated
Financial Statements on or after June 30, 2016 are not comparable with the Consolidated Financial Statements prior to that date.
References to  Successor  or  Successor Company  relate to the financial position and results of operations
of the reorganized Company subsequent to June 30, 2016. References to  Predecessor  or  Predecessor Company 
refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to June 30, 2016.   

Reorganization
value represents the fair value of the Successor Company s net assets and is intended to approximate the amount a willing
buyer would pay for the net assets immediately after restructuring. Under fresh start accounting, we allocated the reorganization
value to our individual assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. Our reorganization value is derived from
an estimate of enterprise value. Enterprise value represents the estimated fair value of an entity s long term debt and
shareholders  equity. In support of the Plan, the enterprise value of the Successor Company was estimated to be approximately
$8,551,528. The valuation analysis was prepared using financial information and financial projections and applying standard valuation
techniques and including risked net asset value analysis.  

The Company identified an embedded derivative related
to the convertible option feature included in the convertible debentures. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments
requires the Company to bifurcate and fair value the derivative as of the inception date of the convertible debentures and to fair
value the derivative as of each subsequent reporting date. Upon issuance of the convertible debentures on June 30, 2016, the Company
received net proceeds of $1,319,001, net of the payoff of $600,000 debtor-in-possession financing and $35,848 in interest expense
on such financing, recorded a discount of $500,000, reimbursed HCI for $45,151 of reorganization costs paid by HCI, and recognized
a derivative financial instrument approximating $394,460. After these adjustments, the Company s debt was $1,605,540. The
difference between the $2,500,000 face amount and the fair value recorded in fresh-start accounting is being amortized over two
years, the current expected life of the debt. The fair value of the convertible options was estimated using a Black-Scholes pricing
model with the following assumptions: stock price of $1.00; strike price of $1.25; expected volatility of 48.8%; risk free interest
rate of 0.58%; expiration date of two years. The fair value of these convertible options was estimated using Level 3 inputs. 

The
adjustments set forth in the following condensed consolidated balance sheet reflect the effect of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Plan (reflected in the column  Reorganization Adjustments ) as well as fair value adjustments
as a result of the adoption of fresh start accounting (reflected in the column  Fresh Start Adjustments ). The explanatory
notes highlight methods used to determine fair values or other amounts of the assets and liabilities as well as significant assumptions.

Reorganization
Items     

Reorganization
items represent amounts incurred subsequent to the bankruptcy filing as a direct result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases
and are comprised of the following:  

The current level of cash and operating margins is
not enough to cover the existing fixed and variable obligations of the Company, so increased revenue performance and the addition
of capital through issuances of securities are critical to the Company s success. At November 7, 2016, the Company had a
cash balance of approximately $241,000. The Company expects that through the next eighteen months, the capital requirements to
fund the Company s growth will consume all of the cash flows that it expects to generate from its operations, as well as
any proceeds of any other issuances of senior convertible debt securities. The Company further believes that during this period,
while the Company is focusing on the growth and expansion of its business, the gross profit that it expects to generate from operations
will not generate sufficient funds to cover expected operating costs. Accordingly, the Company requires further external funding
to sustain operations and to follow through on the execution of its business plan. There is no assurance that the Company s
plans will materialize or that the Company will be successful in funding estimated cash shortfalls through additional debt or equity
capital and through the cash generated by the Company s operations. Given these conditions, the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern is contingent upon it being able to secure an adequate amount of debt or equity capital to enable it
to meet its cash requirements. In addition, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light
of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered by entrants into established markets, the competitive environment
in which the Company operates and the current capital raising environment. 

Since
inception, the Company s operations have primarily been funded through proceeds from equity and debt financings and sales
activity. Although management believes that the Company has access to capital resources, there are currently no commitments in
place for additional financing at this time, and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain funds on commercially
acceptable terms, if at all.  

These
factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company s financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should it be unable to continue as a going
concern.

       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies    

Interim
financial information       The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and notes required by GAAP for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting
of normal accruals, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial statements have been included. Results
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
the year ending December 31, 2016.  

The
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes for
the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on July 21, 2016.  

Basis
of consolidation       The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries, SG Building, SG Brazil and Endaxi. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

Accounting
estimates         The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant areas which require the Company to make estimates
include revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, warrant liabilities, allowance for doubtful accounts and a valuation for
deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Operating
cycle       The length of the Company s contracts varies, but is typically between six to twelve months.
Assets and liabilities relating to long-term contracts are included in current assets and current liabilities in the accompanying
balance sheets as they will be liquidated in the normal course of contract completion, which at times could exceed one year.  

Revenue
recognition       The Company accounts for its long-term contracts associated with the design, engineering, manufacture
and project management of building projects and related services, using the percentage-of-completion accounting method. Under
this method, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the long-term contract. The Company uses
the cost to cost basis because management considers it to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts.  

Contract
costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance. General and administrative
costs, marketing and business development expenses and pre-project expenses are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for
estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance,
job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions, and final contract settlements
may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. An amount
equal to contract costs attributable to claims is included in revenue when realization is probable and the amount can be reliably
estimated.  

The
asset,  Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billing on uncompleted contracts,  represents revenue recognized
in excess of amounts billed. The liability,  Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts, 
represents billing in excess of revenue recognized.  

The
Company offers a one-year warranty on completed contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the warranty
claims were not material. The Company does not anticipate that any additional claims are likely to occur for warranties that are
currently outstanding. Accordingly, no warranty reserve is considered necessary for any of the periods presented.  

The
Company also supplies repurposed containers to its customers. In these cases, the Company serves as a supplier to its customers
for standard and made to order products that it sells at fixed prices. Revenue from these contracts is generally recognized when
the products have been delivered to the customer, accepted by the customer and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized
upon completion of the following: an order for product is received from a customer; written approval for the payment schedule
is received from the customer and the corresponding required deposit or payments are received; a common carrier signs documentation
accepting responsibility for the unit as agent for the customer; and the unit is delivered to the customer s receiving point.
The title and risk of loss passes to the customer at the customer s receiving point.  

Amounts
billed to customers in a sales transaction for shipping and handling are classified as revenue. Products sold are generally paid
for based on schedules provided for in each individual customer contract including upfront deposits and progress payments as products
are being manufactured.  

Funds
received in advance of meeting the criteria for revenue recognition are deferred and are recorded as revenue when they are earned.

       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies  (continued)     

Inventory
      Raw construction materials (primarily shipping containers) are valued at the lower of costs (first-in,
first-out method) or market. Finished goods and work-in-process inventories are valued at the lower of costs or market, using
the specific identification method. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, inventory consisted principally of work-in-process
inventory, which amounted to $138,427 and $158,181, respectively.  

Goodwill
      Goodwill represents the excess of reorganization value over fair-value of identified net assets upon emergence
from bankruptcy. In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, the Company performs its impairment test of goodwill
at the reporting unit level each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying values.  

Intangible
assets       Intangible assets represent the preliminary assets identified upon emergence from bankruptcy and
consist of $2,766,000 of proprietary knowledge and technology which is being amortized over 20 years and $1,113,000 of customer
contracts which is being amortized over 2.5 years. The accumulated amortization and amortization expense as of and for the nine
months ended was $145,875. The estimated amortization expense for the successive five years is as follows:  

Fair
value measurements       Financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities are carried at cost, which the Company believes approximates fair value due to the short-term
nature of these instruments.  

The
Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an
asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company maximizes the use of observable inputs
and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  

The
Company uses three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level
    1  
      Quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   
 
      Level
    2  
      Quoted
    prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable.   
 
      Level
    3  
      Inputs
    that are unobservable (for example, cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions).   

Financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:

       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies  (continued)     

Warrant
and conversion option liabilities are measured at fair value using the Black-Scholes model and are classified within Level 3 of
the valuation hierarchy. For fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Company s
Chief Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, determines its valuation policies and procedures. The development
and determination of the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility
of the Company s Chief Financial Officer and are approved by the Chief Executive Officer.  

The
following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial liabilities that
are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  

The
significant assumptions and valuation methods that the Company used to determine fair value and the change in fair value of the
Company s derivative financial instruments are discussed in Notes 6 and 8.  

The
Company presented warrant and conversion option liabilities at fair value on its condensed consolidated balance sheets, with the
corresponding changes in fair value recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the applicable
reporting periods. As disclosed in Note 6, the Company computed the fair value of the warrant and conversion option liability
at the date of issuance and the reporting dates of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 using a Black-Scholes model.  

The calculation of the Black-Scholes model involves
the use of the fair value of the Company s common stock, estimated term, volatility, risk-free interest rates and dividend
yield (if applicable). The Company developed the assumptions that were used as follows: The fair value of the Company s common
stock was obtained from the terms of the recapitalization of the Company including the Exit Facility, which occurred concurrent
with the Company s emergence from bankruptcy protection. The term represents the remaining contractual term of the derivative;
the volatility rate was developed based on analysis of the Company s historical stock price volatility and the historical
volatility rates of several other similarly situated companies (using a number of observations that was at least equal to or exceeded
the number of observations in the life of the derivative financial instrument at issue); the risk free interest rates were obtained
from publicly available US Treasury yield curve rates; the dividend yield is zero because the Company has not paid dividends and
does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.

       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies  (continued)     

Concentrations
of credit risk       Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk,
consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash with high credit quality institutions. At times,
such amounts may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such account and believes
that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on the account.  

With
respect to receivables, concentrations of credit risk are limited to a few customers in the construction industry. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers  financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its
customers other than normal lien rights. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 68% and 74%, respectively, of the Company s
accounts receivable were due from two customers, respectively.  

Revenue
relating to two customers represented approximately 73% and 12% of the Company s total revenue for the three months ended
September 30, 2016. Revenue relating to one customer represented approximately 19% of the Company s total revenue for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue relating to two customers represented approximately 36% and 35% of the Company s
total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Revenue relating to four customers represented approximately 25%,
18%, 13% and 12% of the Company s total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Costs
of revenue relating to one vendor, who is a related party and disclosed in Note 10, represented approximately 53% and 91% of the
Company s total cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Costs of revenue relating to one
unrelated vendor represented approximately 11% of the Company s total cost of revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2016.Costs of revenue relating to one vendor, who is a related party and disclosed in Note 10, represented approximately 37%
and 45% of the Company s total cost of revenue for the nine months ended September, 2016 and 2015. Costs of revenue relating
to one unrelated vendor represented approximately 30% and 24%, respectively, of the Company s total cost of revenue for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company believes it has access to alternative suppliers, with limited disruption
to the business, should circumstances change with its existing suppliers.   

Recent
accounting pronouncements       In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ), which
creates Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue
Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.
In addition, ASU 2014-09 supersedes the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition --Construction-Type and Production-Type
Contracts, and creates new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs -- Contracts with Customers. In summary, the core
principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Additionally, ASU 2014-09 requires enhanced financial statement disclosures over revenue recognition as part of the new accounting
guidance. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within that reporting period, and early application is permitted commencing January 1, 2017. The Company is currently
evaluating the provisions of ASU 2014-09 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on its financial position and results of
operations.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014 -15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern. The Update provides U.S. GAAP
guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue
as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate
whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern within
one year from the date the financial statements are issued. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed
Accounting Standards Update 2013 - 300 --Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an
Entity's Going Concern Presumption, which has been deleted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014 -15 on
the financial statements.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The update requires inventory
not measured using either the last in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method to be measured at the lower of cost and
net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The Company is currently
evaluating the effects of ASU 2015-11 on the financial statements.

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The updates principle objective is to increase transparency
and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 continues
to retain a distinction between finance and operating leases but requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset representing
its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases
with terms greater than twelve months. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption
is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of
ASU 2016-02 on the financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The update makes several modifications
to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation, and the financial
statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation
for certain components of share-based awards. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early
adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The Company is currently evaluating the effects
of ASU 2016-09 on the financial statements.

Predecessor
Company     

On
April 10, 2014, the Company entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with Hillair Capital
Investments L.P. ( Hillair ), Frank Casano ( Casano ) and Scott Masterson ( Masterson ) who
held certain existing Senior Convertible Debentures (the  Existing Debentures ). Existing Debentures consisted of:
(a) debentures issued and sold to Hillair in December 2012 (the  2012 Hillair Debentures ) and (b) debentures issued
and sold to Casano and Masterson in April 2013 (the  April 2013 Debentures ). Under the terms of the Exchange Agreement,
Existing Debentures with a stated maturity value of $1,680,000 were surrendered in exchange for (i) new Senior Convertible Debentures
with a stated interest rate of eight percent (8%) per year, a stated maturity value of $1,915,200, a conversion price of $0.25
per share, subject to adjustment, with a final maturity date of April 1, 2016 (the  2014 Exchange Debentures ), and
(ii) a five (5) year Common Stock purchase warrant to purchase up to 7,660,800 shares of the Company s common stock at an
exercise price of $0.275 (110% of the conversion price), subject to adjustment (the  2014 Exchange Warrants ). At
April 10, 2014, the carrying value of Existing Debentures was $1,680,000 and the fair value of the conversion option liability
was $2,366. The fair value of the conversion option liability of the 2014 Exchange Debentures was determined to be $380,744 and
the fair value of the warrants issued was determined to be $490,601 upon issuance of the Exchange Debentures. The Company recognized
a loss of $1,104,179 on this exchange transaction upon issuance of the Exchange Debentures. In connection with the Exchange Agreement,
the Company incurred $20,763 in legal fees which are included in debt issuance costs in the accompanying condensed consolidated
balance sheets at December 31, 2015.  

On
April 10, 2014, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  2014 SPA ) with four investors, including
Hillair pursuant to which the Company issued and sold (i) $2,080,500 in 8% Original Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debentures,
for $1,825,000, with a conversion price of $0.25 per share, subject to adjustment, with a final maturity date of April 1, 2016 (the
 2014 New Debentures  together with the 2014 Exchange Debentures, the  2014 Debentures ), and (ii) a five
(5) year Common Stock purchase warrant to purchase up to 8,322,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price
of $0.275 (110% of the conversion price), subject to adjustment with a fair value of $532,944 at issuance, which has been recorded
as a discount to the 2014 New Debentures. (As disclosed in Note 8) The Company recorded a discount of $255,500, which is being
amortized over the term of the 2014 New Debentures, using the effective interest method. The initial conversion price for the
2014 New Debentures is $0.25 per share, subject to adjustments upon certain events, as set forth in the 2014 New Debentures. At
the date of issuance the fair value of the conversion option liability was determined to be $413,606, which has been recorded
as a discount to the 2014 New Debentures. In connection with the 2015 New Debentures, the Company incurred $20,000 in legal fees
which are included in debt issuance costs in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015. As of
December 31, 2015, the discount related to the 2015 New Debentures amounted to $387,965.  

The
Exchange Agreement and the 2015 SPA triggered anti-dilution adjustments to the warrants issued on the Existing Debentures based
on a $0.25 per share conversion price (adjusted from the original stated conversion price of $0.43 per share), which reduced the
exercise price to $0.25 per share and increased the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of the Existing Warrants from
4,818,605 to 8,288,000 shares.  

At
any time after April 10, 2014, (the  Original Issue Date ) until the 2014 Debentures are no longer outstanding, the
2014 Debentures are convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of Common Stock at the option of the 2014 Debenture holders,
subject to certain conversion limitations set forth in the 2014 Debentures. The initial conversion price for the 2014 Debentures
is $0.25 per share, subject to adjustments upon certain events, as set forth in the 2014 Debentures. The Company will pay interest
on the aggregate unconverted and then outstanding principal amount of the 2014 Debentures at the rate of 8% per annum, payable
quarterly on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, beginning on October 1, 2014. The holders of the Company s convertible
debt agreed to postpone interest payments   (beginning with the July 1, 2015 payments) due on the convertible debt until
September 1, 2015. Interest is payable in cash or at the Company s option in shares of Common Stock, provided certain terms
and conditions are met as more fully described in the 2014 Debentures. On each of October 1, 2015 and January 1, 2016, the Company
is obligated to redeem an amount equal to $998,925 and on April 1, 2016, an amount equal to $1,997,850, plus accrued but unpaid
interest, liquidated damages and any other amounts then owing in respect of the 2014 Debentures (as to each of the forgoing periodic
redemptions, each a  Periodic Redemption Amount ). In lieu of a cash redemption and subject to the Company meeting
certain equity conditions described in the 2014 Debentures, the Company may elect to pay the Periodic Redemption Amount in shares
on the terms set forth in the 2014 Debentures.

       Convertible
    Debentures  (continued)     

Upon
any Event of Default (as defined in the 2014 Debentures), the outstanding principal amount of the 2014 Debentures, plus liquidated
damages, interest, a premium of 30% and other amounts owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration, shall become,
at the debenture holders  election, immediately due and payable in cash. Commencing five days after the occurrence of any
Event of Default, the interest rate on the 2014 Debentures shall accrue at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 18% per annum
or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. The 2014 Debentures contain anti-dilution protective provisions as described
therein. The Company is subject to compliance with certain covenants under the 2014 Debentures as set forth therein. On September
11, 2015, the Company failed to make a payment of interest that was due and payable on the 2014 Debentures and thus the outstanding
principal amount increased by $1,247,310 to $5,405,010.  

The
2014 Warrants may be exercised at any time on or after April 10, 2014 and on or prior to the close of business on April 10, 2019,
at an exercise price of $0.275 per share, subject to adjustment upon certain events. The 2014 Warrants contain anti-dilution protective
provisions and limitations on exercise as described therein.  

To
secure the Company s obligations under the 2014 Debentures, SG Building entered into a Subsidiary Guarantee, dated as of
April 10, 2014 (the  Guarantee ), pursuant to which it unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the prompt and complete
payment and performance when due of the obligations arising from the 2014 Debentures. The Company and SG Building have each granted
the debenture holders a security interest in their assets to secure the payment, performance and discharge in full of all of the
Company s obligations under the 2014 Debentures and the guarantor s obligations under the Guarantee, in accordance
with that certain Security Agreement, dated as of April 10, 2014.On August 5, 2015, the Company issued and sold to Hillair a $162,000
Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture due November 3, 2015 (the  Bridge Debenture ), for $150,000
(the  August 2015 Financing ). The sale and issuance of the Bridge Debenture was consummated pursuant to a Securities
Purchase Agreement, dated August 5, 2015, between the Company and Hillair. At any time after August 5, 2015, until the Bridge
Debenture is no longer outstanding, the Bridge Debenture is convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of Common Stock at the
option of Hillair, subject to certain conversion limitations set forth in the Bridge Debenture. The initial conversion price for
the Bridge Debenture is $0.10 per share, subject to adjustments upon certain events, as set forth in the Bridge Debenture. As
the Bridge Debenture was issued at an original issue discount, interest does not accrue on the Bridge Debenture.  

Due
to the Company filing a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Court, interest stopped accruing
on October 15, 2015. Additional contractual interest through June 30, 2016 would have resulted in $146,509 of additional interest.
On June 30, 2016, in connection with the Plan, all of the outstanding debentures were converted into preferred stock in accordance
with the Plan as disclosed in Note 1.  

Successor
Company     

On
the Effective Date, and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, SGB entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated June 30, 2016,
(the  2016 SPA ), pursuant to which SGB sold for a subscription price of $2,000,000, a 12% Original Issue Discount
Senior Secured Convertible Debenture to HCI in the principal amount of $2,500,000, with a maturity date of June 30, 2018 (the
 2016 Debenture ). The 2016 Debenture is convertible at HCI s option at any time in whole or in part into shares
of New Common Stock (as defined below) at a ratio of 1 share for every $1.25 of debt. Pursuant to that certain Subsidiary Guaranty
Agreement, effective as of the Effective Date (the  Guarantee Agreement ), by SG Building in favor of HCI, SG Building
unconditionally guaranteed (the  Guarantee ) the obligations and indebtedness owed to HCI under the 2016 Debenture
and the Guarantee is secured by a first-priority lien and security interest on all of the Guarantor s assets. The 2016 Debenture
and SG Building s obligations under the Guarantee are secured by a first-priority lien and security interest on all of the
Company s and SG Building s assets pursuant to that certain Security Agreement, dated as of the Effective Date, by
and between the Company, SG Building and HCI (the  Security Agreement ). At the date of issuance the fair value of
the conversion option liability was determined to be $394,460, which has been recorded as a discount to the debenture. As of September
30, 2015 the fair value of the conversion option liability was determined to be $376,115. HCI is a related party as disclosed
in Note 10.

7.   
       Net
    Income (Loss) Per Share     

Basic
net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) for the
period by the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially
dilutive common shares consist of the common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants. Potentially dilutive
common shares are excluded from the calculation if their effect is antidilutive. Diluted income per share includes the dilution
that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities into common stock using the  treasury
stock  and/or  if converted  method as applicable. At September 30, 2016 the Company also has outstanding convertible
debt which is initially convertible into 2,000,000 shares of common stock that could potentially dilute future net income (loss)
per share. The number of shares the convertible debt could be converted into could potentially increase under certain circumstances
related to the market price of the Company s common stock at the time of conversion. At September 30, 2015, there were options
and warrants to purchase 15,425,001 and 25,572,059 shares of common stock, respectively, outstanding. At September 30, 2015 the
Company also had outstanding convertible debt which was initially convertible into 15,982,800 shares of common stock.

lease on a straight line basis. Subsequent to March 31, 2015, the Company entered into a month-to-month lease for office space.
The rental expense charged to operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015 amounted to $13,200. The rental expense

       Related
    Party Transactions    

On
March 26, 2009, the Company entered into a $50,000 revolving credit promissory note (the  Revolver ) with Vector Group
Ltd. ( Vector ), the former controlling stockholder of the Company. On January 26, 2011, the Company and Vector entered
into an amendment to the Revolver increasing the amount that the Company may borrow from $50,000 to $100,000. The loan bears interest
at 11% per annum and was due on December 31, 2013. During January 2014, the Revolver was extended from December 31, 2013 to June
30, 2015. The Revolver is currently in default but the Company has obtained waivers from the Convertible Debenture holders in
regards to a cross default provision outlined in the underlying agreements. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance
due to Vector amounted to $73,500. In connection with the Plan the total amount including accrued interest due to Vector was adjusted
to $100,000. Due to the Company filing a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Court, interest
stopped accruing on October 15, 2015. Additional contractual interest through June 30, 2016 would have resulted in $3,773 of additional
interest. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, in connection with the Plan, the Revolver was treated as an unsecured claim and the Company
paid $75,000 in accordance with the Plan. As of September 30, 2016, the balance due to Vector amounted to $25,000. Interest expense
for other related party notes payable amounted to $2,066 and $6,131 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015,
respectively.

Bankruptcy
Proceedings    

On
October 15, 2015, SG Blocks, Inc. ( SGB ) and its subsidiaries SG Building and Endaxi Infrastructure Group, Inc. (each
a  Subsidiary,  together, the  Subsidiaries  and together with SGB, the  Debtors ), filed
voluntary petitions (the  Bankruptcy Petitions ) for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the  Bankruptcy
Court ). The Debtors filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking joint administration of their Chapter 11 cases under
the caption In re SG Blocks, Inc. et al. , Case No. 15-12790 (such proceeding, the  Bankruptcy Proceeding ). After
filing such voluntary petitions, the Debtors operated their businesses as  debtors-in-possession  under jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court
until the Effective Date (as defined below). On February 29, 2016, the Debtors filed a Disclosure Statement (the  Disclosure
Statement ), attaching a Plan of Reorganization (the  Plan ), along with a motion seeking approval of the Disclosure
Statement by the Bankruptcy Court. On June 30, 2016 (the  Effective Date ), the Plan became effective and the Debtors
emerged from bankruptcy.  

On
October 15, 2015, SGB, as borrower, and its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a Debtor in Possession Credit Agreement
(the  DIP Credit Agreement  and the loans thereunder, the  DIP Loan ) with Hillair Capital Investments
L.P. ( HCI ), and, as condition to making the DIP Loan, SGB and its subsidiaries entered into that Senior Security
Agreement (the  DIP Security Agreement  and together with the DIP Credit Agreement and the other documents entered
into in connection therewith, the  DIP Facility ), also dated as of October 15, 2015, with Hillair Capital Management
LLC ( HCM ) pursuant to which SGB and its subsidiaries granted HCM a first priority security interest in all of their
respective assets for the benefit of HCI. The DIP Loan had a maximum principal amount of $600,000, bore interest at a rate of
12% and was due and payable upon the earlier to occur of April 15, 2016 or other dates specified in the DIP Credit Agreement,
and required SGB to pay a collateral fee of $25,000. The funds advanced under the DIP Facility were used by SGB to fund its operation
during the Bankruptcy Proceeding, including payment of professional fees and expenses. On the Effective Date and in accordance
with the Plan, the DIP Facility was repaid in full and the related DIP Credit Agreement was terminated.  

On
the Effective Date, and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, SGB entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated June 30, 2016,
(the  2016 SPA ), pursuant to which SGB sold for a subscription price of $2.0 million a 12% Original Issue Discount
Senior Secured Convertible Debenture to HCI in the principal amount of $2.5 million, with a maturity date of June 30, 2018 (the
 Exit Facility ). The Exit Facility is convertible at HCI s option at any time in whole or in part into shares
of New Common Stock (as defined below) at a ratio of 1 share for every $1.25 of debt. Pursuant to that certain Subsidiary Guaranty
Agreement, effective as of the Effective Date (the  Guarantee Agreement ), by SG Building in favor of HCI, SG Building
unconditionally guaranteed (the  Guarantee ) the obligations and indebtedness owed to HCI under the Exit Facility
and the Guarantee is secured by a first-priority lien and security interest on all of the Guarantor s assets. The Exit Facility
and SG Building s obligations under the Guarantee are secured by a first-priority lien and security interest on all of the
Company s and SG Building s assets pursuant to that certain Security Agreement, dated as of the Effective Date, by
and between the Company, SG Building and HCI (the  Security Agreement ). The Exit Facility will be used (i) to make
a one hundred percent (100%) distribution for payment of unsecured claims in accordance with the Plan, (ii) to pay all costs of
the administration of SGB s Bankruptcy, (iii) to pay all amounts owed under the DIP Facility and (iv) for general working
capital purposes of SGB. As of September 30, 2016, in accordance with the Plan, 75% of the unsecured claims have been paid as
well as amount owed under the DIP Facility.  

Prior
to the Effective Date, SGB was authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (the  Former Common
Stock ) of which approximately 42,918,927 shares were issued and outstanding as of June 29, 2016. On the Effective Date,
all previously issued and outstanding shares of the Former Common Stock were deemed discharged, cancelled and extinguished, and,
pursuant to the Plan, SGB issued, in the aggregate, 491,357 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (the  New Common Stock ),
to the holders of Former Common Stock, representing 7.5% of SGB s issued and outstanding New Common Stock, after taking
into account full exercise of the Management Options (as defined below) and conversion of the New Preferred Stock (as defined
below) but prior to any conversion of the Exit Facility, as of the Effective Date. Further, under the Plan, upon the Effective
Date certain members of SGB s management were entitled to receive options ( Management Options ) to acquire
an aggregate of 10%, or approximately 655,153 shares, of SGB s New Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis, assuming conversion
of all of the New Preferred Stock but not the Exit Facility. On October 26, 2016, SGB has authorized the Management Options to
be issued.  

Prior
to the Effective Date, SGB was authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 (the  Former Preferred
Stock ) none of which was issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date. On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms
of the Plan and SGB s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, SGB filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware a Certificate of Designations of Convertible Preferred Stock, designating 5,405,010 shares of preferred stock, par
value $1.00 (the  New Preferred Stock ). As described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on July 7, 2016 (as amended, the  July 8-K ), on the
Effective Date and pursuant to the Plan, each Prepetition Loan Document (as defined in the July 8-K) was cancelled and the holders
of debt thereunder received one share of the New Preferred Stock for each dollar owed by SGB thereunder. The New Preferred Stock
is convertible into New Common Stock on a 1:1 basis and, if converted on the Effective Date, would convert into 82.5% of the New
Common Stock issued and outstanding on the Effective Date, after taking into account shares of New Common Stock issued to holders
of the Former Common Stock and the exercise of the Management Options but prior to any conversion of the Exit Facility. As of
September 30, 2016, the potential amount has not changed. On the Effective Date, HCI received 5,405,010 shares of the Company s
preferred stock which is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock. Since each share of the Company s
preferred stock is able to vote on an as converted basis HCI effectively has a controlling interest in the Company of 51.17% on
an as converted basis. As of September 30, 2016, the potential controlling interest percentage has not changed.  

Also
as described in the July 8-K, all general unsecured claims shall receive a distribution of one hundred percent of its allowed
claim, plus post-petition interest calculated at the Federal judgment rate, payable as follows: fifty percent on the Effective
Date, twenty five percent at the conclusion of the next full fiscal quarter after the Effective Date and the remaining twenty

As of September 30, 2016, twenty five percent of the general unsecured claims are due.

Results
of Operations    

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

Revenue    

Revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,371,933 compared to $2,160,455 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
This decrease of $788,522 resulted mainly from a decrease of revenue from block  green steel  jobs. Revenue recognized
from block  green steel  jobs decreased by $852,344 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue from block  green steel  jobs decreased primarily due to a decrease in the
number of jobs being completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2015.  

Cost
of Revenue and Gross Profit    

Cost
of revenue decreased by $590,554 to $1,117,917 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,708,471 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of revenue resulted primarily from a decrease of costs from block  green
steel  jobs. Costs recognized from block  green steel  jobs decreased $647,788 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit decreased to $254,016 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $451,984 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit percentage decreased to 19% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 21% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Payroll
and Related Expense    

Payroll
and related expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $522,709 compared to $813,544 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. This decrease resulted from a decrease in salaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was caused by a decrease in head count as well as reduction in salaries.  

Other
Operating Expenses    

Other
operating expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $881,842 compared to $718,820 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. This increase was mainly caused by an increase in pre-project expenses as well as amortization of intangible assets.  

Interest
Expense    

Interest expense for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 was $552,429 compared to $1,820,419 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This change resulted
primarily from the recognition of a default penalty of $1,247,310 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Other
income (expense)    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, there was other income (expense) recognized due to a change in fair value of financial

Revenue    

Revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $315,710 compared to $289,581 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
This increase of $26,129 resulted mainly from an increase of revenue from engineering services. Revenue recognized from engineering
services increased by $57,341 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Revenue from engineering services increased primarily due to an increase in the number of jobs being completed during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Cost
of Revenue and Gross Profit

and related expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $155,455 compared to $222,166 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. This decrease resulted from a decrease in salaries for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was caused by a decrease in head count as well as reduction in salaries.  

Other
Operating Expenses    

Other
operating expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $275,633 compared to $170,892 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. This increase was mainly caused by an increase in pre-project expenses as well as amortization of intangible assets.  

Interest
Expense    

Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $123,412 compared to $1,442,342 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. This change resulted primarily from a default penalty of $1,247,310 being recognized during the three months ended September
30, 2015.  

Other
income (expense)    

During
the three months ended September 30, 2015, there was other income (expense) recognized due to a change in fair value of financial
instruments of $131,289. There was $18,345 recognized as a result of a change in fair value of financial instruments during the
three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Income
Tax Provision    

A
100% valuation allowance was provided against the deferred tax asset consisting of available net operating loss carry forwards
and accordingly no income tax benefit was provided.  

Impact
of Inflation    

The
impact of inflation upon the Company s revenue and income (loss) from continuing operations during each of the past two
fiscal years has not been material to its financial position or results of operations for those years because the Company does
not maintain any inventories whose costs are affected by inflation.   

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Since
SG Building s inception in 2008, SG Building has generated losses from operations and the Company anticipates that it will
continue to generate losses from operations for the foreseeable future. The Company s net loss before reorganization items
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,684,608. Net cash used in operating activities was $1,393,781 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of $346,417.  

The
Company expects that through the next eighteen months, the capital requirements to fund the Company s growth will consume
all of the cash flows that it expects to generate from its operations, as well as any proceeds of any other issuances of senior
convertible debt securities. The Company further believes that during this period, while it is focusing on the growth and expansion
of its business, the gross profit that it expects to generate from operations will not generate sufficient funds to cover expected
operating costs. Accordingly, the Company requires further external funding to sustain operations and to follow through on the
execution of its business plan. However, there can be no assurance that the Company s plans will materialize, or that
the Company will be successful in funding estimated cash shortfalls through additional debt or equity capital and through the
cash generated by the Company s operations. Given these conditions, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
is contingent upon it being able to secure an adequate amount of debt or equity capital to enable it to meet its cash requirements.
In addition, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the obstacles, expenses
and complications frequently encountered by entrants into established markets, the competitive environment in which the Company
operates and the current capital raising environment.  

Since
inception, the Company s operations have primarily been funded through proceeds from equity and debt financings and
sales activity. Although management believes that the Company has access to capital resources, there are currently no commitments
in place for new financing at this time, and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain funds on commercially
acceptable terms, if at all.  

On
April 10, 2014, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with certain of the holders
of its existing Senior Convertible Debentures (the  Existing Debentures ).  Under the terms of the Exchange Agreement,
Existing Debentures with a stated maturity value of $1,680,000 were surrendered in exchange for (a) new Senior Convertible Debentures
with a stated interest rate of eight percent (8%) per year, a stated maturity value of $1,915,200, a conversion price of $0.25
per share, subject to adjustment, with a final maturity date of April 1, 2016 (the  2014 Exchange Debentures ), and
(b) five (5) year warrants to purchase up to 7,660,830 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $.275
per share (110% of the conversion price), subject to adjustment (the  2014 Exchange Warrants ).  Existing Debentures
with a maturity value of $392,000 were paid in accordance with the original terms.  

On
April 10, 2014, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  2014 SPA ) pursuant to which it issued
and sold (a) $2,080,500 (maturity value) in Senior Convertible Debentures for a subscription amount of $1,825,000, which had the
same terms as the 2014 Exchange Debentures, including a stated interest rate of eight percent (8%) per year and a conversion price
of $0.25 per share, subject to adjustment, with a final maturity date of April 1, 2016 (the  2014 New Debentures 
together with the 2014 Exchange Debentures, the  2014 Debentures ) and (b) five (5) year warrants to purchase up to
8,322,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.275 per share (110% of the conversion price),
subject to adjustment (the  2014 New Warrants  together with the 2014 Exchange Warrants, the  2014 Warrants ). 
Holders of the 2014 Debentures are referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the  2014 Holders .  

On
August 5, 2015, the Company issued and sold to Hillair a $162,000 Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture
due November 3, 2015 (the  Bridge Debenture ), for $150,000 (the  August 2015 Financing ). The sale and
issuance of the Bridge Debenture was consummated pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated August 5, 2015, between the
Company and Hillair.  

As
described in the July 8-K, the Existing Debentures, the 2014 Debentures, the Bridge Debenture and each other Prepetition Loan
Document (as defined in the July 8-K), were cancelled and the holders of debt thereunder received one share of the New Preferred
Stock for each dollar owed by SGB thereunder. See Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations   Bankruptcy Proceedings for additional detail regarding the conversion of debentures.  

On
September 11, 2015, the Company failed to make a payment of interest that was due and payable on its outstanding debentures, which,
as a result, caused the Company to be in default under the debentures.  As a result of these defaults, the debenture
holders had the right to demand repayment of the full outstanding amount, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of the debentures.
The default caused the principal balance of its outstanding debentures to increase 130%.  

On
October 15, 2015, concurrent with filing the Bankruptcy Petitions, SGB, as borrower, and its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered
into the DIP Credit Agreement with HCI, and, as condition to the making of the DIP Loan, SGB and its subsidiaries entered into
the DIP Security Agreement, also dated as of October 15, 2015, with HCM pursuant to which SGB and its subsidiaries granted HCM
a first priority security interest in all of their respective assets for the benefit of HCI. The DIP Loan had a maximum principal
amount of $600,000, bore interest at a rate of 12% and was due and payable upon the earlier to occur of April 15, 2016 or other
dates specified in the DIP Credit Agreement, and required SGB to pay a collateral fee of $25,000. The DIP Loan became due on April
15, 2016 but was not repaid until the Effective Date as described below. The funds advanced under the DIP Facility were used by
SGB to fund its operation during the Bankruptcy Proceeding, including payment of professional fees and expenses. On the Effective
Date and in accordance with the Plan, the DIP Facility was repaid in full and the related DIP Credit Agreement was terminated.  

On
the Effective Date, and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, SGB entered into the 2016 SPA, pursuant to which SGB sold for a subscription
price of $2.0 million a 12% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture to HCI in the principal amount of $2.5
million, with a maturity date of June 30, 2018 (the  Exit Facility ). As described below, the Exit Facility is convertible
at HCI s option at any time in whole or in part into shares of Common Stock at a ratio of 1 share for every $1.25 of debt.
The Exit Facility will be used (i) to make a one hundred percent (100%) distribution for payment of unsecured claims in accordance
with the Plan, (ii) to pay all costs of the administration of SGB s Bankruptcy, (iii) to pay all amounts owed under the
DIP Facility and (iv) for general working capital purposes of SGB. As of September 30, 2016, in accordance with the Plan, 75%
of the unsecured claims have been paid as well as amount owed under the DIP Facility.  

On
the Effective Date, all Former Common Stock were deemed discharged, cancelled and extinguished, and, pursuant to our Plan, SGB
issued, in the aggregate, 491,357 shares of New Common Stock to the holders of Former Common Stock, representing 7.5% of SGB s
issued and outstanding New Common Stock, after taking into account full exercise of the Management Options and conversion of the
New Preferred Stock but prior to any conversion of the Exit Facility, as of the Effective Date. Under the Plan, upon the Effective
Date certain members of SGB s management were entitled to receive the Management Options to acquire an aggregate of 10%,
or approximately 655,153 shares, of New Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis, assuming conversion of all of the Preferred Stock
but not the Exit Facility. The Preferred Stock is convertible into New Common Stock on a 1:1 basis and, if converted on the Effective
Date, would convert into 82.5% of the New Common Stock issued and outstanding on the Effective Date, after taking into account
shares of New Common Stock issued to holders of the Former Common Stock and the exercise of the Management Options but prior to
any conversion of the Exit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, the potential amount has not changed. The Exit Facility, in principal
amount of $2.5 million, is convertible at HCI s option at any time in whole or in part into shares of New Common Stock at
a ratio of 1 share for every $1.25 of debt. Conversion of the full principal amount of the Exit Facility ($2.5 million) would
result in the issuance of an additional 2,000,000 shares of New Common Stock, which will dilute the percentage ownership of then-existing
stockholders.  

Also
as described in the July 8-K, all general unsecured claims shall receive a distribution of one hundred percent of its allowed
claim, plus post-petition interest calculated at the Federal judgment rate, payable as follows: fifty percent on the Effective
Date, twenty five percent at the conclusion of the next full fiscal quarter after the Effective Date and the remaining twenty
five percent, plus any post-petition interest owed, at the conclusion of the second full fiscal quarter after the Effective Date.
As of September 30, 2016, twenty five percent of the general unsecured claims are due.  

The
Company intends to raise additional funds in the future through a private placement of its senior convertible debentures. The
additional capital would be used to fund the Company s operations, including the costs that it expects to incur as a public
company. The current level of cash and operating margins is not enough to cover the existing fixed and variable obligations of
the Company, so increased revenue performance and the addition of capital through issuances of securities are critical to
the Company s success. Assuming that the Company is successful in its growth plans and development efforts, the Company
believes that it will be able to raise additional funds through sales of its stock. There is no guarantee that the Company will
be able to raise such additional funds on acceptable terms, if at all.  

These
factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company s financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should it be unable to continue as a going
concern.   

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases
to which SG Building is a party.  

In
the ordinary course of business, SG Building enters into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions
which, in its judgment, are normal and customary for companies in its industry sector. These agreements are typically with consultants
and vendors. Pursuant to these agreements, SG Building generally agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the other parties
for losses suffered or incurred by such parties with respect to actions taken or omitted by SG Building. The maximum potential
amount of future payments SG Building could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. SG Building
has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result,
the estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded
for these provisions as of September 30, 2016.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements    

Critical
Accounting Policies    

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
( GAAP ), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and
assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Actual results
may differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates
are used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. A discussion of such critical accounting policies,
which include share-based payments, derivative instruments, and revenue recognition can be found in our Annual Report on Form
10-K, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes to the policies noted above as of
the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016 besides the following.  

Goodwill
    Goodwill represents the excess of reorganization value over fair-value of identified net assets upon emergence
from bankruptcy. In accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill, the Company performs its impairment test of goodwill
at the reporting unit level each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying values.  

Intangible
assets     Intangible assets represent the preliminary assets identified upon emergence from bankruptcy and consist
of $2,766,000 of proprietary knowledge and technology which is being amortized over 20 years and $1,113,000 of customer contracts
which is being amortized over 2.5 years. The accumulated amortization and amortization expense as of and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $34,575 and $111,300, respectively.   

Related
Party Transactions    

On
March 26, 2009, the Company entered into a $50,000 revolving credit promissory note (the  Revolver ) with Vector Group
Ltd. ( Vector ), the former controlling stockholder of the Company. On January 26, 2011, the Company and Vector entered
into an amendment to the Revolver increasing the amount that the Company may borrow from $50,000 to $100,000. The loan bears interest
at 11% per annum and was due on December 31, 2013. During January 2014, the Revolver was extended from December 31, 2013 to June
30, 2015. The Revolver is currently in default but the Company has obtained waivers from the Convertible Debenture holders in
regards to a cross default provision outlined in the underlying agreements. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance
due to Vector amounted to $73,500. In connection with the Plan the total amount including accrued interest due to Vector was adjusted
to $100,000. Due to the Company filing a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Court, interest
stopped accruing on October 15, 2015. Additional contractual interest through June 30, 2016 would have resulted in $3,773 of additional
interest. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, in connection with the Plan, the Revolver was treated as an unsecured claim and the Company
paid $75,000 in accordance with the Plan. Interest expense for other related party notes payable amounted to $2,066 and $6,131
for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.      

ConGlobal
Industries, Inc. is a minority stockholder of the Company and provides containers and labor on domestic projects. The Company
recognized Cost of Goods Sold of $209,867 and $235,373, for services ConGlobal Industries, Inc. rendered during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The Company recognized Cost of Goods Sold of $419,095 and $759,598, for services
ConGlobal Industries, Inc. rendered during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. As of September 30,
2016, $79,367 of such expenses are included in related party accounts payable and accrued expenses   subject to compromise
in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $38,950 and $317,468,
respectively, of such expenses are included in related party accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheets.  

The
Lawrence Group is a minority stockholder of the Company and is a building design, development and project delivery firm. As of
September 30, 2016, $13,171 of such expenses are included in related party accounts payable and accrued expenses   subject
to compromise in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015, $52,683 of expenses was included
in related party accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

The
Company has accrued certain reimbursable expenses of owners of the Company. Such expenses amounted to $6,868 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and are included in related party accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheets.  

An
affiliated accounting firm of the Company s former Chief Financial Officer provided accounting and consulting services to
the Company. The Company recognized General and Administrative expenses in the amount of $30,250 and $72,250, respectively, for
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Item
    4.   
       Controls
    and Procedures    

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures.    

Management,
with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ) Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the  Evaluation
Date ). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of
the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Notwithstanding
the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer believe that the condensed consolidated financial
statements and other information contained in this Quarterly Report present fairly, in all material respects, our business, financial
condition and results of operations.  

Our
management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further,
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  

In
connection with the audit of our fiscal 2015 consolidated financial statements, our independent auditors identified certain significant
deficiencies that together constitute a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures. These significant deficiencies
primarily relate to our (i) difficulty in generating data in a form and format that facilitates the timely analysis of information
needed to produce accurate financial reports, (ii) difficulty in applying complex accounting and financial reporting and disclosure
rules required under GAAP and the SEC reporting regulations, and (iii) limited segregation of duties.  These significant
deficiencies together constitute a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures.  

We
have taken certain steps in an effort to correct these material weaknesses, including retaining the Chief Financial Officer who
has significant experience with publicly-held companies.  Although this is an important step towards improving the application
of complex accounting principles, the preparation of financial reports and the segregation of duties, additional time is still
required to fully implement additional internal controls procedures and test their operating effectiveness before we can definitively
conclude that we have remediated our deficiencies.  Because these remediation steps have not yet been completed, we
have performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements contained in this
Quarterly Report were prepared in accordance with GAAP and applicable SEC regulations.  

We
believe that our weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls relate in part to the fact
that SG Building is a relatively small company with few employees.  Our internal controls are still in a state of transition
as we work diligently to integrate and assimilate all of our operations and work to remedy the significant deficiencies that together
constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

Notwithstanding
our remedial actions and integration of our financial reporting systems, there was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the first quarter of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

the outstanding principal amount increased by $1,247,310 to $5,405,010. Subsequent to September 30, 2015, all of the outstanding
debentures were converted into preferred stock in accordance with the Plan as disclosed Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Bankruptcy Proceedings.
