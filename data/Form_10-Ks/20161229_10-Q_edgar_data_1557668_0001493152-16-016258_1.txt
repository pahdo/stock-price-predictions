Note
1  Nature and Continuance of Operations   

Wishbone
Pet Products Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 30, 2009. The Company has been in the development stage since
its formation and has not realized any revenues from its planned operations. The Company is primarily engaged in the business
of developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling dog waste removal devices.  

The
Company has chosen an April 30 fiscal year end.  

Note
2  Basis of Presentation   Going Concern Uncertainties   

These
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which
contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company is at its early stages of development and has limited
operations, and has sustained operating losses resulting in a deficit.  

The
Company has accumulated a deficit of $154,244 since inception, has yet to achieve profitable operations and further losses are
anticipated in the development of its business. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt
and is dependent upon obtaining financing and/or achieving a sustainable profitable level of operations. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company may seek additional equity
as necessary and it expects to raise funds through private or public equity investment or loans from directors of the Company
in order to support existing operations. There is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for the Company on
acceptable terms, if at all.  

Note
3  Interim Reporting and Significant Accounting Policies   

The
interim financial statements are prepared under the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim information. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include
all of the information and note required by GAAP for complete financial statements. While the information presented is unaudited,
it includes all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, result
of operation and cash flows for the interim periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. It is suggested that the interim financial statements
be read in conjunction with the Company s April 30, 2016 annual financial statements. Operating results for the six month
period ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the year ended April 30,
2017.  

There
have been no changes in the accounting policies from those disclosed in the notes to the audited condensed financial statements
for the year ended April 30, 2016.  

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements   

The
Company adopts new pronouncements relating to generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Company as they are issued,
which may be in advance of their effective date. Management does not believe that any pronouncement not yet effective but recently
issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA or the SEC would, if adopted, have a material effect
on the accompanying financial statements  

Note
4  Notes Payable   

The
Company entered into 8 notes payable. They are all due within 30 days following written demand and bears a monthly
interest rate of 1% (12% per annum).  

Note
5  Common Shares   

During
the year ended April 30, 2016, the Company issued 250,000 common shares to investors valued at $0.02 per share.  

Note
6  Subsequent events   

The
Company evaluated all events or transaction that occurred after October 31, 2016 up through date the Company issued these
financial statements and found no subsequent events that needed to be reported.  

FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS    

Statements
made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are  forward-looking statements  made pursuant to
the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Act ) and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as  may,   will, 
 expect,   believe,   anticipate,   estimate,   approximate  or  continue, 
or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We
wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.
Any forward-looking statements represent management s best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking
statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events
to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim
any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such
statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.  

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION    

GENERAL  

Wishbone
Pet Products Inc.  was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on July 30, 2009. Our registration statement
on Form S-1 was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission was declared effective on February 14, 2013. We have filed post-effective
amendments to this registration statement, on September 4, 2015 the Securities   Exchange Commission declared the
amendments effective.  

We
intend to commence business operations by developing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling dog waste removal devices. We are
currently considered a development stage company. To date, our president, Rami Tabet, has developed a device concept that permits
the user to enclose dog waste in a plastic bag this is contained inside of a sealed plastic case. The user can then disposed of
the plastic bag without direct contact. To date, we have not manufactured or sold any dog waste removal devices. We are considered
to be a  shell company , which is a company with either no or nominal operations or assets, or assets consisting solely
of cash and cash equivalents. An investment in the shares of a shell company should be considered highly illiquid given the resale
restrictions that apply to them. In order to continue our business plan, we need to transform our device concept into a working
prototype that is suitable for mass production and then enter into an agreement with a suitable third party for manufacture. We
then intend to initially distribute our products in North America with a view to expanding our market focus depending on our initial
success.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be
unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We
expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.  

Three-Month
Period Ended October 31, 2016 Compared to the Three-Month Period Ended October 31, 2015.   

Our
net loss for the three-month period ended October 31, 2016 was $7,528 (2015: $7,048), which consisted of professional fees of
$2,975 (2015: $2,615), general and administration expenses of $2,065 (2015: $2,693), and interest on loans of $2,488 (2015: $1,740).
We did not generate any revenue during either three-month period in fiscal 2016 or 2015. The slightly higher loss in the current
fiscal year primarily relate to an increase in accounting, audit, and interest expense.  

The
weighted average number of shares outstanding was 3,750,000 for the three-month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. As of
the date of this quarterly report, our issued and outstanding capital consists of 3,750,000 shares of common stock.  

Six-Month
Period Ended October 31, 2016 Compared to the Six-Month Period Ended October 31, 2015.   

Our
net loss for the six-month period ended October 31, 2016 was $13,634 (2015: $19,596), which consisted of professional fees of
$5,950 (2015: $7,550), general and administration expenses of $2,789 (2015: $8,749), and interest on loans of $4,895 (2015: $3,297).
We did not generate any revenue during either six-month period in fiscal 2016 or 2015. The lower expenses in the current fiscal
year primarily relate to a decrease in general expenses related to costs we incurred in obtaining DTC eligibility for our common
stock.  

The
weighted average number of shares outstanding was 3,750,000 for the six-month period ended October 31, 2016 and 3,697,011 for
the six-month period ended October 31, 2015.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

As
at October 31, 2016, our current assets were $609 compared to $635 at April 30, 2016. As at October 31, 2016, our current liabilities
were $132,853 compared to $119,245 at April 30, 2016. Current liabilities at October 31, 2016 were comprised of $88,086 in loans
payable and $44,767 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  

Stockholders 
deficit increased from $140,610 as of April 30, 2016 to $154,244 as of October 31, 2016.  

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities   

We
have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the six-month period ended October 31, 2016, net cash flows
used in operating activities were $7,887 consisting of a net loss of $13,634, which was offset by a $5,747 non-cash component
of accounts payable. For the six-month period ended October 31, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities were $10,349.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities   

We
have financed our operations primarily from either the issuance of our shares of common stock or from loans. During the six-month
period ended October 31, 2016, we received shareholder loans of $7,861. In the comparable period in 2015, we received $10,000
in proceeds as a shareholder loan.  

PLAN
OF OPERATION AND FUNDING   

We
expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances
of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.  

Existing
working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations
over the next three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations
to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management
anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii)
developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses
with further issuances of securities and director loans. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate
revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in
dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common
stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are
not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities,
which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next
twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such
funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock.
We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for additional
loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements
in place for any future equity financing.  

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS    

As
of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  

GOING
CONCERN   

The
independent auditors  report accompanying our April 30, 2016 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared  assuming
that we will continue as a going concern,  which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities
and commitments in the ordinary course of business.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.    

No
report required.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:   

We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))
as of October 31, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of October 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses
in internal control over financial reporting. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or
a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that, as of October
31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk
assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. 

Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting:   

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the six months ended October 31, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by
others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  

(b)
designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  

(c)
evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
such evaluation; and  

(d)
disclosed in this quarterly report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.  

5.
I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, to the registrant s
auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  

(a)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
and  

(b)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
internal control over financial reporting.
