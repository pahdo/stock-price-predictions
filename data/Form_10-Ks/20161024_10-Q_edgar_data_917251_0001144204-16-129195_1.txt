Note 1   Organization 

  Agree
Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust ( REIT ) primarily
focused on the ownership, acquisition, development and management of retail properties net leased to industry leading tenants.
We were founded in 1971 by our current Executive Chairman, Richard Agree, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE )
in 1994.  

Our
assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, directly or indirectly, Agree Limited Partnership (the  Operating
Partnership ), of which we are the sole general partner and in which we held a 98.6% interest as of September 30, 2016.
Under the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, we, as the sole general partner, have exclusive responsibility and
discretion in the management and control of the Operating Partnership.  

The
terms  Agree Realty,  the  Company,   we,   our  or  us  refer to
Agree Realty Corporation and all of its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership.  

Note 2   Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies 

    Basis
of Accounting and Principles of Consolidation    

  The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by GAAP for audited financial statements. The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in
the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period presented. Operating results
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December
31, 2016. Amounts as of December 31, 2015 included in the consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be
read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The
unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  

Use
of Estimates    

  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of (1) assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and (2) revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Reclassification    

  Certain
reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes in order to conform
to the current presentation. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-03, unamortized debt issuance cost is presented as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability; in previously filed reports the unamortized debt issuance cost was classified
on the Balance Sheet as an Unamortized Deferred Expense.  

Segment
Reporting    

  We
are primarily in the business of acquiring, developing and managing retail real estate which we consider one reporting
segment. The Company has no other reporting segments.  

Real Estate Investments   

 The Company records the acquisition of real
estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. For properties developed by the Company, all direct and indirect costs
related to planning, development and construction, including interest, real estate taxes and other miscellaneous costs incurred
during the construction period, are capitalized for financial reporting purposes and recorded as property under development until
construction has been completed. Properties classified as  held for sale  are recorded at the lower of their carrying
value or their fair value less anticipated selling costs.

Accounting for Acquisitions of Real
Estate   

 The acquisition of property for investment
purposes is typically accounted for as an asset acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price to land, buildings and identified
intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their relative estimated fair values and without giving rise to goodwill.
Intangible assets and liabilities represent the value of in-place leases and above- or below-market leases. In making estimates
of fair values, the Company may use a number of sources, including data provided by independent third parties, as well as information
obtained by the Company as a result of its due diligence, including expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics
of the markets where the property is located. 

In allocating the
fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, in-place lease intangibles are valued
based on the Company s estimate of costs related to tenant acquisition and the carrying costs that would be incurred during
the time it would take to locate a tenant if the property were vacant, considering current market conditions and costs to execute
similar leases at the time of the acquisition.   Above-and-below market lease intangibles are
recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the leases at the
time of acquisition of the real estate and management s estimate of current market lease rates for the property, measured
over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. 

The fair value of identified intangible assets
and liabilities acquired is amortized to depreciation and amortization over the remaining term of the related leases. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

 The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money
market accounts. The account balances periodically exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insurance
coverage, and as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.
We had $10.7 million and $1.7 million in cash as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, in excess of the FDIC
insured limit. 

Cash Held in Escrows   

 Escrows include amounts established pursuant
to various agreements for security deposits, property taxes, insurance and other costs. Escrows also include cash held by qualified
intermediaries for possible like-kind exchanges in accordance with Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code in connection with
the sales of the Company s properties. 

Accounts Receivable   Tenants   

 The Company reviews its rent receivables for
collectability on a regular basis, taking into consideration changes in factors such as the tenant s payment history, the
financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in
the area where the property is located. In the event that the collectability of a receivable with respect to any tenant is in
doubt, a provision for uncollectible amounts will be established or a direct write-off of the specific rent receivable will be
made. For accrued rental revenues related to the straight-line method of reporting rental revenue, the Company performs a periodic
review of receivable balances to assess the risk of uncollectible amounts and establish appropriate provisions. 

Sales Tax   

  The
Company collects various taxes from tenants and remits these amounts, on a net basis, to the applicable taxing authorities.

Unamortized Deferred Expenses   

 Deferred expenses include debt financing costs,
leasing costs and lease intangibles and are amortized as follows: (i) debt financing costs on a straight-line basis to interest
expense over the term of the related loan which approximates the Effective Interest Method; (ii) leasing costs on a straight-line
basis to depreciation and amortization over the term of the related lease entered into; and (iii) lease intangibles on a straight-line
basis to depreciation and amortization over the remaining term of the related lease acquired. 

The following schedule summarizes
the Company s amortization of deferred expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively (in thousands): 

The following schedule represents estimated
future amortization of deferred expenses as of September 30, 2016 (in thousands): 

Earnings per Share   

  Earnings
per share have been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings
per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average common and potential dilutive common shares outstanding in
accordance with the treasury stock method.  

The
following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net earnings per common share computation to the denominator of
the diluted net earnings per common share computation for each of the periods presented:  

Income Taxes   

 The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Internal Revenue Code ). As a REIT, the Company generally
will not be subject to federal income tax provided it continues to satisfy certain tests concerning the Company s sources
of income, the nature of its assets, the amounts distributed to its stockholders, and the ownership of Company stock. Management
believes the Company has qualified and will continue to qualify as a REIT. Notwithstanding the Company s qualification for
taxation as a REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and real estate. 

AGREE REALTY CORPORATION  

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  September 30, 2016  

  (Unaudited)  

The Company has established taxable REIT
subsidiaries ( TRS ) pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company s TRS entities are
able to engage in activities resulting in income that would be non-qualifying income for a REIT. As a result, certain activities
of the Company which occur within its TRS entities are subject to federal and state income taxes. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued a deferred income tax amount of $705,000. In addition, the Company recognized no income
tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $7,747 and $25,100 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Fair
Values of Financial Instruments    

 The Company s estimates of the fair
value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting
guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability
in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs
that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following
describes the three levels: 

Level 1     Valuation is based upon quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2     Valuation is based upon inputs other than in Level
1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in
markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially
the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3     Valuation is generated from model-based techniques
that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include option pricing
models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force.  The objective of ASU No. 2016-15 is to provide specific guidance
on eight cash flow classification issues and how to reduce diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented
and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics.The amendments in this
update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within
those fiscal years. We are still in the process of determining the impact that the implementation of ASU 2016-15 will have on the
Company s financial statements. 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-13  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments.  The objective of ASU No. 2016-13 is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful
information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting
entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the current incurred impairment methodology in current GAAP is to be
replaced by a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and
supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. For public business entities that are U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ) filers, the amendments in the update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are still in the process of determining the impact that
the implementation of ASU 2016-13 will have on the Company s financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ), which amends ASC Topic 718, Stock
Compensation. ASU 2016-09 includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted
for and presented in the financial statements. ASU 2016-09 will allow entities to make an accounting policy election for the impact
of most types of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards by allowing the forfeitures to be either
estimated, as is currently required, or recognized when they actually occur. If elected, the change to recognize forfeitures when
they occur will be adopted using a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings.
ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal 2017, including interim periods in the year of adoption.
Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company has adopted ASU 2016-09 in the context of how the Company
accounts for stock forfeitures, which is reflected in the Company s financial statements. 

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-05  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations
on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships .  ASU 2016-05 addresses the impact on hedge accounting due to a change in
a counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument under Topic 815.  The amendments
in this update apply to all reporting entities for which there is a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that
has been designated as a hedging instrument under Topic 815.  The amendments in this update clarify that a change in the counterparty
to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require
dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria (including those in paragraphs 815-20-35-14
through 35-18) continue to be met.  For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  We have
reviewed ASU 2016-05 in the context of our hedge accounting and determined that it will have no impact upon adoption. 

In February 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-02  Leases.  The new standard creates Topic 842, Leases, in FASB  Accounting
Standards Codification  (FASB ASC) and supersedes FASB ASC 840,  Leases.  ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize
the assets and liabilities that arise from leases (operating and finance). However, for leases with a term of 12 months or
less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The
main difference between the existing guidance on accounting for leases and the new standard is that operating leases will now
be recorded in the statement of financial position as assets and liabilities. The new standard requires lessors to account
for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases and operating
leases. ASU 2016-02 is expected to impact the Company s consolidated financial statements as the Company has certain
operating land lease arrangements for which it is the lessee. Current GAAP requires only capital (finance) leases to be
recognized in the statement of financial position and amounts related to operating leases largely are reflected in
the financial statements as rent expense on the income statement and in disclosures to the financial statements. ASU No.
2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods within those periods) beginning after December
15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are still in the process of determining the impact that the implementation of ASU
2016-02 will have on the Company s financial statements. 

In April 2015, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued ASU No. 2015-03  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation
of Debt Issuance Costs.  The objective of ASU 2015-03 is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of GAAP for which cost
and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements.
To simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, the amendments require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability
be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments. ASU No. 2015-03 is effective
for annual reporting periods (including interim periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption
is permitted. The Company has adopted the new guidance and determined the resulting impact on the statements was a reclassification
of certain deferred financing costs from other assets to each respective balance sheet debt account.

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued ASU No. 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606). ASU No. 2014-09 was developed to
enable financial statement users to better understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from contracts with customers. The update s core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. Companies are to use a five-step contract review model to ensure revenue is recognized,
measured and disclosed in accordance with this principle. ASU 2014-09 was to be effective for fiscal years and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2015-14 to defer the
effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for one year. As a result, ASU No. 2014-09 is now effective for fiscal years and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2017. 

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-08  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations. 
In April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-10  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying
Performance Obligations and Licensing.  In May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2016-12  Revenue

change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The amendments only clarify the implementation guidance. We are still in

Investments   

 During the three
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased 14 retail net lease assets for approximately $49.5 million, including acquisition
and closing costs. These properties are located in 11 states and are leased to 13 different tenants operating in 11 diverse retail
sectors for a weighted average lease term of approximately 10.6 years. The underwritten weighted average capitalization rate on
the Company s acquisitions was approximately 8.0%. 

During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased 60 retail net lease assets for approximately $234.0 million, which includes
acquisition and closing costs. These properties are located in 23 states and are leased to 40 different tenants operating in 20
diverse retail sectors for a weighted average lease term of approximately 10.7 years. The underwritten weighted average capitalization
rate on the Company s acquisitions was approximately 7.8%. 

The aggregate acquisitions for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 were allocated $69.4 million to land, $132.6 million to buildings and improvements, and $32.0 million
to lease intangibles. The acquisitions were all cash purchases and there were no contingent considerations associated with these
acquisitions. 

None of the Company s acquisitions
during the first nine months of 2016 caused any new or existing tenant to comprise 10% or more of its total assets or generate
10% or more of its total annualized base rent at September 30, 2016. 

The Company calculates the underwritten
weighted average capitalization rate on its acquisitions by dividing annual expected net operating income derived from the properties
by the total investment in the properties. Annual expected net operating income is defined as the straight-line rent for the base
term of the lease less property level expenses (if any) that are not recoverable from the tenant. 

Dispositions   

  During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold two assets for net proceeds of $15.0 million; a Walgreens property
in Rancho Cordova, California and a Walgreens property in Macomb, Michigan. The Company recorded a net gain of approximately $4.4
million on the sales.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold three assets for net proceeds of $22.1 million, including the two assets
described above, in addition to the sale of a Walgreens in Port St. Johns, Florida. The Company recorded a net gain of approximately
$7.1 million on the sales.  

Note 4   Debt 

 In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03,
which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction
from the gross carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. We adopted ASU 2015-03 effective March 31,
2016, and appropriately applied the guidance retrospectively to our Mortgage Notes Payable, Unsecured Term Loans and Senior Unsecured
Notes for all periods presented. Unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately $2.8 million and $2.7 million are now included
as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively (previously included in Unamortized Deferred Expenses on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets). 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
total gross indebtedness of $437.8 million, including (i) $70.6 million of mortgage notes payable; (ii) $160.2 million of unsecured
term loans; (iii) $160.0 million of senior unsecured notes; and (iv) $47.0 million of borrowings under $150.0 million revolving
credit facility (the  Credit Facility ). 

Mortgage Notes Payable   

 As of September 30, 2016,
the Company had total gross mortgage indebtedness of $70.6 million which was collateralized by related real estate with an aggregate
net book value of $90.5 million. Including mortgages that have been swapped to a fixed interest rate, the weighted average interest
rate on the Company s mortgage notes payable was 4.83%.

Stock 

 On March 27, 2015, the SEC declared effective
a shelf registration statement previously filed by the Company. The securities covered by this registration statement, which expires
March 27, 2018, cannot exceed $500.0 million in the aggregate and include common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and
warrants. The Company may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when
and if these securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered,
will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. 

On May 6, 2015, the Company implemented
a $100.0 million at-the-market equity program ( ATM ) by entering into multiple equity distribution agreements through
which the Company may, from time to time, sell shares of common stock. The Company uses the proceeds generated from its ATM program
for general corporate purposes including funding our investment activity, the repayment or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness,
working capital and other general purposes. 

We completed a follow-on offering of 2,875,000
shares of common stock in May 2016. The offering, which included the full exercise of the overallotment option by the underwriters,
raised net proceeds of approximately $109.7 million after deducting the underwriting discount. The proceeds from the offering were
used to pay down amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company issued 246,565 shares of common stock under its ATM program at a weighted average price of $49.66, realizing
gross proceeds of approximately $12.2 million. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company issued 315,607 shares of common stock under its ATM program at a weighted average price of $47.21, realizing
gross proceeds of approximately $14.9 million. The Company has approximately $45.8 million remaining under the ATM program as of
September 30, 2016. 

Note 6   Dividends
and Distribution Payable 

 On September 6, 2016, the Company declared
a dividend of $0.48 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The holders of limited partnership interests in the Operating
Partnership ( OP Units ) were entitled to an equal distribution per OP Unit held as of September 30, 2016. The dividends
and distributions payable were recorded as liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016. The dividend
has been reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity and the distribution has been reflected as a reduction of the limited
partners' non-controlling interest. These amounts were paid on October 14, 2016. 

Note 7   Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activity 

 The Company is exposed to certain risks
arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety
of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risk, including
interest rate, liquidity and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and, to a
limited extent, through the use of derivative instruments. 

The Company s objective in using
interest rate derivatives is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements and add stability to interest expense. To accomplish
this objective, the Company uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps
designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making
fixed rate payments over the life of the agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. 

In April 2012, the Company
entered into an  amortizing forward starting interest rate swap agreement to hedge against changes in future cash flows
resulting from changes in interest rates on $22.3 million in variable-rate borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate
swap agreement, the Company receives from the counterparty interest on the notional amount based on 1 mo. LIBOR and pays to
the counterparty a fixed rate of 1.92%. This swap effectively converted $22.3 million of variable-rate borrowings to
fixed-rate borrowings from July 1, 2013 to May 1, 2019.

in variable-rate borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, the Company receives from the counterparty interest
on the notional amount based on 1 mo. LIBOR and pays to the counterparty a fixed rate of 0.89%. This swap effectively converted
$25.0 million of variable-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings from December 6, 2012 to April 4, 2018. 

In September 2013, the Company entered
into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on
$35.0 million in variable-rate borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, the Company receives from the counterparty
interest on the notional amount based on 1 mo. LIBOR and pays to the counterparty a fixed rate of 2.20%. This swap effectively
converted $35.0 million of variable-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings from October 3, 2013 to September 29, 2020. 

In July 2014, the Company entered into
interest rate swap agreements to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on $65.0 million
in variable-rate borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, the Company receives from the counterparty interest
on the notional amount based on 1 mo. LIBOR and pays to the counterparty a fixed rate of 2.09%. This swap effectively converted
$65.0 million of variable-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings from July 21, 2014 to July 21, 2021. 

In June 2016, the Company entered into
an interest rate swap agreement to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on $40.0
million in variable-rate borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, the Company receives from the counterparty
interest on the notional amount based on 1 mo. LIBOR and pays to the counterparty a fixed rate of 1.40%. This swap effectively converted
$40.0 million of variable-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings from August 1, 2016 to July 1, 2023. 

Companies are required to recognize all
derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet. The Company has designated these derivative
instruments as cash flow hedges. As such, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives designated and
that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). The ineffective portion of the
change in fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized directly in interest expense. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not recorded any hedge ineffectiveness in earnings. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s
variable-rate debt. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that an additional $2.0 million will be reclassified as
an increase to interest expense. 

The Company had the following outstanding
interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk (in thousands except number of instruments):

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features  

The Company has agreements with two of
its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations
if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the Company's default on the indebtedness. 

As of September 30, 2016, the fair value
of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk,
related to these agreements was $6.2 million. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not posted any collateral related to these.
If the Company had breached any of these provisions as of September 30, 2016, it could have been required to settle its obligations
under the agreements at their termination value of $6.2 million.

Fair Value Measurements 

  Assets and Liabilities Measured at
Fair Value  

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure  (ASC 820).   ASC 820 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  ASC
820 applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements;
accordingly, the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances.  

ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is
a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.  Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined
based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  As a basis for considering
market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs
that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant
assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). 

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other
than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2
inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for
the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable
at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on
an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of
the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy
within which the entire fair value measurement falls, is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement
in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

Derivative Financial Instruments

Currently, the Company uses interest rate
swap agreements to manage its interest rate   risk.     The valuation of these instruments is determined using
widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This
analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based
inputs, including interest rate curves.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  September 30, 2016  

  (Unaudited)  

To comply with the provisions of ASC 820,
the Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective
counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.  In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts
for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements,
such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. 

Although the Company has determined that
the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation
adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the
likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties.  However, as of September 30, 2016, the Company has assessed the
significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined
that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives.  As a result, the
Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The table below presents the Company s
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016, aggregated by the level in the fair
value hierarchy within which those measurements fall (in thousands):

Incentive Plan 

 The Company estimates the fair value of
restricted stock grants at the date of grant and amortizes those amounts into expense on a straight line basis or amount vested,
if greater, over the appropriate vesting period. 

As of September 30, 2016, there was $5.3
million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the outstanding restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized
over a weighted average period of 3.3 years. The Company used 0% for both the discount factor and forfeiture rate for determining
the fair value of restricted stock. 

The holder of a restricted stock award
is generally entitled at all times on and after the date of issuance of the restricted shares to exercise the rights of a stockholder
of the Company, including the right to vote the shares and the right to receive dividends on the shares.

Overview 

 The Company is a fully
integrated REIT primarily focused on the ownership, acquisition, development and management of retail properties net leased to
industry leading tenants. The Company was founded in 1971 by its current Executive Chairman, Richard Agree, and listed on the
New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) in 1994. The Company s assets are held by, and all of its operations are conducted
through, directly or indirectly, Agree Limited Partnership (the  Operating Partnership ), of which the Company is
the sole general partner and in which it held a 98.6% interest as of September 30, 2016. 

As of September 30,
2016, the Company s portfolio consisted of 341 properties located in 43 states and totaling approximately 6.7 million square
feet of gross leasable area. As of September 30, 2016, the portfolio was approximately 99.6% leased and had a weighted average
remaining lease term of approximately 10.8 years. Substantially all of the Company s tenants are subject to net lease agreements.
A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including
property taxes, insurance and maintenance. 

Third Quarter
2016 Highlights   

 During the three
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased 14 retail net lease assets for approximately $49.5 million, which includes
acquisition and closing costs. These properties are located in 11 states and are 100% leased to 13 different tenants operating
in 11 diverse retail sectors for a weighted average lease term of approximately 10.6 years. The underwritten weighted average
capitalization rate on the Company s third quarter 2016 acquisitions was approximately 8.0%. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold two assets for net proceeds of $15.0 million, a Walgreens
property in Rancho Cordova, California and a Walgreens property in Macomb, Michigan. The Company recorded a net gain of
approximately $4.4 million on the sales.  

During the three
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 246,565 shares of common stock under its at-the-market ( ATM )
program realizing gross proceeds of approximately $12.2 million. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $45.8
remaining under the ATM program. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

  Refer to Note 2 to the September
30, 2016, Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

 The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires the Company s
management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. Management bases
estimates on the best information available at the time, its experience, and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. If management s judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other
matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting principles would have been applied, resulting in a different
presentation of the interim consolidated financial statements. From time to time, the Company may re-evaluate its estimates and
assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent
periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of the Company s
critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The
Company has not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this quarterly report. 

Results of Operations  

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 to
Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

 Total rental income increased
$5.5 million, or 33%, to $22.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $16.8 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. Approximately $5.7 million of the increase was due to the acquisition of additional net lease properties
and approximately $0.3 million was due to the development of new net lease properties. These increases were partially offset by
a reduction in minimum rental income of approximately $0.5 million relating to properties that were sold. 

Operating cost reimbursements
increased $0.8 million, or 90%, to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.0 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. Operating cost reimbursements increased primarily due to higher levels of recoverable property
operating expenses, including real estate taxes, acquisition, disposition and development activity. The portfolio recovery rate
increased to 112% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 85% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due
to timing of property operating expenses and reimbursements. 

Other income remained
generally consistent with prior periods. 

Real estate taxes increased
$0.8 million, or 106%, to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.7 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due to the ownership of additional properties in the third quarter of 2016 compared
to the third quarter of 2015 for which we remit real estate taxes and are subsequently reimbursed by tenants. 

Property operating expenses
decreased by $0.2 million, or (60%), to $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.4 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to timing of property operating expenses. Our tenants
subsequently reimbursed us for the majority of these expenses. 

Land lease payments remained
generally consistent with prior periods. 

General and administrative
expenses increased $0.2 million, or 14%, to $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.8 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily the result of increased employee count and associated
professional costs. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 8.4% for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 from 9.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Depreciation and amortization
increased $1.2 million, or 23%, to $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5.0 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due to the ownership of additional properties for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to three months ended September 30, 2015. 

The Company recorded
no impairment charges during the third quarter of 2016. 

Interest expense increased
$0.6 million, or 17%, to $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.5 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense is primarily a result of the $40.0 million 2023 Term Loan issued in
July 2016 and the $60.0 million 2028 Senior Unsecured Notes issued in August 2016 which were offset by the repayment of the $8.6
million portfolio mortgage loan due 2016. 

The Company recognized
a net gain of $4.4 million during the third quarter of 2016, including a gain of $3.5 million on the sale of a Walgreens
in Rancho Cordova, California and a gain of $1.0 million on the sale of a Walgreens in Macomb, Michigan. The Company also
recorded additional costs of approximately $0.1 million associated with a property sold in the second quarter of 2016. The Company
recognized a net gain of $8.6 million on the sale of four properties during the third quarter of 2015. 

Net income attributable
to the Company decreased $0.3 million, to $14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $14.6 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 for the reasons set forth above. 

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 to
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

 Total rental income
increased $13.4 million, or 28%, to $60.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $47.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Approximately $14.5 million of the increase was due to the acquisition of additional
net lease properties and approximately $0.7 million was due to the development of new net lease properties. These increases were
partially offset by a reduction in minimum rental income of approximately $2.0 million relating to properties that were sold.
Other minimum rental income adjustments, such as base rent increases, attributed to an increase of $0.2 million. 

Operating cost reimbursements
increased $2.2 million, or 65%, to $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.2 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. Operating cost reimbursements increased primarily due to higher levels of recoverable property
operating expenses, including real estate taxes, acquisition, disposition and development activity. The portfolio recovery rate
was 94% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 86% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Other income remained
generally consistent with prior periods. 

Real estate taxes increased
$1.7 million, or 72%, to $4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.3 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due to the ownership of additional properties in 2016 compared to 2015 for which we
remit real estate taxes and are subsequently reimbursed by tenants. 

Property operating expenses
increased by $0.3 million, or 18%, to $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.4 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due to the ownership of additional properties in 2016 compared to 2015,
partially offset by the timing of certain expenses. 

Land lease payments
increased $0.1 million, or 11%, to $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.4 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is the result of the Company s acquisition of properties after the second
quarter of 2015 that are subject to land leases. 

General and administrative
expenses increased $0.9 million, or 18%, to $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily the result of increased employee count and associated
professional costs. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 9.2% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 from 10.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Depreciation and amortization
increased $4.2 million, or 34%, to $16.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $12.7 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of year-to-date acquisition and development activity. 

The Company recorded
no impairment charges during the first nine months of 2016. 

Interest expense increased
$2.3 million, or 26%, to $11.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense is primarily a result of the $40.0 million 2023 Term Loan issued in
July 2016 and the $60.0 million 2028 Senior Unsecured Notes issued August, 2016 which were offset by the repayment of the $8.6
million portfolio mortgage loan due 2016 and the repayment of the $2.4 million secured mortgage in the first quarter of 2015. 

The Company recognized
a net gain of $7.1 million during the first nine months of 2016, including (i) a gain of $3.5 million on the sale of a Walgreen s
in Rancho Cordova, California; (ii) a gain of $1.0 million on the sale of a Walgreens in Macomb, Michigan; and (iii) a
gain of $2.7 million on the sale of a Walgreens in Port St. John, Florida. The Company also recorded additional costs of
approximately $0.1 million associated with a property sold in the third quarter of 2015. During the first nine months of 2015,
the Company recognized a net gain of $12.1 million on the sale of eight properties, including (i) a gain of $3.3 million on the
sale of Marshall Plaza, a Kmart-anchored shopping center in Marshall, Michigan; (ii) a gain of $0.4 million on the sale of a former
Border s store in Lawrence, Kansas; (iii) a loss of $0.3 million on the sale of two outlots to the Company s Meijer
  occupied store in Plainfield, Indiana; (iv) a gain of $0.1 million on the sale of a Sonic restaurant in Waynesboro, Virginia;
(v) a gain of $8.0 million on the sale of Lakeland Plaza, a shopping center in Lakeland, Florida; and (vi) a gain of $0.6 million
on the sale of Ferris Commons, a shopping center located in Big Rapids, Michigan. 

Net income attributable
to the Company increased $1.2 million, to $32.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $31.2 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 for the reasons set forth above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 The Company s principal demands
for funds include payment of operating expenses, payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness, distributions
to its shareholders and future property acquisitions and development. 

On May 6, 2015, the Company implemented
a $100.0 million at-the-market equity program ( ATM program ) by entering into multiple equity distribution agreements
which the Company may, from time to time, sell shares of common stock. The Company uses the proceeds generated from its ATM program
for general corporate purposes including funding our investment activity, the repayment or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness,
working capital and other general purposes. 

The Company completed a follow-on offering
of 2,875,000 shares of common stock in May 2016. The offering, which included the full exercise of the overallotment option by
the underwriters, raised net proceeds of approximately $109.7 million after deducting the underwriting discount. The proceeds
from the offering were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. 

The Company expects to meet its short
term liquidity requirements through cash provided from operations and borrowings under its $150.0 million unsecured revolving
credit facility (the  Credit Facility ). As of September 30, 2016, $47.0 million was outstanding on the Credit Facility
and $103.0 million was available for future borrowings. The Company anticipates funding its long term capital needs through cash
provided from operations, borrowings under the Credit Facility, the issuance of long term debt or the issuance of common or preferred
equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred equity. 

We continually evaluate alternative financing
and believe that we can obtain financing on reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or
capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to us. 

Capitalization  

 As of September 30, 2016, the Company s
total market capitalization was approximately $1.6 billion. Market capitalization consisted of $1.2 billion of common equity (based
on the September 30, 2016 closing price on the NYSE of $49.44 per common share and assuming the conversion of operating partnership
units in the Operating Partnership ( OP units )) and $437.8 million of total debt, including (i) $70.6 million of
mortgage notes payable; (ii) $160.2 million of unsecured term loans; (ii) $160.0 million of senior unsecured notes; and (iii)
$47.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility. Our ratio of total debt to total market capitalization was 26.8% at September
30, 2016. 

At September 30, 2016, the non-controlling
interest in the Operating Partnership represented ownership of 1.4% of the Operating Partnership. The OP Units may, under certain
circumstances, be exchanged for shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis. The Company, as sole general partner of the Operating
Partnership, has the option to settle exchanged OP Units held by others for cash based on the current trading price of its shares.
Assuming the exchange of all OP Units, there would have been 24,231,839 shares of common stock outstanding at September 30, 2016. 

Debt  

   Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility   

 The Company has in place a $250.0 million
senior unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility (the  Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility ) consisting
of (i) a $150.0 million Credit Facility; (ii) a $65.0 million seven-year unsecured term loan facility (the  2021 Term Loan );
and (iii) a $35.0 million unsecured term loan facility due 2020 (the  2020 Term Loan ). 

The Credit Facility is due in July 2018, with an additional one-year extension at the Company s option, subject to customary conditions. Borrowings under
the Credit Facility are priced at LIBOR plus 135 to 200 basis points, depending on the Company s leverage. As of
September 30, 2016, $47.0 million was outstanding under the Credit Facility, bearing a weighted average interest rate of
approximately 1.87%; and $103.0 million was available for borrowing. 

I n
August 2016, the Company   entered
into a $20.3 million unsecured amortizing term loan that matures in May 2019 (the  2019 Term
Loan ).  Borrowings under the 2019 Term Loan are priced at LIBOR plus 170 basis points. In order to fix LIBOR on
the 2019 Term Loan at 1.92% until maturity, the Company had an interest rate swap agreement in place, which was assigned by
the lender under the Mortgage Note to the 2019 Term Loan lender.  As of September 30, 2016, $20.2 million was
outstanding under the 2019 Term Loan bearing an all-in interest rate of 3.62%.   

The 2020 Term Loan matures in September 2020. Borrowings under the 2020 Term Loan are priced at LIBOR plus 165 to 225 basis points, depending on the Company s leverage,
and the Company entered into interest rate swaps to fix LIBOR at 2.20% until maturity. As of September 30, 2016, $35.0 million
was outstanding under the 2020 Term Loan bearing an all-in interest rate of 3.85%. 

The 2021 Term Loan matures in July 2021.
Borrowings under the 2021 Term Loan are priced at LIBOR plus 165 to 225 basis points, depending on the Company s leverage,
and the Company entered into interest rate swaps to fix LIBOR at 2.09% until maturity. As of September 30, 2016, $65.0 million
was outstanding under the 2021 Term Loan bearing an all-in interest rate of 3.74%. 

In July 2016, the
Company completed a $40.0 million unsecured term loan facility that matures in July 2023 (the  2023 Term
Loan ).  Borrowings under the 2023 Term Loan are priced at LIBOR plus 165 to 225 basis points, depending on the
Company s leverage, and the Company entered into interest rate swap to fix LIBOR at 1.40% until maturity.  As of
September 30, 2016, $40.0 million was outstanding under the 2023 Term Loan, which is subject to an all-in interest rate of
3.05%.   

The Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility
contain customary covenants, including, among others, financial covenants regarding debt levels, total liabilities, tangible net
worth, fixed charge coverage, unencumbered borrowing base properties, and permitted investments. The Company was in compliance
with the covenant terms at September 30, 2016. 

Senior Unsecured Notes   

 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
$160.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding consisting of $50.0 million of 4.16% notes due May 30,
2025 (the  2025 Notes ), $50.0 million of 4.26% notes due in May 2027 (and, together with the 2025
Notes, the  Senior Unsecured Notes ) and $60 million of 4.42% notes due in July 2028 (the  2028 Senior
Unsecured Notes ). The weighted average term of the Senior Unsecured Notes is 11.3 years and the weighted average
interest rate is 4.29%. 

Mortgage Notes Payable   

 As of September 30, 2016,
the Company had total mortgage indebtedness of $70.6 million. Including our mortgages that have been swapped to a fixed interest
rate, our weighted average interest rate on mortgage debt was 4.83%. The following table summarizes our mortgage notes payable
as of September 30, 2016 (in thousands): 

(1) Includes the effects of variable interest
rates that have been swapped to fixed interest rates.  

  (2) Mortgage secured by three Wawa locations
was paid off on March 11, 2016 in the amount of $8.6 million.  

  (3) Secured Term Loan due 2017 secured by
seven locations was paid off August 18, 2016 in the amount of $20.3 million.  

The mortgage loans encumbering
our properties are generally non-recourse, subject to certain exceptions for which we would be liable for any resulting losses
incurred by the lender. These exceptions vary from loan to loan, but generally include fraud or a material misrepresentation,
misstatement or omission by the borrower, intentional or grossly negligent conduct by the borrower that harms the property or
results in a loss to the lender, filing of a bankruptcy petition by the borrower, either directly or indirectly, and certain environmental
liabilities. 

We have entered into mortgage loans which
are secured by multiple properties and contain cross-default and cross-collateralization provisions. Cross-collateralization provisions
allow a lender to foreclose on multiple properties in the event that we default under the loan. Cross-default provisions allow
a lender to foreclose on the related property in the event a default is declared under another loan. 

Contractual Obligations  

 The following table summarizes
our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 (in thousands): 

Estimated interest payments
are based on (i) the stated rates for mortgage notes payable, including the effect of interest rate swaps; (ii) the stated rates
for unsecured term loans, including the effect of interest rate swaps and assuming the interest rate in effect for the most recent
quarter remains in effect through the respective maturity dates; and (iii) the stated rates for senior unsecured notes. 

Dividends  

 During the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. The cash dividend was paid on October 14, 2016 to holders
of record on September 30, 2016. 

Inflation 

 The Company s leases
typically contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its results of operations. Tenant leases generally
provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases or increases in the consumer price index. Certain Company s
leases contain clauses enabling it to receive percentage rents based on tenants  gross sales, which generally increase as
prices rise. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, rent increases will not keep up with the rate of inflation. 

Substantially all of the
Company s properties are leased to tenants under long-term net leases, which require the tenant to pay certain operating
expenses for a property, thereby reducing the Company s exposure to operating cost increases resulting from inflation. Inflation
may have an adverse impact on the Company s tenants. 

Funds from Operations 

 Funds from Operations ( FFO )
is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (NAREIT) to mean net income computed in accordance
with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and any
impairment charges on a depreciable real estate asset, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
Management uses FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate the Company s business because there are certain limitations
associated with using GAAP net income by itself as the primary measure of the Company s operating performance. Historical
cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes
predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes
that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself. 

FFO should not be considered
as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of the Company s operating performance, or as an alternative to
cash flow as a measure of liquidity. Further, while the Company adheres to the NAREIT definition of FFO, its presentation of FFO
is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs due to the fact that all REITs may not use the same
definition. 

Adjusted Funds from Operations
( AFFO ) is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. AFFO
further adjusts FFO for certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with GAAP and for non-recurring
items that are not reflective of ongoing operations. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental measure of the Company s
performance, however, AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company s performance,
or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. The Company s computation of AFFO may differ
from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore may not be comparable to such other REITs.
Note that, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company adjusted its calculation of AFFO to exclude non-recurring capitalized
building improvements and to include non-real estate related depreciation and amortization. Management believes that these changes
provide a more useful measure of operating performance in the context of AFFO. 

The following table provides a reconciliation
from net income to FFO for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

ITEM 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk   

We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily
through borrowing activities. There is inherent roll-over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market
rates. The extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our
future financing requirements. 

Our interest rate risk is monitored using
a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal payments and the weighted average interest rates on outstanding
debt, by year of expected maturity, to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes. 

The fair value is estimated at $73.4 million,
$160.9 million and $159.5 million for mortgage notes payable, unsecured term loans and senior unsecured notes, respectively, as
of September 30, 2016. 

The table above incorporates those exposures
that exist as of September 30, 2016; it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date. As a
result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise
during the period and interest rates. 

We seek to limit the impact of interest rate
changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting
such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous. From time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements
or other interest rate hedging contracts. While these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates, they
also expose us to the risks that the other parties to the agreements will not perform, we could incur significant costs associated
with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify
as highly-effective cash flow hedges under GAAP guidance. 

In April 2012, we entered into a forward starting
interest rate swap agreement to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on $22.3 million
in variable-rate borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, we receive from the counterparty interest on
the notional amount based on one-month LIBOR and pay to the counterparty a fixed rate of 1.92%. This swap effectively converted
$22.3 million of variable-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings from July 1, 2013 to May 1, 2019. As of September 30, 2016,
this interest rate swap was valued as a liability of $0.5 million. 

In December 2012, we entered into interest
rate swap agreements to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on $25.0 million in
variable-rate borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, we receive from the counterparty interest on the
notional amount based on 1 mo. LIBOR and pay to the counterparty a fixed rate of 0.89%. This swap effectively converted $25.0
million of variable-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings from December 6, 2012 to April 4, 2018. As of September 30, 2016,
this interest rate swap was valued as a liability of $0.1 million. 

In September 2013, we entered into an interest
rate swap agreement to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on $35.0 million in
variable-rate borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, we receive from the counterparty interest on the
notional amount based on one-month LIBOR and pay to the counterparty a fixed rate of 2.20%. This swap effectively converted $35.0
million of variable-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings from October 3, 2013 to September 29, 2020. As of September 30, 2016,
this interest rate swap was valued as a liability of $1.8 million. 

In July 2014, we entered into interest rate
swap agreements to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on $65.0 million in variable-rate
borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, we receive from the counterparty interest on the notional amount
based on one-month LIBOR and pay to the counterparty a fixed rate of 2.09%. This swap effectively converted $65.0 million of variable-rate
borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings from July 21, 2014 to July 21, 2021. As of September 30, 2016, this interest rate swap was
valued as a liability of $3.4 million. 

In June 2016, we entered into an interest
rate swap agreement to hedge against changes in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rate on $40.0 million in
variable rate borrowings. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement, we receive from the counterparty interest on the
notional amount based on 1 mo. LIBOR and pay to the counterparty a fixed rate of 1.40%. The swap effectively converted $40.0 million
of variable-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings from August 1, 2016 to July 1, 2023. As of September 30, 2016, this interest
rate swap was valued as a liability of $0.8 million. 

We do not use derivative
instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we did not have any other derivative instruments or hedging activities
as of September 30, 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016, a 100 basis point
increase in interest rates on the portion of our debt bearing interest at variable rates would result in an increase in interest
expense of approximately $0.5 million.

Section 8.7.          Make-Whole
Amount . The term   Make-Whole Amount   means, with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount
of such Called Principal;  provided  that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining
the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings: 

Called
Principal   means, with respect to any Note, the principal of such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to  Section 8.2 
or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to  Section 12.1 , as the context requires. 

Discounted
Value   means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled
Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to
such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis
as that on which interest on such Note is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal. 

Reinvestment
Yield   means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the sum of (a) 0.50% (50 basis points) plus (b) the
yield to maturity implied by the  Ask Yield(s)  reported as of 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business
Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as  Page PX1  (or
such other display as may replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued actively traded on-the-run
U.S. Treasury securities (  Reported  ) having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal
as of such Settlement Date. If there are no such U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to such Remaining Average
Life, then such implied yield to maturity will be determined by (i) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent
yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (ii) interpolating linearly between the  Ask Yield(s) 
Reported for the applicable most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities with the maturities (1) closest
to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment
Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note. 

Agree Limited Partnership 
     Note Purchase Agreement  

If such yields
are not Reported or the yields Reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), then   Reinvestment
Yield   means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the sum of (x) 0.50% (50 basis points) plus (y) the
yield to maturity implied by the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have
been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal
Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any comparable successor publication) for the U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term
equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there is no such U.S. Treasury constant
maturity having a term equal to such Remaining Average Life, such implied yield to maturity will be determined by interpolating
linearly between (1) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining Average
Life and (2) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and less than such Remaining Average
Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable
Note. 

Remaining
Average Life   means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years obtained by dividing (a) such Called
Principal into (b) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (i) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled
Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (ii) the number of years, computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised
of twelve 30-day months and calculated to two decimal places, that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such
Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment. 

Remaining
Scheduled Payments   means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and
interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called
Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date;  provided  that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest
payments are due to be made under the terms of such Note, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will
be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to
 Section 8.2  or  12.1 . 

Settlement
Date   means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid
pursuant to  Section 8.2  or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to  Section 12.1 ,
as the context requires. 

Section 8.8.          Payments
Due on Non-Business Days.   Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, (x) except as set
forth in clause (y), any payment of interest on any Note that is due on a date that is not a Business Day shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable on such
next succeeding Business Day; and (y) any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount on any Note (including principal due on
the Maturity Date of such Note as designated in such Note) that is due on a date that is not a Business Day shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day and shall include the additional days elapsed in the computation of interest payable on such next
succeeding Business Day

accordance with GAAP on the books of the Company, the Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary or (b) the nonpayment of all such

Section 20.         Confidential
Information. 

For the purposes of
this  Section 20 ,   Confidential Information   means information delivered to any Purchaser by or on
behalf of the Parent Guarantor, the Company, or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that was clearly marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified
when received by such Purchaser as being confidential information of the Parent Guarantor, the Company or such Subsidiary, as the
case may be;  provided  that such term does not include information that (a) was publicly known or otherwise known to
such Purchaser prior to the time of such disclosure, (b) subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission by
such Purchaser or any Person acting on such Purchaser s behalf, (c) otherwise becomes known to such Purchaser other
than through disclosure by the Parent Guarantor, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (d) constitutes financial
statements delivered to such Purchaser under  Section 7.1  that are otherwise publicly available. Each Purchaser will

or disclose Confidential Information to (i) its directors, trustees, officers, employees, agents, attorneys and affiliates

financial advisors and other professional advisors who agree to hold confidential the Confidential Information substantially in
accordance with the terms of this  Section 20 , (iii) any other holder of any Note, (iv) any Institutional

in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this  Section 20 ),
(v) any Person from which it offers to purchase any security of the Parent Guarantor or the Company (if such Person has agreed
in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this  Section 20 ),
(vi) any federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such Purchaser, (vii) the NAIC or the SVO or,
in each case, any similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about such
Purchaser s investment portfolio or (viii) any other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or
appropriate (w) to effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to such Purchaser, (x) in response
to any subpoena or other legal process, (y) in connection with any litigation to which such Purchaser is a party or (z) if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent such Purchaser may reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure
to be necessary or appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the rights and remedies under such Purchaser s
Notes, the Guaranty and this Agreement. Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be
bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this  Section 20  as though it were a party to this Agreement. On reasonable
request by the Parent Guarantor and the Company in connection with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required
to be delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other than a holder that is a party to this Agreement
or its nominee), such holder will enter into an agreement with the Parent Guarantor and the Company embodying the provisions of
this  Section 20 . 

In the event that as
a condition to receiving access to information relating to the Obligors or its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated by or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, any Purchaser or holder of a Note is required to agree to a confidentiality
undertaking (whether through IntraLinks, another secure website, a secure virtual workspace or otherwise) which is different from
this  Section 20 , this  Section 20  shall not be amended thereby and, as between such Purchaser or such holder and the
Parent Guarantor and the Company, this  Section 20  shall supersede any such other confidentiality undertaking.

shall contain such Affiliate s agreement to be bound by this Agreement and shall contain a confirmation by such Affiliate
of the accuracy with respect to it of the representations set forth in  Section 6 . Upon receipt of such notice, any
reference to such Purchaser in this Agreement (other than in this  Section 21 ) shall be deemed to refer to such Affiliate
in lieu of such original Purchaser. In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a Purchaser hereunder and such Affiliate
thereafter transfers to such original Purchaser all of the Notes then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Parent Guarantor
and the Company of notice of such transfer, any reference to such Affiliate as a  Purchaser  in this Agreement (other
than in this  Section 21 ) shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall refer to such original Purchaser,

Agreement.

Terms . All accounting terms used herein which are not expressly defined in this Agreement have the meanings respectively given
to them in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, (i) all computations made pursuant to
this Agreement shall be made in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) all financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with

the computation of any financial covenant, ratio or other requirement set forth herein, then upon the request of the Company or
the Required Holders, the Company, the Guarantors, and the holders of Notes shall negotiate promptly, diligently and in good faith
in order to amend the provisions of this Agreement such that such financial covenant, ratio or other requirement shall continue
to provide substantially the same financial tests or restrictions of the Company and the Guarantors as in effect prior to such
accounting change, as determined by the Required Holders in their good faith judgment. Until such time as such amendment shall
have been executed and delivered by the Company, the Guarantors and the Required Holders (i) such financial covenants, ratio and
other requirements, and all financial statements and other documents required to be delivered under this Agreement, shall be calculated
and reported as if such change had not occurred and (ii) the Parent Guarantor shall provide to each holder of a Note that is an
Institutional Investor financial statements and other documents required under this Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder
setting forth a reconciliation between calculations of such ratio or requirement made before and after giving effect to such change
in generally accepted accounting principles. For purposes of determining compliance with this Agreement (including, without limitation,
 Section 9 ,  Section 10  and the definition of  Indebtedness ), any election by the Company to measure
any financial liability using fair value (as permitted by Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification
Topic No. 825-10-25    Fair Value Option,  International Accounting Standard 39    Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement  or any similar accounting standard) shall be disregarded and such determination shall be made as if such election
had not been made.

Section 22.3.          Severability .

or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

therefor pursuant to  Section 13 , (b) subject to  Section 22.1 , any reference herein to any Person shall

doubt, all Schedules and Exhibits attached to this Agreement shall be deemed to be a part hereof.

constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together
signed by all, of the parties hereto.
