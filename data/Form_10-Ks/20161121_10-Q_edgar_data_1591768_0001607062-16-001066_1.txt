2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

   THE
FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF KM WEDDING EVENTS MANAGEMENT,
INC. AND THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   Overview
of Our Business   

  We
have been involved in the wedding services industry in South India since 2004.  KM  is our brand, which is a short
form for  KalyanaMalai  meaning  Wedding Garland  in South Indian language. Our services include Matrimonial
(Matchmaking) Services ( Matrimonial Services ) and Wedding Services (until June 30, 2015). Considering various business
related and socio-economic aspects, the Company has decided to have a dedicated focus on Matrimonial Services business commencing
July 1, 2015.  

  Matrimonial
Services include matchmaking and partner identification, through multiple delivery channels via print and visual media, website,
physical centers and events. In order to increase traction in the Matrimonial services business, we started leasing wedding halls
(physical infrastructures where a wedding is conducted, similar to banquet halls of hotels). The first wedding hall has already
commenced operations.  

  In
India, we currently focus on the geographic locations of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh (two of the Southern States in India).
We believe that we are well positioned to utilize the potential of the Wedding Services market because of our early presence in
this market since 2004. We have conducted promotional events across the U.S.to capture the market potential. We are continuing
our efforts to expand our presence in the US. Our target customers include the Indian high-income group, higher middle-income
group, and other affluent individuals both in the U.S. and India. This segment, being upwardly mobile and comfort and service
focused, is the right target group for our business strategy.  

  We,
through our subsidiary KM India, have been servicing the Indian Diaspora in the U.S. through our website since 2004 which was
followed up by Community Meets (events focused on bringing together individuals who are seeking a life partner and who share similar
backgrounds (e.g., profession, socio-economic background, religion, etc.) conducted during the fiscal year 2011 in 5 cities (New
York City, South Windsor (Connecticut), Boston, Houston and San Antonio) which was attended by approximately 1,200 prospective
matrimonial customers. In October 2013, we also filmed for SUN TV across 6 different US cities (New York, South Windsor Connecticut),
New Brunswick, San Jose, Dallas and Houston), which was attended by over 5,400 South Indian community members.  

  Based
on the experience gained from the above activities, we believe that there is a demand and need in the Indian Diaspora in the U.S.
for our Matrimonial Services. We believe a customized and focused approach is required to market to this segment. The current
plan for exploring this business opportunity includes setting up offices in the U.S. (fiscal 2016), growing Matrimonial Services
for weddings to be fixed in India by Indians in the U.S. launching a customized website for Matrimonial Services in the U.S. market

Cash
flows from Operating Activities    

  During
the six month period ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $28,809 compared to net cash provided
by operating activities of $17,470 during the corresponding period in the previous year.  

    Cash

  During
the six month period ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by investing activities was $6,993 compared to net cash used
in investing activities of $7,329 for the corresponding period in the previous year.  

    Cash

the six month period ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $10,991 compared to net cash provided

    Future
Capital Needs    

  At
September 30, 2016, our working capital deficit was $721,144 and we had $2,402 in cash and cash equivalents. We have evaluated
our expected cash requirements over the next twelve months, and have determined that our existing cash resources are not sufficient
to meet our anticipated needs during the next twelve months, and that additional financing is required to support current operations.
In addition, we anticipate that further additional financing may be required to fund our business plan subsequent to that date,
until such time as revenues and related cash flows become sufficient to support our operating costs.  

  The
successful implementation of our business plan is dependent upon us receiving sufficient funds from the sale of securities and/or
additional funding from management, the issuance of equity or debt, or through obtaining a credit facility. In additional, substantial
expenditures will be required to enable us to expand and scale up our operations and quality of services. We will require additional
financing from issuance of equity or debt, or through obtaining a credit facility, to execute our plan of operations. Our established
bank-financing arrangements will not be adequate. Although management believes that the additional required funding will be obtained
through the sale of securities, there is no guarantee we will be able to obtain the additional required funds in the future or
that funds will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If such funds are not available, management will be required
to curtail its investments in additional sales and marketing and product development resources, and capital expenditures, which
may have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows and results of operations, and its ability to continue operating as
a going concern.

Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  Disclosure
controls and procedures  include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
the issuer s management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management. Our management
(with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act). Based
on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.
