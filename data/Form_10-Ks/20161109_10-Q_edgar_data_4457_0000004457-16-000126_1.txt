               notes to condensed consolidatED financial statements   
                1.Basis of Presentation  
              AMERCO, a Nevada corporation ( AMERCO ), has a   second   fiscal quarter that ends on the 30  th   of   September   for each year that is referenced. Our insurance company subsidiaries have a   second   quarter that ends on the 3  0  th   of   June   for each year that is referenced. They have been consolidated on that basis. Our insurance companies  financial reporting processes conform to calendar year reporting as required by state insurance departments. Management believes that consolidating their calendar year into our fiscal year financial statements does not materially affect the   presentation of   financial position or results of operations.   We   disclose any material events  , if any,   occurring during the intervening period. Consequently, all references to our insurance subsidiaries  years 201  6   and 20  15   correspond to fiscal 201  7   and 201  6   for AMERCO.  
              Accounts denominated in non-U.S. currencies have been translated into U.S. dollars. Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.   
              The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30  , 201  6   and the related condensed consolidated statements of operations  , comprehensive income (loss) for the second quarter and first six months   and cash flows for the   first six months of   fiscal 201  7   and 201  6   are unaudited.  
              In our opinion, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of such condensed consolidated financial statements have been included. Such adjustments consist only of normal recurring items. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information in this   Quarterly Report on Form   10-Q   ( Quarterly Report )   should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis   of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   and financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 201  6  .  
              Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

AMERCO and consolidated entities

              2. Earnings per Share  
              Our earnings per share is calculated by dividing our earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding, basic and diluted.  
              The weighted average common shares outstanding exclude post-1992 shares of the employee stock ownership plan that have not been committed to be released. The unreleased shares  ,   net of shares committed to be released  ,     were   21,219   and     9,280   as of   September 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively.   
              3. Investments  
              Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  
              We   deposit bonds with insurance regulatory authorities to meet statutory requirements. The adjusted cost of bonds on deposit with insurance regulatory authorities   was $  17.2   million   and $17.3 million   at   September 30  , 201  6 and March 31, 2016, respectively  .  
              Available-for-Sale Investments  
              Available-for-sale investments at   September 30  , 201  6   were as follows:

AMERCO AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES  
                  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)    

Available-for-sale investments at   March 31  , 201  6   were as follows:  
             
              The   available-for-sale   table  s   include gross unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position.  
              We   sold available-for-sale securities with a fair value   of   $120.7   million during the first six months of fiscal 201  7  . The gross realized gains on these sales totaled   $3.1   million.   The   gross   realized losses on these sales   totaled $0.9 million  .  
              The unrealized losses of more than twelve months in the available-for-sale table  s   are considered temporary declines. We track each investment with an unrealized loss and evaluate   it   on an individual basis for other-than-temporary impairments including obtaining corroborating opinions from third party sources, performing trend analysis and reviewing management s future plans. Certain of these investments may have declines   determined by management   to be other-than-temporary and we recognize these write-downs  , if any,   through earnings  . There were no write downs in the second quarter or for the first six months of fiscal 2017 or 2016.  
              The investment portfolio primarily consists of corporate securities and U.S. government securities.   We   believe   we   monitor   our   investments as appropriate.   Our   methodology of assessing other-than-temporary impairments is based on security-specific analysis as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time to maturity, the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments. Nothing has come to   management s   attention that would lead to the belief that each issuer would not have the ability to meet the remaining contractual obligations of the security, including payment at maturity.   We have   the ability and intent not to sell   our   fixed maturity and common stock investments for a period of time sufficient to allow   us   to recover   our   costs.  
              The portion of other-than-temporary impairment related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings.   The significant inputs utilized in the evaluation of   credit losses on   mortgage backed securities include ratings, delinquency rates, and prepayment activity. The significant inputs utilized in the evaluation of   credit losses on   asset backed securities include the time frame for principal recovery and the subordination and value of the underlying collateral.   
              There were no credit losses recognized in earnings for which a portion of an other-than-temporary impairment was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the second quarter or first six months of fiscal 2017.

              We   manage exposure to changes in market interest rates.   Our   use of derivative instruments is limited to highly effective interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of changes in cash flows (future interest payments) attributable to changes in LIBOR swap rates, the designated benchmark interest rate being hedged on certain of our LIBOR indexed variable rate debt   and a variable rate operating lease  . The interest rate swaps effectively fix   our   interest payments on certain LIBOR indexed variable rate debt.   We   monitor   our   positions and the credit ratings of   our   counterparties and do not currently anticipate non-performance by the counterparties. Interest rate swap agreements are not entered into for trading purposes.

              PODS Enterprises, Inc. v. U-Haul International, Inc.  
              On July 3, 2012, PODS Enterprises, Inc. ( PEI ), filed a lawsuit against U-Haul International, Inc. ( U-Haul ), in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, alleging (1) Federal Trademark Infringement under Section 32 of the Lanham Act, (2) Federal Unfair Competition under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, (3) Federal Trademark dilution by blurring in violation of Section 43(c) of the Lanham Act, (4) common law trademark infringement under Florida law, (5) violation of the Florida Dilution; Injury to Business Reputation statute, (6) unfair competition and trade practices, false advertising and passing off under Florida common law, (7) violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, and (8) unjust enrichment under Florida law.    
              The claims arose from U-Haul s use of the word  pod  and  pods  as a generic term for its U-Box moving and storage product. PEI alleged that such use is an inappropriate use of its PODS mark.  Under the claims alleged in its Complaint, PEI sought a Court Order permanently enjoining U-Haul from: (1) the use of the PODS mark, or any other trade name or trademark confusingly similar to the mark; and (2) the use of any false descriptions or representations or committing any acts of unfair competition by using the PODS mark or any trade name or trademark confusingly similar to the mark. PEI also sought a Court Order (1) finding all of PEI s trademarks valid and enforceable and (2) requiring U-Haul to alter all web pages to promptly remove the PODS mark from all websites owned or operated on behalf of U-Haul. Finally, PEI sought an award of damages in an amount to be proven at trial, but which   were   alleged to be approximately $70 million. PEI also sought pre-judgment interest, trebled damages, and punitive damages.

U-Haul d  id   not believe that PEI s claims ha  d   merit and vigorously defended the lawsuit.  On September 17, 2012, U-Haul filed its Counterclaims, seeking a Court Order declaring that: (1) U-Haul s use of the term  pods  or  pod  does not infringe or dilute PEI s purported trademarks or violate any of PEI s purported rights; (2)   t  he purported mark  PODS  is not a valid, protectable, or registrable trademark; and (3)   t  he purported mark  PODS PORTABLE ON DEMAND STORAGE  is not a valid, protectable, or registrable trademark. U-Haul also sought a Court Order cancelling the marks at issue in the case.  
              The case was tried to   a   jury beginning on September 8, 2014.   
              On September 25, 2014, the jury returned a unanimous verdict, finding in favor of PEI and against U-Haul on all claims and counterclaims.  The jury awarded PEI $45 million in actual damages and $15.7 million in U-Haul s alleged profits attributable to its use of the term  pod  or  pods  .       
              On October 1, 2014, the Court ordered briefing on U-Haul s oral motion for directed verdict on its genericness defense, the motion on which the Court had deferred ruling during trial.  Pursuant to the Court s order, the parties  briefing on that motion was completed by October 21, 2014.  
              After hearing previously deferred motions,   on March 11, 2015, the Court entered Judgment on the jury verdict in favor of PEI and against U-Haul in the amount of $60.7 million.   This was recorded as an accrual in our financial statements.  
              On August 24, 2015, the Court entered a permanent injunction, and awarded PEI $4.9 million in pre-judgment interest, $82,727 in costs, and post-judgment interest at the rate of 0.25%, beginning March 11, 2015, computed daily and compounded annually. This was recorded as an accrual of $5.0 million in our financial statements during fiscal 2016.     
              On September 13, 2016, before oral argument, before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the parties reached a settlement in principle, for $41.4 million.  On October 10, 2016, the parties signed a formal written settlement agreement.  U-Haul wired the settlement payment on or about October 12, 2016.  The parties are in the process of completing their remaining respective performances under the terms of the settlement agreement.    
              Environmental  
              Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments may significantly affect Real Estate s business operations. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Real Estate is aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of its properties. Real Estate regularly makes capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws and has put in place a remedial plan at each site where it believes such a plan is necessary. Since 1988, Real Estate has managed a testing and removal program for underground storage tanks.  
              Based upon the information currently available to Real Estate, compliance with the environmental laws and its share of the costs of investigation and cleanup of known hazardous waste sites are not expected to result in a material adverse effect on AMERCO s financial position or results of operations.  
              Other  
              We are   named as a defendant in various other litigation and claims arising out of the normal course of business. In management s opinion, none of these other matters will have a material effect on   our   financial position and results of operations.  
              10  . Related Party Transactions

( Galaxy ) and Private Mini pursuant to a standard form of management agreement, under which   we   receive a management fee of between 4% and 10% of the gross receipts plus reimbursement for certain expenses.   We   received   cash payments for   management fees, exclusive of reimbursed expenses,   of   $15.5 million   from the above mentioned entities during   both   the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7   and 201  6  . This management fee is consistent with the fee received for other properties   we   previously managed for third parties. SAC Holdings, 4 SAC, 5 SAC, Galaxy and Private Mini are substantially controlled by Blackwater.   Mark V. Shoen controls the general partner of   Mercury  . The limited partner interests of Mercury are indirectly owned   by Mark V. Shoen  ,   James P.

              Related Party Costs and Expenses  

We   lease space for marketing company offices, vehicle repair shops and hitch installation centers from subsidiaries of SAC Holdings, 5 SAC and Galaxy. The terms of the leases are similar to the terms of leases for other properties owned by unrelated parties that are leased to   us  .   
              At   September 30  , 201  6  , subsidiaries of SAC Holdings, 4 SAC, 5 SAC, Galaxy and Private Mini acted as U-Haul independent dealers. The financial and other terms of the dealership contracts with the aforementioned companies and their subsidiaries are substantially identical to the terms of those with   our   other independent dealers whereby commissions are paid by   us   based upon equipment rental revenues  .     
              These agreements and note     with subsidiaries of SAC Holdings, 4 SAC, 5 SAC, Galaxy and Private Mini, excluding Dealer Agreements, provided revenues of   $14.6   million, expenses of   $  1.4   million   and cash flows of   $  13.6   million during the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7  . Revenues and commission expenses related to the Dealer Agreements were   $  152.6   million and $  32.9   million, respectively during the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7  .  
              Pursuant to the variable interest entity model under   Accounting Standards Codification (   ASC   )   810     Consolidation   ( ASC 810 )  ,   Management determined that the junior note of SAC Holdings   as well as   the management agreements with SAC Holdings, Mercury, 4 SAC, 5 SAC, Galaxy, and Private Mini represent  s   potential variable interests for us. Management evaluated whether it should be identified as the primary beneficiary of one or more of these VIEs using a two  -  step approach in which management (i) identified all other parties that hold interests in the VIEs, and (ii) determined if any variable interest holder has the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance.

Management determined that they do not have a variable interest in the holding entities   SAC Holding II   Corporation, Private Mini, Mercury, 4 SAC,     5 SAC, or Galaxy   based upon   management agreements which are with the individual operating entities   or through the issuance of junior debt  ;   therefore  ,     we are   precluded from consolidating these entities.   
              We have   junior debt with   the holding entity   SAC Holding Corporation which represents a variable interest   in the entity  . Though   we have   certain protective rights within th  is   debt agreement,   we have   no present influence or control over th  i  s holding entit  y   unless the protective rights become exercisable, which management considers unlikely based on their payment history. As a result,   we have   no basis under ASC 810 to consolidate th  i  s entit  y  .   
              We   do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the individual operating entities which have management agreements with U-Haul.   There are no fees or penalties disclosed in the management agreement for termination of the agreement.   Through control of the holding entities      assets, and its ability and history of making key decisions relating to the entity and its assets, Blackwater, and its owner, are the variable interest holder with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact each of the individual holding entities and the individual operating entities  performance.  As a result,   we have   no basis under ASC 810 to consolidate these entities.  
              We have   not provided financial or other support explicitly or implicitly during   the quarter   ended   September   3  0  , 201  6   to any of these entities that   it was   not previously contractually required to provide.   In addition, we currently have no plan to provide any financial support to any of these entities in the future.

1  1  . Consolidating Financial Information by Industry Segment  
              AMERCO s three reportable segments are:  
             
                  Moving and Storage, comprised of AMERCO, U-Haul, and Real Estate and the subsidiaries of U-Haul and Real Estate,  
                  Property and Casualty Insurance, comprised of Rep  w  est and its subsidiaries and ARCOA,   and  
                  Life Insurance  ,   comprised of Oxford and its subsidiaries.  
             
              Management tracks revenues separately, but does not report any separate measure of the profitability for rental vehicles, rentals of self-storage spaces and sales of products that are required to be classified as a separate operating segment and accordingly does not present these as separate reportable segments. Deferred income taxes are shown as liabilities on the condensed consolidating statements.  
              The information includes elimination entries necessary to consolidate AMERCO, the parent, with its subsidiaries.  
              Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for by the parent using the equity method of accounting.

              The components of the net periodic benefit costs with respect to postretirement benefits were as follows:  

1  4  . Fair Value Measurements  
              Fair values of cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to maturity. Fair values of short term investments, investments available-for-sale, long term investments, mortgage loans and notes on real estate, and interest rate swap contracts are based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. Fair values of trade receivables approximate their recorded value.  
              Our   financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, trade receivables, reinsurance recoverables and notes receivable. Limited credit risk exists on trade receivables due to the diversity of our customer base and their dispersion across broad geographic markets.   We place     our   temporary cash investments with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.  
              We have   mortgage receivables, which potentially expose   us   to credit risk. The portfolio of notes is principally collateralized by   self-  storage facilities and commercial properties.   We have   not experienced any material losses related to the notes from individual or groups of notes in any particular industry or geographic area. The estimated fair values were determined using the discounted cash flow method and using interest rates currently offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.  
              The carrying amount of long term debt and short term borrowings are estimated to approximate fair value as the actual interest rate is consistent with the rate estimated to be currently available for debt of similar term and remaining maturity.  
              Other investments including short term investments are substantially current or bear reasonable interest rates. As a result, the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate fair value.

              Certain a  ssets and liabilities   are   recorded at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets   and are   measured and classified based upon a three tiered approach to valuation. ASC 820   -   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure   ( ASC 820 )   requires that financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:  
              Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;    
              Level 2   Quoted prices for identical or similar financial instruments in markets that are not considered to be active, or similar financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means;   and  
              Level 3   Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and are unobservable. These reflect management s assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.  
              A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table  s   represent the financial assets and liabilities   on the condensed consolidated balance sheet   at   September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016  , that are subject to ASC 820 and the valuation approach applied to each of these items.

ITEM 2.     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
                General  
              We begin Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) with the overall strategy of AMERCO, followed by a description of  ,   and     strategy related to, our operating segments to give the reader an overview of the goals of our businesses and the direction in which our businesses and products are moving. We then discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.   Next, w  e discuss our results of operations for the   second   quarter   and first six months   of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   second   quarter   and first six months   of fiscal 201  6  , which   is   followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and a discussion of our financial commitments in the sections entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources   - Summary   and Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments   and a discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements  . We conclude this MD A by discussing our   current   outlook for the remainder of fiscal 201  7  .  
              This MD A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Quarterly Report, including the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The various sections of this MD A contain a number of forward-looking statements, as discussed under the caption  ,   Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  ,   all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk  s   described throughout this filing or in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the   fiscal   year ended March 31, 201  6  .   Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control and our   actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements.  
              AMERCO, a Nevada corporation  ,   has a   second   fiscal quarter that ends on the 30  th   of   September   for each year that is referenced. Our insurance company subsidiaries have a   second   quarter that ends on the 3  0  th   of   June   for each year that is referenced. They have been consolidated on that basis. Our insurance companies  financial reporting processes conform to calendar year reporting as required by state insurance departments. Management believes that consolidating their calendar year into our fiscal year financial statements does not materially affect the financial position or results of operations.   We   disclose any material events occurring during the intervening period. Consequently, all references to our insurance subsidiaries  years 201  6   and 20  15   correspond to fiscal 201  7   and 201  6   for AMERCO.  
              Overall Strategy  
              Our overall strategy is to maintain our leadership position in the North American  do-it-yourself  moving and storage industry. We accomplish this by providing a seamless and integrated supply chain to the  do-it-yourself  moving and storage market. As part of executing this strategy, we leverage the brand recognition of   U-Haul     with our full line of moving and self-storage related products and services and the convenience of our broad geographic presence.    

36  

Our primary focus is to provide our customers with a wide selection of moving rental equipment, convenient self-storage rental facilities  , portable moving and storage units   and related moving and self-storage products and services. We are able to expand our distribution and improve customer service by increasing the amount of moving equipment   and   storage rooms   and portable moving and storage units   available for rent, expanding the number of independent dealers in our network and expanding and taking advantage of our eMove      capabilities.  
              Property and Casualty Insurance     is focused on providing and administering property and casualty insurance to U-Haul and its customers, its independent dealers and affiliates.    
              Life Insurance     is focused on long-term capital growth through direct writing and reinsuring of life   insurance  , Medicare supplement and annuity products in the senior marketplace.  
              Description of Operating Segments  
              AMERCO s three reportable segments are:  
             
                  Moving and Storage, comprised of AMERCO, U-Haul, and Real Estate and the   wholly-owned   subsidiaries of U-Haul and Real Estate,  
                  Property and Casualty Insurance, comprised of Repwest and its   wholly-owned   subsidiaries and ARCOA, and  
                  Life Insurance, comprised of Oxford and its   wholly-owned   subsidiaries.  
             
               Moving and Storage    
                Moving and Storage   consists of the rental of trucks, trailers,   portable moving and storage units,   specialty rental items and self-storage spaces primarily to the household mover as well as sales of moving supplies, towing accessories and propane. Operations are conducted under the registered trade name U-Haul      throughout the United States and Canada.  
              With respect to our truck, trailer, specialty rental items and self-storage rental business, we are focused on expanding our dealer network, which provides added convenience for our customers and expanding the selection and availability of rental equipment to satisfy the needs of our customers.  
              U-Haul brand self-moving related products and services, such as boxes, pads and tape allow our customers to, among other things; protect their belongings from potential damage during the moving process. We are committed to providing a complete line of products selected with the  do-it-yourself  moving and storage customer in mind.  
              uhaul.com   is an online marketplace that connects consumers to   our operations as well as   independent Moving Help      service providers and   thousands of   independent Self-Storage Affiliates. Our network of customer     rated affiliates   and service providers furnish   pack and load help, cleaning help, self-storage and similar services, all over North America. Our goal is to further utilize our web-based technology platform to increase service to consumers and businesses in the moving and storage market.  
              Since 1945,   U-Haul has incorporated sustainable practices into its everyday operations. We believe that our basic business premise of equipment sharing helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduces the   inventory of   total large capacity vehicles. We   continue to look for ways to reduce waste within our business   and are dedicated to manufacturing reusable components and recyclable products. We believe that our commitment to sustainability, through our products and services and everyday operations has helped us to reduce our impact on the environment.  
              Property and Casualty Insurance   
              Property and Casualty Insurance   provides loss adjusting and claims handling for   U-Haul   through regional offices across North America. Property and Casualty Insurance also underwrites components of the   Safemove, Safetow, Safemove   Plus, Safestor     and     Safestor   Mobile     protection packages to   U-Haul   customers. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of these products into the   moving and storage   market. The business plan for Property and Casualty Insurance     includes offering property and casualty products in other   U-Haul     related programs.    

37  

Life Insurance   
              Life Insurance   provides life and health insurance products primarily to the senior market through the direct writing   and   reinsuring of life insurance, Medicare supplement and annuity policies.  
              Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
              Our   financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. Certain accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments and assumptions, often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain.  
              Following is   a detailed description   of   the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us and that require management s most difficult and subjective judgments. These estimates are based on historical experience, observance of trends in particular areas, information and valuations available from outside sources and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions; such differences may be material.  
              We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as revenue recognition; however, these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates, because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. The accounting policies that we deem most critical to us, and involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments include the following:  
              Principles of Consolidation  
              We   appl  y   ASC 810 -   Consolidation   ( ASC 810 ) in   our   principles of consolidation. ASC 810 addresses arrangements where a company does not hold a majority of the voting or similar interests of a variable interest entity ( VIE ). A company is required to consolidate a VIE if it has determined it is the primary beneficiary. ASC 810 also addresses the policy when a company owns a majority of the voting or similar rights and exercises effective control.  
              As promulgated by ASC 810, a VIE is not self-supportive due to having one or both of the following conditions:   (i  ) it has an insufficient amount of equity for it to finance its activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support or   (ii  ) its owners do not hold the typical risks and rights of equity owners. This determination is made upon the creation of a variable interest and   is   re-assessed   on an on-going basis   should certain changes in the operations of a VIE, or its relationship with the primary beneficiary trigger a reconsideration under the provisions of ASC 810. After a triggering event occurs the facts and circumstances are utilized in determining whether or not a company is a VIE, which other company(s) have a variable interest in the entity, and whether or not the company s interest is such that it is the primary beneficiary.  
              We will continue to monitor our relationships with the other entities regarding who is the primary beneficiary, which could change based on facts and circumstances of any reconsideration events.    

38  

Recoverability of Property, Plant and Equipment   
              Our p  roperty, plant and equipment   is   stated at cost. Interest expense incurred during the initial construction of buildings and rental equipment is considered part of cost. Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line or an accelerated method based on a declining balance formula over the following estimated useful lives: rental equipment 2-20 years and buildings and non-rental equipment 3-55 years. Routine maintenance costs are charged to operating expense as they are incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of property, plant and equipment are netted against depreciation expense when realized. Equipment depreciation is recognized in amounts expected to result in the recovery of estimated residual values upon disposal, i.e., minimize gains or losses. In determining the depreciation rate, historical disposal experience, holding periods and trends in the market for vehicles are reviewed.   As a result of changes in IRS regulations regarding the capitalization of assets, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we raised the value threshold before certain assets are capitalized within our depreciation policy. This change in threshold, results in the immediate recognition of reported operating costs with a lagging decrease in depreciation expense over the term that these assets would have been depreciated. This change in threshold is expected to benefit us through the immediate recognition of tax deductible costs.  
              We regularly perform reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the carrying amount of assets, including estimates of residual value, may not be recoverable or that the useful life of assets are shorter or longer than originally estimated. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the   remaining   life of the equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks and trailers. We assess the recoverability of our assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles and the expected life of vehicles included in the fleet. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those   assets  .   If   asset residual values are determined to be recoverable, but the useful lives are shorter or longer than originally estimated, the net book value of the assets is depreciated over the newly determined remaining useful lives.  
              M  anagement   determined that additions to the fleet   resulting from purchase  s   should be depreciated on an accelerated method   based upon a declining formula.     Under the declining balances method (2.4 times declining balance), the book value of a rental truck is reduced approximately 16%, 13%, 11%, 9%, 8%, 7%, and 6% during years one through seven, respectively  ,   and then reduced on a straight line basis   to a salvage value of 20  % by the end of year fifteen.   Beginning in October 2012, rental equipment subject to this depreciation schedule will be depreciated to a salvage value of 15%. Comparatively,   a standard straight line approach would reduce the book value by approximately 5.  7  % per year over the life of the truck.  
              Although we intend to sell our used vehicles for prices approximating book value, the extent to which we realize a gain or loss on the sale of used vehicles is dependent upon various factors including   but not limited to,   the general state of the used vehicle market, the age and condition of the vehicle at the time of its disposal and the depreciation rates with respect to the vehicle  .   We typically sell our used vehicles at our sales centers throughout North America, on our web site at uhaul.com/trucksales or by phone at 1-866-404-0355. Additionally, we sell a large portion of our pickup and cargo van fleet at automobile dealer auctions.  
              Insurance Reserves   
              Liabilities for life insurance and certain annuity and health policies are established to meet the estimated future obligations of policies in force, and are based on mortality, morbidity and withdrawal assumptions from recognized actuarial tables which contain margins for adverse deviation. In addition, liabilities for health, disability and other policies include estimates of payments to be made on insurance claims for reported losses and estimates of losses incurred, but not yet reported   ( IBRN )  . Liabilities for annuity contracts consist of contract account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders.    

39  

Insurance reserves for Property and Casualty Insurance and U-Haul take into account losses incurred based upon actuarial estimates and are management s best approximation of future payments.  These estimates are based upon past claims experience and current claim trends as well as social and economic conditions such as changes in legal theories and inflation.  These reserves consist of case reserves for reported losses and a provision for losses IBNR, both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverables, resulting in a net liability  .  
              Due to the nature of the underlying risks and high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the liability for future policy benefits and claims, the amounts to be ultimately paid to settle these liabilities cannot be precisely determined and may vary significantly from the estimated liability, especially for long-tailed casualty lines of business such as excess workers  compensation.  As a result of the long-tailed nature of the excess workers      compensation policies written by Repwest during 1983 through 200  1  , it may take a number of years for claims to be fully reported and finally settled.  
              On a regular basis insurance reserve adequacy is reviewed by management to determine if existing assumptions need to be updated  .   In determining the assumptions for calculating workers      compensation reserves, management considers multiple factors including the following:  
             
                  Claimant longevity  
                  Cost trends associated with claimant treatments  
                  Changes in ceding entity and third party administrator reporting practices  
                  Changes in environmental factors including legal and regulatory  
                  Current conditions affecting claim settlements  
                  Future economic conditions including inflation  
             
              We have   reserved each claim based upon the accumulation of current claim costs projected through   each   claimant     s life expectancy, and then adjusted for applicable reinsurance arrangements.  Management reviews each claim bi-annually to determine if the estimated life-time claim costs have increased and then adjusts the reserve estimate accordingly at that time.  We have factored in an estimate of what the potential cost increases could be in our IBNR liability.  We have not assumed settlement of the existing claims in calculating the reserve amount, unless it is in the final stages of completion.  
              Continued increases in claim costs, including medical inflation and new treatments and medications could lead to future adverse development resulting in additional reserve strengthening.  Conversely, settlement of existing claims or if injured workers return to work or expire prematurely, could lead to future positive development.  
              Impairment of Investments  
              Investments are evaluated pursuant to guidance contained in ASC 320 -   Investments - Debt and Equity Securities   to determine if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost is other-than-temporary. Management makes certain assumptions or judgments in its assessment including but not limited to:   our   ability and intent to   hold   the security, quoted market prices, dealer quotes or discounted cash flows, industry factors, financial factors, and issuer specific information such as credit strength. Other-than-temporary impairment in value  , if any,   is recognized in the current period operating results.   There were no write downs in the second quarter or first six months of fiscal 2017 or 2016.  
              Income Taxes  
              We   file a consolidated tax return with   all of its legal subsidiaries.  
              Our   tax returns are periodically reviewed by various taxing authorities. The final outcome of these audits may cause changes that could materially impact our financial results.

Fair Values  
              Fair values of cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to maturity. Fair values of short term investments, investments available-for-sale, long term investments, mortgage loans and notes on real estate, and interest rate swap contracts are based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. Fair values of trade receivables approximate their recorded value.  
              Our   financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, trade receivables, reinsurance recoverables and notes receivable. Limited credit risk exists on trade receivables due to the diversity of our customer base and their dispersion across broad geographic markets.   We place our   temporary cash investments with f  inancial institutions and limit   the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.  
              We have   mortgage receivables, which potentially expose   us   to credit risk. The portfolio of notes is principally collateralized by   self-  storage facilities and commercial properties.   We have   not experienced any material losses related to the notes from individual or groups of notes in any particular industry or geographic area. The estimated fair values were determined using the discounted cash flow method and using interest rates currently offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.  
              The carrying amount of long term debt and short term borrowings are estimated to approximate fair value as the actual interest rate is consistent with the rate estimated to be currently available for debt of similar term and remaining maturity.  
              Other investments including short term investments are substantially current or bear reasonable interest rates. As a result, the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate fair value.  
              Adoption of New   Accounting Pronouncements  
              In March     2015, the   Financial Accounting Standards Board (   FASB   )   issued   Accounting Standards Update     (   ASU   )   2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . The amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. The guidance   wa  s effective for interim periods and   the   annual period beginning after December 15, 2015. T  he adoption of this standard   did   not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
              Recent   Accounting Pronouncements  
              In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , an updated standard on revenue recognition. The standard creates a five-step model for revenue recognition that requires companies to exercise judgment when considering contract terms and relevant facts and circumstances. The standard requires expanded disclosure surrounding revenue recognition. Early application is not permitted. The standard   was initially to be   effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption.   In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Deferral of Effective Date  , which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , which is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and the effective date is the same as requirements in ASU 2015-14.   We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01  ,   Financial Instruments   Overall (subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other provisions, the new guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in certain equity securities. For investments without readily determinable fair values, entities have the option to   either measure these investments at fair value or at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment. All changes in measurement will be recognized in net income. The guidance is effective for interim periods and annual period beginning after December 15, 201  7  . Early adoption is not permitted, except for certain provisions relating to financial liabilities.   We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.  
              In February 2016, the FASB issued   ASU   2016-02  ,   Leases   (Topic 842)  . This update will require lessees to recognize all leases with terms greater than 12 months on their balance sheet as lease liabilities with a corresponding right-of-use asset. This update maintains the dual model for lease accounting, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance, with lease classification determined in a manner similar to existing lease guidance. The basic principle is that leases of all types convey the right to direct the use and obtain substantially all the economic benefits of an identified asset, meaning they create an asset and liability for lessees. Lessees will classify leases as either finance leases (comparable to current capital leases) or operating leases (comparable to current operating leases). Costs for a finance lease will be split between amortization and interest expense, with a single lease expense reported for operating leases. This update also will require both qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance is effective for interim periods and annual period beginning after December 15, 201  8; however e  arly   adoption is   permitted.   We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.   For the last nine years, we have reported a discounted estimate of the off-balance sheet lease obligations in our MD A.  
              In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326)  . This update will require that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected credit losses during the period. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct write-down to the security. This update will become effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.  
              In August 2016, the   FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments     ( ASU 2016-15 )  .   This update   addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.     The effective date of ASU 2016-15 is for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.   Early adoption is permitted.   The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.  
              In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  , which will require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.     This update will become effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted.      The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,   Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control  , which modifies existing guidance with respect to how a decision maker that holds an indirect interest in a variable interest entity ( VIE ) through a common control party determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE as part of the analysis of whether the VIE would need to be consolidated. Under the ASU, a decision maker would need to consider only its proportionate indirect interest in the VIE held through a common control party. Previous guidance had required the decision maker to treat the common control party s interest in the VIE as if the decision maker held the interest itself. As a result of the ASU, in certain cases, previous consolidation conclusions may change. This update will become effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.      The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.  
              From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or the SEC that are adopted by   us   as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, these ASUs entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and therefore will have minimal, if any, impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption.  
              Results of Operations  
              AMERCO and Consolidated Entities  
              Quarter Ended   September   30, 201  6   compared with the Quarter Ended   September   30, 201  5  
              Listed below on a consolidated basis are revenues for our major product lines for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7   and the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  :  
             
              Self-moving equipment rental revenues increased $  13.5   million during the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared   with t  he   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  .    The improvement in revenue was generated from an increase in transactions.  The average number of rental trucks in the fleet increased compared with the same quarter last year.    
              Self-storage revenues   increased $  10.1   million during the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , com  pared with the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6.    The average monthly amount of occupied square feet increased by   12.8  % during the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the same period last year.  The growth in revenues and square feet rented comes from a combination of improved rates per square foot, occupancy gains at existing locations and from the addition of new facilities to the portfolio.   Over the last twelve months we added approximately 3.5   million net rentable square feet or a   15.7  % increase, with approximately   0.5   mil  lion of that coming on during the second   quarter   of fiscal 2017  .  
              Life insurance premiums   in  c  reased $  0.4   million during the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   2016   due primarily to increased life and Medicare supplement premiums  .  
              Property and casualty insurance premiums increased $  0.6   million during the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal 2016 due to an increase in Safetow     and   Safestor sales which is a reflection of the increased equipment and storage rental transactions.    

43  

Net investment and interest income increased $  3.7   million during the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6     due to   a larger invested asset base at our insurance companies and gains generated from our mortgage loan portf  o  lio.           
              Other revenue   in  creased $  7.7   million during the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6,   primarily   coming from growth in our   U-Box  TM   program.  
              As a result of the items mentioned above, revenues for AMERCO and its consolidated entities were   $  998.9   million for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared with $  962.9   million for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  .  
              Listed below are revenues and earnings     from operations at each of our operating segments for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7   and the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  . The insurance companies   second   quarters ended   June 30  , 201  6   and 20  15  .  
             
              Total costs and expenses   increased $  39.9   million   during the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal   201  6. Our insurance segments accounted for $4.0 million of the increase primarily due to increased benefit costs.  Moving and Storage total costs and expenses increased $36.1 million  .   In October 2016, we settled the litigation with PODS Enterprises, LLC ( PEI ), see Note 9, Contingencies. As part of this settlement, we paid $41.4 million to PEI. In fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, we recorded $66.0 million as accrued contingencies and interest. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recognized the difference between our contingency accrual and the actual settlement as a $24.6 million reduction of operating expenses.  Excluding the effect of the reversal of this accrual during the quarter, o  perating expenses for     Moving and Storage   in  creased $  16.5   million  . P  ersonnel costs  , equipment maintenance, property tax and a change in the accounting threshold for the expensing of smaller capital items led to the additional costs.    Depreciation expense increased $  23.6   million   due to the additional amount of equipment in the rental fleet.  G  ains from the disposal of property, plant and equipment   decreased $23.2 million. This resulted in an increase of $46.8 million in depreciation expense, net.  Compared with the second quarter of last year we have sold fewer used trucks. On average the trucks sold had a higher average cost and we experienced a decrease in the average sales proceeds per unit.  L  ease expense decreased $  3.4   million as a result of   our shift   in financing new equipment on the balance sheet versus through operating leases  ; this ongoing shift in financing allocation also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense  .  
              As a result of the above mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations   de  creased to $  307.2   million for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared with $  311.1   million for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  .  
              Interest expense for the   second   quarter of   fiscal 2017   was $  28.2   million, compared with $  24.0   million for the second quarter of fiscal 201  6     primarily due to increased borrowings.       

44  

Income tax expense was $  102.5   million for the second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared with $  103.7   million for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  .     
              As a result of the above mentioned items, earnings available to common shareholders were   $  176.5   million for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared with $  183.4   million for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  .  
              Basic and diluted earnings per share for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7   were   $  9.01  , compared with $  9.36   for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  .  
              The weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted were   19,586,411   for   the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared with   19,5  97  ,  717   for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  .  
              Moving and Storage  
              Quarter Ended   September   30, 201  6   compared with the Quarter Ended   September   30, 201  5  
              Listed below are revenues for the major product lines at our Moving and Storage operating segment for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7   and the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  :  
             
              Self-moving equipment rental revenues increased $  13.6   million during the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared   with the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  .    The improvement in revenue was generated from an increase in transactions.  The average number of rental trucks in the fleet increased compared to the same quarter last year.  
              Self-storage revenues   increased $  10.1   million during the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , com  pared with the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6.    The average monthly amount of occupied square feet increased by   12.8  % during the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the same period last year.  The growth in revenues and square feet rented comes from a combination of improved rates per square foot, occupancy gains at existing locations and from the addition of new facilities to the portfolio.   Over the last twelve months we added approximately 3.5   million net rentable square feet or a   15.7  % increase, with approximately   0.5   mil  lion of that coming on during the second   quarter   of fiscal 2017  .  
              Net investment and interest income increased $0.5 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with the second quarter of fiscal   201  6  .       
              Other   revenue   in  creased $  7.9   million during the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6   caused primarily by   growth in   the U-Box  TM   program.

The Company owns and manages self-storage facilities. Self-storage revenues reported in the consolidated financial statements represent Company-owned locations only. Self-storage data for our owned storage locations follows:  
             
              Over the last twelve months we added approximately 3.5 million net rentable square feet of new storage to the system. This was a mix of existing storage locations we acquired and new development. On average, the occupancy rate of this new capacity on the date it was added was 19%.  
              Total costs and expenses   in  creased $  36.1   million during the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  .    In October 2016, we settled the litigation with PEI, see Note 9, Contingencies. As part of this settlement, we paid $41.4 million to PEI.

G  ains from the disposal of property, plant and equipment   decreased $23.2 million. This resulted in an increase of $46.8 million in depreciation expense, net.  Compared with the second quarter of last year we have sold fewer used trucks. On average the trucks sold had a higher average cost and we experienced a decrease in the average sales proceeds per unit.   
              As a result of the above mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations for Moving and Storage before consolidation of the equity in the earnings of the insurance subsidiaries  ,   de  creased to $  293.2   million   for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with $297.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016.  
              Equity in the earnings of AMERCO s insurance subsidiaries   was     $  9.3 million   and $  9.2   million   for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7 and   201  6, respectively  .  
              As a result of the above mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations   de  creased to $  302.5   million for   the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  7  , compared with $  306.3   million for the   second   quarter of fiscal 201  6  .

A significant portion of Repwest s premiums are from policies sold in conjunction with U-Haul rental transactions. The premium increase corresponded with the increased moving and storage transactions at U-Haul during the same time period as well as from sales of Safestor through independent storage operators not owned or managed by U-Haul.  
              Net investment income was $3.  9   million and $  3.3   million for the second quarters ended June 30, 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively.   The increase was the result of a larger invested asset base  .  
              Net operating expenses were $  7.2   million and $  7.1   million for the second quarters ended June 30, 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively   an     i  ncrease in current year commission expense was offset by various reductions in   operating costs  .  
              Benefits and losses incurred were $  3.6   million and $  3.5   million for the second quarters ended June 30, 201  6   and 201  5,     due to increased incurred losses resulting from additional premium volume  .    

46  

As a result of the above mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, pretax earnings from operations were $  7.1   million and $  6.1   million for the second quarters ended June 30, 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively.  
              Life Insurance  
              Quarter Ended   June 30, 2016   compared with the Quarter Ended   June 30  , 20  15  
              Net premiums were   $40.9 million and $40.5   million     for the   quarters   ended   June 30  ,     201  6   and 201  5  ,     respectively  . Medicare Supplement premiums increased $0.3 million due to an increase in renewal premium, offset by a decrease in new sales. Life and other premiums increased $0.1 million. Annuity deposits, which are accounted for on the balance sheet as deposits, were $56.0 million, a decrease of $20.4 million compared with the same period last year.  
              Net investment   and interest   income was $  19.8   million and $  17.2   million for the   quarters   ended   June 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively  . Investment income increased by $2.6 million due to a gain from our mortgage loan portfolio and a larger invested asset base.  
              Net operating expenses   were   $  5.6   million   and $5.5 million   for the   quarters   ended   June 30  , 201  6   and 201  5.  
              Benefits and losses incurred were $  43.3   million and $  40.0   million for the   quarters   ended   June 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively  . Incurred Medicare supplement benefits increased $2.5 million resulting from the increase in policies in force and the increased benefit to premium ratio. Life and other incurred benefits decreased $0.3 million. Interest credited to policyholders increased $1.1 million from the increased deferred annuity deposit base, offset by lower interest credited on policyholder accounts   indexed to an S P index.  
              Amortization of deferred acquisition costs ( DAC )  , sales inducement asset ( SIA )   and the value of business acquired ( VOBA ) was $  6.0   million     and $  5.6   million for the   quarters   ended   June 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively  . The variance was primarily due to an increase in the deferred costs associated with more in force annuity policies.  
              As a result of the above mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, pretax earnings from operations were $  7.1   million and $  8.1   million for the   quarters   ended   June 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively.

              Listed below on a consolidated basis are revenues for our major product lines for the first six months of fiscal 201  7   and the first six months of fiscal 201  6  :  
             
              Self-moving equipment rental revenues increased $  30.5   million during the   first six months   of fiscal 201  7  , compared   with t  he first   six months   of fiscal 201  6.  The improvement in revenue was generated from an increase in transactions.  The average number of rental trucks in the fleet increased compared with the same period last year.

Self-storage revenues   increased $  20.6   million during the   first six months   of fiscal 201  7  , com  pared with the   first six months   of fiscal 201  6.    The average monthly amount of occupied square feet increased by   13.5  % during the   first six months   of fiscal 2017 compared with the same period last year.  The growth in revenues and square feet rented comes from a combination of improved rates per square foot, occupancy gains at existing locations and from the addition of new facilities to the portfolio.   Over the last twelve months we added approximately 3.5   million net rentable square feet or a   15.7  % increase, with approximately   1.5   mil  lion of that coming on during the first six months of fiscal 2017  .  
              Life insurance premiums   in  c  reased $  1.0   million during the   first six months   of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   first six months   of fiscal   2016   due   primarily to increased life and Medicare supplement premiums  .  
              Property and casualty insurance premiums increased $  1.3   million during the   first six months   of fiscal 2017, compared with the   first six months   of fiscal 2016 due to an increase in Safetow     and   Safestor sales which is a reflection of the increased equipment and storage rental transactions.  
              Net investment and interest income increased $  9.2   million during the   first six months   of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   first six months   of fiscal 201  6     due to   a larger invested asset base at our insurance companies and gains generated from our mortgage loan portf  o  lio  .        
              Other revenue   in  creased $  11.3   million during the   first six months   of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   first six months   of fiscal 201  6,   primarily   coming from growth in our   U-Box  TM   program.  
              As a result of the items mentioned   above, revenues for AMERCO and its consolidated entities were   $  1,922.3   million for the first six months of fiscal 201  7  , as compared with $  1,847.7   million for the first six months of fiscal 201  6  .  
              Listed below are revenues and earnings from operations at each of our operating segments for the first six months of fiscal 201  7   and the first six months of fiscal 201  6  . The insurance companies      first six months ended   June   30, 201  6   and 20  15  .  
             
              Total costs and expenses   increased $  109.8   million   during the   first six months   of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   first six months   of fiscal   201  6. Our insurance segments accounted for $11.0 million of the increase primarily due to increased benefit costs.

Moving and Storage total costs and expenses increased $99.1 million  .    In October 2016, we settled the litigation with PEI, see Note 9, Contingencies. As part of this settlement, we paid $41.4 million to PEI. In fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, we recorded $66.0 million as accrued contingencies and interest. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recognized the difference between our contingency accrual and the actual settlement as a $24.6 million reduction of operating expenses.      Excluding the effect of the reversal of this accrual during fiscal 2017, o  perating expenses for Moving and Storage   in  creased $  38.3   million  . Pe  rsonnel costs  , equipment maintenance, property tax and a change in the accounting threshold for the expensing of smaller capital items led to the additional costs.   Depreciation expense increased $  40.7   million   due to the additional amount of equipment in the rental fleet.  G  ains from the disposal of property, plant and equipment   decreased $50.5 million. This resulted in an increase of $91.2 million in depreciation expense, net.  Compared with the first six months of last year we have sold fewer used trucks. On average the trucks sold had a higher average cost and we experienced a decrease in the average sales proceeds per unit.  L  ease expense decreased $  9.4   million as a result of   our shift   in financing new equipment on the balance sheet versus through operating leases  ; this ongoing shift in financing allocation also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense  .  
              As a result of the above mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations   de  creased to $  567.0   million for the   first six months of fiscal 2017  , as compared with $  602.2   million for the first six months of fiscal 201  6  .  
              Interest expense   for the first six months of fiscal 2017   was $  54.9   million, compared with $4  6.1   million for the first six months of fiscal 201  6     primarily due to increased borrowings  .    
              Income tax expense was $  188.5   million for the first six months of fiscal 201  7  , compared with $  201.4   million for first six months of fiscal 201  6     due to higher pretax earnings for the first six months of fiscal 2016.  
              As a result of the above mentioned items, earnings available to common shareholders were   $  323.6   million   for   the first six months of fiscal 201  7  , compared with $  354.7   million   for   the first six months of fiscal 201  6  .   
              Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the first six months of fiscal 201  7   were   $  16.52  , compared with $  18.10   for the first six months of fiscal 201  6  .  
              The weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted were   19,586,240   for the first six months of fiscal 201  7  , compared with   19,5  96  ,  921   for the first six months of fiscal 201  6  .

              Six Months Ended September 30, 201  6   compared with the Six Months Ended September 30, 20  15  
              Listed below are revenues for the major product lines at our Moving and   Storage   operating segment for the first six months of fiscal 201  7   and the   first six months of fiscal 2016  :  
             
              Self-moving equipment rental revenues increased $  30.6   million during the   first six months   of fiscal 201  7  , compared   with the   first six months   of fiscal 201  6. The improvement in revenue was generated from an increase in transactions.  The average number of rental trucks in the fleet increased compared to the same period last year.

Self-storage revenues   increased $  20.6   million during the   first six months   of fiscal 201  7  , com  pared with the   first six months   of fiscal 201  6.    The average monthly amount of occupied square feet increased by   13.5  % during the   first six months   of fiscal 2017 compared with the same period last year.  The growth in revenues and square feet rented comes from a combination of improved rates per square foot, occupancy gains at existing locations and from the addition of new facilities to the portfolio.   Over the last twelve months we added approximately 3.5   million net rentable square feet or a   15.7  % increase, with approximately   1.5   mil  lion of that coming on during the first six months of fiscal 2017  .  
              Net investment and interest income decreased $0.2 million during the first six months of fiscal 2017, compared with the first six months of fiscal   201  6  .       
              Other   revenue   in  creased $  11.5   million during the   first six months   of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   first six months   of fiscal 201  6   caused primarily by   growth in   the U-Box  TM   program.  
              The Company owns and manages   self-storage   facilities. Self  -storage   revenues reported in the consolidated financial statements represent Company-owned locations only. Self  -storage   data for our owned   storage   locations follows:  
             
              Over the last twelve months we added approximately 3.5 million net rentable square feet of new storage to the system. This was a mix of existing storage locations we acquired and new development. On average, the occupancy rate of this new capacity on the date it was added was 19%.  
              Total costs and expenses   in  creased $  99.1   million during the   first six months   of fiscal 201  7  , compared with the   first six months   of fiscal 201  6  .

              As a result of the above mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations for Moving and Storage before consolidation of the equity in the earnings of the insurance subsidiaries de  creased to $  541.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017, compared with $577.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2016.  
              Equity in the earnings of AMERCO s insurance subsidiaries   was   $  16.9 million   for the first six months of fiscal 201  7  , compared with   $16.1 million for   the first six months of fiscal 201  6  .  
              As a result of the above mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations   de  creased to $  558.5   million for the   first six months of fiscal 2017  , compared with $  593.8   million for the first six months of fiscal 201  6  .

Property and Casualty Insurance  
              Six Months Ended June 30, 201  6   compared with the Six Months Ended June 30, 201  5  
              Net premiums were $2  5.3   million and $2  3  .  9   million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  A significant portion of Repwest s premiums are from policies sold in conjunction with U-Haul rental transactions. The premium increase corresponded with increased moving and storage transactions at U-Haul during the same time period.  
              Net investment income was $  9.5   million and $  7.6   million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   The increase was primarily due to $2.  4   million in gains on the repayment of mortgage lo  ans compared with $0.7   million in the same period last year   along   with additional income from an increased invested asset base.  
              Net operating expenses were $13.  5   million and $1  3  .  4   million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,   due primarily to an increase in commissions   partially offset by various reductions in operating costs  .  
              Benefits and losses incurred were $  6.7   million and $  5.5   million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.     The increase was primarily due to $0.4 million of adverse development during the   six months   ended June 30, 2016 coupled with $0.5 million of positive re  serve development in the six months   ended June 30, 2015. The majority of the reserve development in both years occurred in the Safe programs.  
              As a result of the above mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, pretax earnings from operations were $  14.6   million and $1  2.5   million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
              Life Insurance  
              Six Months Ended June 30, 201  6   compared with the Six Months Ended June 30, 20  15  
              Net premiums were $  81.8   million and $  80.8   million for the   six months   ended   June 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  ,     respectively  . The increase was primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in   Medicare supplement   renewal premiums offset by the reduction in sales. Other Annuity deposits, which are accounted for on the balance sheet, were $111.8 million an increase of $1.5 million, compared with the same period last year.  
              Net investment income was $  39.8   million and $  32.3   million for the   six months   ended   June 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively.   The increase was attributable to gains from our mortgage loan portfolio in addition to increased investment income from a larger invested asset base.     
              Net operating expenses were $  11.6   million and $  11.3   million for the   six months   ended   June 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively.   
              Benefits and losses incurred were $  87.2   million and $  81.3   million for the   six months   ended   June   3  0  , 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively  .   Medicare supplement benefits   increased by $5.3 million as a result of the increase in policies in force and the increased benefit to premium ratio.  All other products lines accounted for a $0.6 million increase.  
              Amortization of DAC, SIA and VOBA was $13.9 million and $10.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was due to additional DAC amortization generated by investment gains along with increased amortization associated with a larger DAC asset.  
              As a result of the above mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, pretax earnings from operations were $11.0 million and $12.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
              Liquidity and Capital Resources  
              We believe our current capital structure is a positive factor that will enable us to pursue our operational plans and goals  ,   and provide us with sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future.   T  here are many factors which could affect our liquidity, including some which are beyond our control,   and   there is no assurance that future cash flows   and liquidity resources   will be sufficient to meet our outstanding debt obligations and our other future capital needs.

At   September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents totaled $  921.3   million, compared with $  600.6   million   at   March 31, 201  6  . The assets of our insurance subsidiaries are generally unavailable to fulfill the obligations of non-insurance operations (  Moving and Storage  ). As of   September 30, 2016   (or as otherwise indicated), cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets (receivables, short-term investments, other investments, fixed maturities, and related party assets) and   debt   obligations of each operating segment were:  
             
              At September 30, 2016,   Moving and Storage     had   additional cash available under   existing credit facilities of   $  63.0   million  . The majority of invested cash at the Moving and Storage segment is held in government money market funds.  
              Net cash pro  vided by operating activities   increased $  19.9   million in the first six months of fiscal 201  7   compared with the first six months of fiscal 201  6.  The improvement in Moving and Storage was due to a reduction in federal income tax payments. The first six months of fiscal 2016 included a $56.8 million payment from Private Mini that did not recur this year.   
              Net cash used in investing activities   in  creased $  82.0   million   in the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7, compared with the first six months of fiscal   201  6  .   Purchases of property, plant and   equipment, which are reported net of cash from sales and lease-back transactions,   in  creased $  41.0   million. Cash from the sales of property, plant and equipment decreased $  68.8   million largely due to reduced fleet sales.     For our insurance subsidiaries, net cash used in investing activities decreased $27.2 million due to higher investment sales proceeds compared with the prior year period.    
              Net cash   provided   by fina  ncing   activities   de  creased   $139.1   million in the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7  , as compared with   the first six months of   fiscal 201  6. This was due to a combination of decreased debt and capital lease repayments of $23.9 million, a decrease in cash from borrowings of $129.9 million and a decrease in net annuity deposits from Life Insurance of $33.6 million.  
              Liquidity and Capital Resources and Requirements of Our Operating Segments  
              Moving and Storage  
              To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Capital expenditures have primarily   consisted of   new rental equipment acquisitions and the buyouts of existing fleet from leases. The capital to fund these expenditures has historically been obtained internally from operations and the sale of used equipment and externally from debt and lease financing. In the future, we anticipate that our internally generated funds will be used to service the existing debt and fund operations. U-Haul estimates that during fiscal 201  7,     we   will reinvest in   our   truck and trailer rental fleet   approximately   $  665   million  , net of equipment sales excluding any lease buyouts. Through the first   six months   of   fiscal 2017,   we have invested  , net of sales, approximately   $  357 million before any lease buyouts in our truck and trailer fleet of this projected amount  . Fleet investments in fiscal 201  7   and beyond will be dependent upon several factors including availability of capital, the truck rental environment and the used-truck sales market. We anticipate that the fiscal 201  7   investments will be funded largely through debt financing, external lease financing and cash from operations. Management considers several factors including cost and tax consequences when selecting a method to fund capital expenditures. Our allocation between debt and lease financing can change from year to year based upon financial market conditions which may alter the cost or availability of financing options.

Real Estate has traditionally financed the acquisition of self-storage properties to support U-Haul s growth through debt financing and funds from operations and sales.   Our   plan for the expansion of owned storage properties includes the acquisition of existing self-storage locations from third parties, the acquisition and development of bare land, and the acquisition and redevelopment of existing buildings not currently used for self-storage.   We are   funding these development projects through   construction loans and   internally generated funds. For the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7  ,   we invested approximately $252   million in real estate acquisitions, new construction and renovation and   major   repair  s  . For   the remainder of   fiscal 201  7  , the timing of new projects will be dependent upon several factors including the entitlement process, availability of capital, weather, and the identification and successful acquisition of target properties. U-Haul s growth plan in self-storage also includes the expansion of the   U-Haul Storage Affiliate   program, which does not require significant capital.  
              Net capital expenditures (purchases of property, plant and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment   and lease proceeds  ) were $  450.9   million and $  341.1   million for the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7   and 201  6  , respectively.   The components of our net capital expenditures are provided in the following table:  
             
              Moving and Storage continues to hold significant cash and has access to additional liquidity. Management may invest these funds in our existing operations, expand our product lines or pursue external opportunities in the self-moving and storage market place or reduce existing indebtedness where possible.  
              Property and Casualty Insurance  
              State insurance regulations restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders of insurance companies. As a result, Property and Casualty Insurance s assets are generally not available to satisfy the claims of AMERCO or its legal subsidiaries.  
              We believe that stockholder s equity at Property and Casualty Insurance remains sufficient and we do not believe that its ability to pay ordinary dividends to AMERCO will be restricted per state regulations.  
              Property and Casualty Insurance s s  tockholder s equity was $  178.4   million and $  160.6   million at   June 30, 2016   and December 31, 20  15  , respectively. The   increase resulted from net earnings of $  9.6   m  illion     and a  n     in  crease in   other comprehensive income of $  8.2   million.     Property and Casualty Insurance     does not use debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has no direct exposure to capital market conditions other than through its investment portfolio.  
              Life Insurance  
              Life Insurance manages its financial assets to meet policyholder and other obligations including investment contract withdrawals   and deposits  . Life Insurance s     net   deposits   for the   first six months   ended   June 30, 2016   were $  80.6   million. State insurance regulations restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders of insurance companies. As a result, Life Insurance s funds are generally not available to satisfy the claims of AMERCO or its legal subsidiaries.    

53  

Life Insurance s     stockholder s equity was $  310.1   million and $  271.7   million at   June 30, 2016   and December 31, 20  15  , respectively. The   in  crease resulted from   net   earnings of $  7.3   million   and an     in  crease in other comprehensive income of $  31.1   million. Life Insurance   has   not   historically   use  d   debt or equity issues to   increase capital and therefore has not had   any significant   direct exposure to capital market conditions other than through its investment portfolio.   However, a  s of   June 30  , 201  6,   Oxford had   outstanding deposits of   $  30.0   million   through its membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system ( FHLB ). For a more detailed discussion of this deposit, please see Note 4, Borrowings, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
              Cash Provided     from Operating Activities by Operating Segments  
              Moving and Storage  
              Net   cash provided from operating activities were $  720.9   million and $  695.6   million for the first six months of fiscal 201  7 and 2016  , respectively   due to a reduction in federal income tax payments. The first six months of fiscal 2016 included a $56.8 million payment from Private Mini that did not recur this year.  
              Property and Casualty Insurance  
              Net cash provided by operating activities were $8.8 million and $6.3 million for the first six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   Operating cash flows increased due to increased written premiums.  
              Property and Casualty Insurance s     cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolio  s   amounted to $  41.1   million   and $  24.3   million at   June 30, 2016   and December 31, 20  15  , respectively. Th  ese   balance  s   reflect funds in transition from maturity proceeds to long term investments. Management believes this level of liquid assets, combined with budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet foreseeable cash needs. Capital and operating budgets allow Property and Casualty Insurance     to schedule cash needs in accordance with investment and underwriting proceeds.  
              Life Insurance  
              Net cash provided by operating activities were $  23.3   million and $  31.2   million for the six months ended June 30, 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively  .     Operating cash flows decreased due to timing of collection of receivables and settlement of payables, offset by an increase in collected investment income and a reduction in federal income taxes paid.  
              In addition to cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, a substantial amount of liquid funds are available through Life Insurance s short-term portfolio   and its membership in the FHLB  . At   June 30, 2016   and December 31, 20  15  , cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments amounted to $  30.9   million and $  25.5   million, respectively.     Management believes that the overall sources of liquidity   are   adequate to meet foreseeable cash needs.  
              Liquidity and Capital Resources - Summary  
              We believe we have the financial resources needed to meet our business plans   including our working capital needs. We continue to hold significant cash and have access to existing credit facilities and additional liquidity   to meet our   anticipated   capital expenditure   requirements   for investment in our rental fleet, rent  al equipment and storage acquisitions and build outs.  
              Our borrowing strategy is primarily focused on asset-backed financing and rental equipment     leases. As part of this strategy, we seek to ladder maturities and hedge floating rate loans through the use of interest rate swaps. While each of these loans typically contain  s   provisions governing the amount that can be borrowed in relation to specific assets, the overall structure is flexible with no limits on overall Company borrowings. Management   believes   it has adequate liquidity between cash and cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity in existing   credit   facilities to meet the current and expected needs of the Company over the next several years. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   available borrowing capacity   under existing credit facilities of $  63.0   million. It is possible that circumstances beyond our control could alter the ability of the financial institutions to lend us the unused lines of credit.   W  e believe that there are additional opportunities for leverage in our existing capital structure.     For a more detailed discussion of our long-term debt and borrowing capacity, please see Note 4, Borrowings of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
              Certain a  ssets and liabilities   are   recorded at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets   and are   measured and classified based upon a three tiered approach to valuation. ASC 820 requires that financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value be classified and disclosed in a Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 category. For more information, please see Note   14,   Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.    
              The available-for-sale securities held by   us   are recorded at fair value. These values are determined primarily from actively traded markets where prices are based either on direct market quotes or observed transactions. Liquidity is a factor considered during the determination of the fair value of these securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for certain securities or the market for them has slowed or ceased. In situations where the market is determined to be illiquid, fair value is determined based upon limited available information and other factors including expected cash flows. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $0.3 million   of available-for-sale assets     classified in Level 3.  
              The interest rate swaps held by   us   as hedges against interest rate risk for our variable rate debt are recorded at fair value. These values are determined using pricing valuation models which include broker quotes for which significant inputs are observable. They include adjustments for counterparty credit quality and other deal-specific factors, where appropriate and are classified as Level 2.  
              Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments  
              Our estimates as to future contractual obligations have not materially changed from the disclosure included under the subheading   Disclosures about   Contractual Obligations   and Commercial Commitments   in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 201  6  .  
              Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
              We   use off-balance sheet arrangements in situations where management believes that the economics and sound business principles warrant their use.  
              We   utilize operating leases for certain rental equipment and facilities with terms expiring substantially   through 2019. In   the event of a shortfall in proceeds from the sales of the underlying rental equipment assets,   we have   guaranteed $  20.4   million of resid  ual values at September 30, 2016   for these assets at the end of their respective lease terms.   We have   been leasing rental equipment since 1987. To date, we have not experienced residual value shortfalls related to these leasing arrangements. Using the average cost of fleet related debt as the discount rate, the present value of   our   minimum lease payments and residual value guarantees were $  46.6   million at   September 30, 2016  .  
              Historically,   we have   used off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with the expansion of our self-storage business. For more information please see   Note 10, Related   Party Transactions  ,   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   These arrangements were primarily used when   our   overall borrowing structure was more limited.   We   do not face similar limitations currently and off-balance sheet arrangements have not been utilized in our self-storage expansion in recent years. In the future,   we   will continue to identify and consider off-balance sheet opportunities to the extent such arrangements would be economically advantageous to   us   and   our   stockholders.  
              We   currently manage the self-storage properties owned or leased by SAC Holdings, Mercury, 4 SAC, 5 SAC, Galaxy, and Private Mini pursuant to a standard form of management agreement, under which   we   receive a management fee of between 4% and 10% of the gross receipts plus reimbursement for certain expenses.   We   received management fees, exclusive of reimbursed expenses, of   $15.5 million   from the above mentioned entities   for both   the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7   and 201  6  . This management fee is consistent with the fee received for other properties   we   previously managed for third parties. SAC Holdings, 4 SAC, 5 SAC, Galaxy and Private Mini are substantially controlled by Blackwater.   Blackwater is wholly-owned by Willow Grove Holdings LP, which is owned by Mark V. Shoen (a significant shareholder) and various trusts associated with Edward J. Shoen (our Chairman of the Board, President and a significant shareholder) and Mark V. Shoen. Mark V. Shoen controls the general partner of Mercury. The limited partner interests of Mercury are indirectly owned by Mark V. Shoen, James P. Shoen (a significant shareholder) and a trust benefitting the children and grandchild of Edward J. Shoen  .    

55  

We   lease space for marketing company offices, vehicle repair shops and hitch installation centers from subsidiaries of SAC Holdings, 5 SAC and Galaxy. Total lease payments pursuant to such leases were   $1.4 million and $  1.3   million   in the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7   and 201  6, respectively  . The terms of the leases are similar to the terms of leases for other properties owned by unrelated parties that are leased to   us  .  
              At   September 30, 2016  , subsidiaries of SAC Holdings, 4 SAC, 5 SAC, Galaxy and Private Mini acted as U-Haul independent dealers. The financial and other terms of the dealership contracts with the aforementioned companies and their subsidiaries are substantially identical to the terms of those with   our   other independent dealers whereby commissions are paid by   us   based on equipment rental revenues.   We   paid the above mentioned entities   $  32.9   million and $  31.3   million in commissions pursuant to such dealership contracts during the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7   and 201  6  , respectively.  
              During the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7,   a subsidiary of ours   held   a   junior unsecured note of SAC Holdings. Substantially all of the equity interest of SAC Holdings is controlled by Blackwater.   We   do not have an equity ownership interest in SAC Holdings.   We   recorded interest income   of $2.5 million and received cash interest payments of $2.3 million from SAC   Holdings   for both   the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7   and 201  6  . The largest aggregate amount of   the   note receivable outstanding during the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7   was $  49.3   million and the aggregate note receivable balance at   September 30, 2016   was   $48.7   million. In accordance with the terms of th  is   note, SAC Holdings may prepay the notes without penalty or premium at any   time.   The scheduled maturity   of th  is   note   is   2017.  
              These agreements along with notes with subsidiaries of SAC Holdings, 4 SAC, 5 SAC, Galaxy and Private Mini, excluding Dealer Agreements, provided revenues of $  14.6   million, expenses of   $  1.4   million and cash flows of $  13.6   million during the first six months of fiscal 201  7  . Revenues and commission expenses related to the Dealer Agreements were $  152.6   million and $  32.9   million, respectively during the first six months of fiscal 201  7  .  
              Fiscal 201  7   Outlook  
              We will continue to focus our attention on increasing transaction volume and improving pricing, product and utilization for self-moving equipment rentals. Maintaining an adequate level of new investment in our truck fleet is an important component of our plan to meet   our operational   goals. Revenue in the U-Move program could be adversely impacted should we fail to execute in any of these areas. Even if we execute our plans, we could see declines in revenues   primarily     due to   adverse economic conditions   or heightened competition   that   is   beyond our control.   
              W  ith respect to our storage business, w  e have added new locations and expanded at existing locations. In fiscal 201  7,   we are   actively   looking   to acquire new locations,   complete current projects and increase occupancy in our existing portfolio of locations. New projects and   acquisitions will be considered and pursued if they fit our long-term plans and meet our financial objectives  .   We will continue to invest capital and resources in the U-Box program throughout fiscal 201  7  .  
              Property and Casualty Insurance will continue to provide loss adjusting and claims handling for U-Haul and underwrite components of the Safemove, Safetow, Safemove   Plus,   Safestor   and Safestor Mobile   protection packages to U-Haul customers.  
              Life Insurance is pursuing its goal of expanding its presence in the senior market through the sales of its Medicare supplement, life and annuity policies. This strategy includes growing its agency force, expanding its new product offerings, and pursuing business acquisition opportunities.

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures   A  bout Market Risk  
                We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To mitigate these risks, we may utilize derivative financial instruments, among other strategies. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  
              Interest Rate Risk  
              The exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt obligations   and one variable rate operating lease  .  We have used interest rate swap agreements and forward swaps to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates.   We   enter into these arrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutions with whom we generally have other financial arrangements. We are exposed to credit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform on their obligations.   Following is a summary of our interest rate swaps agreements at September 30, 2016:  
             
              As of   September 30, 2016  ,   we   had $  842.0   million of variable rate debt obligations   and $8.6 million of a variable rate operating lease  . If LIBOR were to increase 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by   $  6.4   million   annually (after consideration of the effect of the above derivative contracts)  . Certain senior mortgages have an anticipated repayment date and a maturity date. If these senior mortgages are not repaid by the anticipated repayment date the interest rate on these mortgages would increase from the current fixed rate. We are using the anticipated repayment date for our maturity schedule.  
              Additionally, our insurance subsidiaries  fixed income investment portfolios expose   us   to interest rate risk. This interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates. As part of our insurance companies  asset and liability management, actuaries estimate the cash flow patterns of our existing liabilities to determine their duration. These outcomes are compared to the characteristics of the assets that are currently supporting these liabilities assisting management in determining an asset allocation strategy for future investments that management believes will mitigate the overall effect of interest rates.  
              Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  
              The exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our Canadian busi  ness. Approximately 4.8% and 4.9%   of our revenue was generated in Canada during the first   six months   of fiscal 201  7   and 201  6, respectively  . The result of a 10.0% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar would not be material to net income. We typically do not hedge any foreign currency risk since the exposure is not considered material.

Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  
              This Quarterly Report contains  forward-looking statements  regarding future events and our future results of operations.   We may make additional written or oral forward-looking statements from time to time in filings with the SEC or otherwise. We believe such forward-looking statements are within the meaning of the safe-harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, estimates of capital expenditures, plans for future operations, products or services, financing needs and plans  ,   our perceptions of our legal positions and pending litigation against us,   the adequacy of our   liquidity,   our   goals and strategies,   and   plans for new business,   our   access to capital and leasing markets  , the impact of our compliance with environmental laws and cleanup costs, projections of capital expenditures and our used vehicle disposition strategy, the sources and availability of funds for our rental equipment and self-storage expansion and replacement strategies and plans, our plan to expand our U-Haul storage affiliate program, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and business, the availability of alternative vehicle manufacturers, our estimates of the residual values of our equipment fleet, our plans with respect to off-balance sheet arrangements, our plans to continue to invest in the U-Box program, the impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes on our operations, the benefits of our captial structure, the sufficiency of our capital resources and the sufficiency of capital of our insurance subsidiaries   as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing. The words  believe,   expect,   anticipate,     plan,   may,   will,   could,     estimate,   project  and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made.  
              Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified. Factors that could significantly affect results include, without limitation,   the degree and nature of our competition; our leverage; general economic conditions; fluctuations in our costs to maintain and update our fleet and facilities; the limited number of manufacturers that supply our rental trucks; our ability to effectively hedge our variable interest rate debt; that we are controlled by a small contingent of stockholders; risks relating to our notes receivable from SAC Holding; fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality; changes in, and our compliance with, government regulations, particularly environmental regulations and regulations relating to motor carrier operations; our reliance on our third party dealer network; liability claims relating to our rental vehicles and equipment; our ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees; reliance on our automated systems and the internet; our insurance financial strength ratings; our ability to recover under reinsurance arrangements and other factors described     in Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this Quarterly Report or the other documents we file with the SEC  . The above factors, the following disclosures, as well as other statements in this   Quarterly R  eport and in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, could contribute to or cause such risks or uncertainties, or could cause our stock price to fluctuate dramatically. Consequently, the forward-looking statements should not be regarded as representations or warranties by   us   that such matters will be realized.   We   assume no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, unforeseen events, changed circumstances or otherwise  , except as required by law  .

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures  
                Attached as exhibits to this   Quarterly Report   are certifications of   our   Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief   Financial   Officer ( C  F  O ), which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. This  Controls and Procedures  section includes information concerning the controls and procedures evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented in   the section Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  .  
              Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
              Our   management, with the participation of the CEO and C  F  O, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of   our    disclosure controls and procedures  (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) ( Disclosure Controls ) as of the   end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter   covered by this   Quarterly Report  . Our Disclosure Controls are designed to reasonably   ensure   that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed   or submitted   under the Exchange Act, such as this   Quarterly Report  , is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our Disclosure Controls are also designed to reasonably   ensure   that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including   our   CEO and C  F  O, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and C  F  O have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this   Quarterly Report  , our Disclosure Controls were effective related to the above stated design purposes.  
              Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls  
              Our   management, including   our   CEO and C  F  O, does not expect that   our Disclosure Controls or   our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.  
              Change in Internal Control   O  ver Financial Reporting  
              There ha  s   not been any change in   our   internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) during the most recent  ly completed   fiscal quarter that ha  s   materially affected, or   is   reasonably likely to materially affect,   our   internal control over financial reporting.

PART II Other information  
               Item 1. Legal Proceedings   
                 The   information regarding our legal proceedings   in   Note   9  , Contingencies  ,   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   is incorporated by reference herein  .   
               Item 1A. Risk Factors   
                We refer you to documents filed by us with the SEC, specifically  Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016, which identify important risk factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. We also refer you to the factors and cautionary language set forth in the section entitled  Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. MD A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with such risks and other factors for a full understanding of our operations and financial conditions. The risks described in our Form 10-K and herein are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.   
              Below we set forth material updates to the risk factors contained in  Item 1A. Risk Factors  or our most recently filed Form 10-K:  
               A substantial amount of our shares   are   owned by a small contingent of stockholders.   
              As of September 30, 2016, Willow Grove Holdings LP, directly and through controlled entities, owns   8,307,584 shares of AMERCO common stock, and together with Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, owns 8,359,527 shares   (approximately 42.6%) of AMERCO common stock.      Accordingly,     Edward J. Shoen     and     Mark V. Shoen, brothers,     are in a position to significantly influence     our business and policies, including the approval of     certain     significant transactions, the election of the members of     our     Board     of Directors     and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that their     interests will not conflict with the interests     of our other stockholders.  
              In     addition, 1,207,930     shares (  approximately 6.2%) of AMERCO     common stock is owned     under our     Employee     Stock Ownership     Plan ( ESOP ).      Each ESOP   participant is entitled to vote the shares allocated to himself or herself in their discretion.      In the event an ESOP participant does not vote his or her shares, such shares shall be voted by the ESOP trustee, in the ESOP trustee s discretion.

EXHIBIT 31.1  
              Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) Certification  
              I, Edward J. Shoen, certify that:  
             
                  I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of AMERCO (the  Registrant   
                  Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;   
                  Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;  
                  The Registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Registrant and have:   

Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  
                  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  
                  Evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and  
                  Disclosed in this report any change in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the Registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and  

The Registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the Registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  

All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and   

Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
