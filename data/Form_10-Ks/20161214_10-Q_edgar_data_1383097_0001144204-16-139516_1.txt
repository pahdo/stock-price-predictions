CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this
 Form 10-Q ) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. Forward-looking statements are projections in respect of future events or our future financial performance. In some cases,
you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   would, 
 intend,   expect,   plan,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate, 
 predict,   potential  or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology
and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: our product line; our business plan; the enforceability of our intellectual
property rights; projections of market prices and costs; supply and demand for our products; future capital expenditures; our collaboration
with Dwyane Wade, relationships with retailers, wholesalers and other business partners; ability to add new customer accounts;
and future borrowings under the Joint Factoring Agreement with Wells Fargo. The material assumptions supporting these forward-looking
statements include, among other things: our ability to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms; timing and amount of
capital expenditures; the enforcement of our intellectual property rights; our ability to launch new product lines; retention of
skilled personnel; continuation of current tax and regulatory regimes; current exchange rates and interest rates; and general economic
and financial market conditions. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However,
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as
of the date when made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result
of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject
to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our
present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described under  Risk
Factors  and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). 

CERTAIN TERMS USED IN THIS FORM 10-Q  

Unless expressly indicated or the context
requires otherwise, the terms  Naked,  the  Company,   we,   us,  and  our 
in this document refer to Naked Brand Group Inc., a Nevada corporation, and, where appropriate, its wholly owned subsidiary. 

Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References
to  fiscal 2017,   fiscal 2016  and  fiscal 2015  represent the fiscal years ended January
31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. References to  2017  and  2016  represent the calendar years ending

1.    Nature of Business  

Naked Brand Group Inc. (the  Company ) is a manufacturer
and seller of direct and wholesale men s and women s undergarments and intimate apparel in the United States and Canada
to consumers and retailers through its wholly owned subsidiary, Naked Inc. ( Naked ). The Company currently operates
out of New York, United States of America. 

Effective August 10, 2015, the Company effected a reverse stock
split of its common stock on the basis of 1:40. As such, the Company s authorized capital was decreased from 450,000,000
shares of common stock to 11,250,000 shares of common stock and an aggregate of 53,278,818 shares of common stock issued and outstanding
were decreased to 1,331,977 shares of common stock. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements give retroactive
effect to such reverse stock split and all share and per share amounts have been adjusted accordingly. 

Effective August 11, 2016, the Company amended its articles
of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 11,250,000 to 18,000,000 and to provide authority
to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock. 

NASDAQ Status  

The Company's common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market
under the symbol NAKD. On September 23, 2016, the Company received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The
NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( NASDAQ ) notifying the Company that it no longer complies with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1)
due to the Company s failure to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders  equity (the  Minimum Stockholders 
Equity Requirement ) or any alternatives to such requirement as of July 31, 2016 and as of September 22, 2016. In response,
the Company submitted a compliance plan to NASDAQ.  The Company is working with NASDAQ to finalize such plan and undertake
steps to regain compliance. If NASDAQ accepts the Company s plan, NASDAQ may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days
from the date of the notice, or until March 22, 2017, to evidence compliance with the Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement.
If NASDAQ does not accept the Company s plan, the Company will have the right to appeal such decision to a NASDAQ hearings
panel. The stockholders  equity reported in these financial statements is $420,941. 

2.    Ability to Continue as a Going Concern    

These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP )
on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its obligations and
commitments in the normal course of operations. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown
and these interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the
carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

As of October 31, 2016, the Company had not yet achieved profitable
operations, had incurred a net loss of $8,204,475 and had an accumulated deficit of $54,585,555 and expects to incur significant
further losses in the development of its business, which casts substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. To remain a going concern, the Company will be required to obtain the necessary financing to pursue its plan
of operation. Management plans to obtain the necessary financing through the issuance of equity and/or debt. Should the Company
not be able to obtain this financing, it may need to substantially scale back operations or cease business. The consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

3.    Basis of Presentation    

Interim Financial Statements   

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared by management, without audit, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the
annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
In the opinion of management, the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading and the accompanying
financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for fair presentation
of statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Operating results for
the nine months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending January
31, 2017. 

The interim condensed consolidated balance sheet at January
31, 2016 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information
and footnotes required by GAAP. 

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the most recent audited financial statements of the Company included in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2016. 

Segment Reporting   

The Company used several factors in identifying and analyzing
reportable segments, including the basis of organization, such as differences in products and services, and geographical areas.
The Company s chief operating decision makers review financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes
of making operating decisions and assessing financing performance. Accordingly, the Company has determined that as of October 31,
2016 and 2015, there is only a single reportable operating segment. 

The Company operates in one industry, the manufacture and sale
of direct and wholesale undergarments. Revenues from external customers are all derived from customers located within North America
as follows: 

At October 31, 2016, the net book value of long-lived assets
all located within North America were as follows:

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   

In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-12,  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms
of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period  ( ASU 2014-12 ).
ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service
period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant
date fair value of the award. This update further clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which
it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the
period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The Company adopted this standard on February 1, 2016. The
adoption of this standard did not have any effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest
- Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ),
which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
from the debt liability rather than as an asset.  In addition, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,  Presentation
and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements: Amendments to SEC Paragraph Pursuant
to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting  ( ASU 2015-15 ), which permits entities to defer and present
debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as assets, and was adopted concurrently with ASU No. 2015-03.  The
Company adopted these standards on a retroactive basis on February 1, 2016. Adoption of these standards resulted in the reclassification
of $15,058 in deferred financing costs at January 31, 2016 from assets to a deduction from the related debt liability.

New Accounting Pronouncements   

Unless otherwise discussed, management believes the impact of
recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
upon adoption. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ). The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of
transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The premise of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue
to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 can be adopted by the Company either retrospectively
or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. On April 1, 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date
of the new revenue standard by one year. As a result, public entities would apply the new revenue standard to annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15
will explicitly require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote
disclosure in certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after
December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying
the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU 2015-11 ) which requires a company to change the measurement principal for inventory
measured using the FIFO or average cost method from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value.
Treatment of inventory valued under the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method is unchanged by this guidance. The new guidance
will be applied prospectively and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows. 

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,  Presentation
of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2015-15 ). Currently, there is no guidance in GAAP about management s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related
footnote disclosures. The amendments in this update provide that guidance. The amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the
timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as
a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically,
the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term  substantial doubt,  (2) require an evaluation every reporting
period, including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4)
require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5)
require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for
a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this
update are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the new guidance to determine the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company s results of operations,
cash flows and financial condition

3.    Basis of Presentation  (continued)   

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,
 Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 eliminates the requirement
to bifurcate deferred taxes between current and non-current on the balance sheet and requires that deferred tax liabilities and
assets be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for public entities in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments for ASU-2015-17 can be applied
retrospectively or prospectively and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material
impact for any period presented. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Recognition
and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ). ASU 2016-01 provides guidance that
addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This guidance will
be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

In March 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 was issued as part of the FASB s simplification initiative
and affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The amendments in this update cover such areas
as the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of
cash flows, an accounting policy election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still
qualify for equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
 The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows. 

In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases
 ( ASU 2016-02 ). The guidance would require lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities
with corresponding right of-use assets. The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or
after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated
financial statements. 

4.    Inventory    

Inventory of the Company consisted of the following at October
31, 2016 and January 31, 2016: 

Balances at October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016 are recorded
at historical cost, less amounts for potential declines in value. At October 31, 2016, management has recorded an allowance for
obsolescence of $503,000 (January 31, 2016: $390,000) to reduce inventory to its estimated net realizable value.

to such renewal, with thirty days  prior written notice. During the nine months ended October 31, 2016 the Company did not
renew the CBC Factoring Agreement with CBC. 

On June 14, 2016, the Company entered into
a Joint Factoring Agreement (the  Joint Factoring Agreement ) with Wells Fargo. The Joint Factoring Agreement with
Wells Fargo replaces the CBC Factoring Agreement, which was terminated effective on the same date.

Under the terms of the Joint Factoring
Agreement, the Company may assign eligible accounts receivable (the  Accounts ) to Wells Fargo in exchange for loans
and advances (each such loan or advance, an  Advance ) up to an aggregate amount (the  Borrowing Base )
not to exceed the lesser of (i) $6,000,000 or (ii) the sum of up to 80% of trade receivables deemed eligible by Wells Fargo plus
(A) the lesser of up to (x) 50% of the value, calculated at the lower of cost or market, of finished goods, warehoused inventory
deemed eligible by Wells Fargo or (y) $500,000, plus (B) the lesser of (x) up to 75% of marketable securities held in a blocked
security account, subject to an account control agreement in favor of Wells Fargo (the  Securities Account ); provided,

value of such securities for purposes of calculating the Borrowing Base will be $0 or (y) $200,000, less any reserves that Wells
Fargo may establish from time to time. 

In connection with Wells Fargo s
services under the Joint Factoring Agreement, Wells Fargo receives a commission equal to the Factoring Commission Percentage (as
defined in the Joint Factoring Agreement) multiplied by the gross invoice amount of each Account purchased, which is charged to
the Company s account on the date a related Advance is made. During the initial term of the Joint Factoring Agreement, Wells
Fargo will receive minimum commissions equal to $24,000, $36,000 and $50,000 during the first, second and third year, respectively.

renew, unless terminated at any time by Wells Fargo with thirty days  written notice, or by the Company prior to such renewal,
with sixty days  prior written notice. 

The Joint Factoring Agreement contains

or the occurrence of other specified events that constitute an event of default could result in the termination of the Joint Factoring
Agreement and/or the acceleration of the repayment obligations of the Company. The Joint Factoring Agreement contains provisions
relating to events of default that are customary for agreements of this type.

issued at the price per security (the  Conversion Price ) issued in such Qualified Financing (the  Qualified
Financing Securities ) and on the same terms and conditions that apply to the Qualified Financing Securities.

of $3,406,565 in stock based compensation expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting term of these options

The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date
of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions: 

(1)  As the Company has insufficient historical data
on which to estimate the expected term of the options, the Company has elected to apply the short-cut method to determine the expected
term under the guidance of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110. 

(2)  As the Company has insufficient historical data
on which to estimate expected future share price volatility, the Company has estimated expected share price volatility based on
the historical share price volatility of comparable entities.

the Company issued an aggregate of 479,757 warrants exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of $4.84 per share for a period
of seven years from the date of issuance, pursuant to negotiated consulting and endorsement agreements. The weighted average grant
date fair value of these warrants at issuance was $4.67 for an aggregate grant date fair value of $2,239,000, based on the Black-Scholes
option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions: expected term 7 years, expected volatility 158.04%, expected
dividend yield 0.00%, risk free interest rate 2.09%. Stock based compensation is being recorded in the financial statements over
the vesting term of three years from the date of grant. The Company recognized stock based compensation expense of $(2,149) and
$(207,551) during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2016, respectively (2015: $165,849 and $325,648, respectively) in
connection with warrants granted. 

Certain of the warrants granted during
the year ended January 31, 2016 become exercisable only under certain anti-dilution performance conditions contained in the warrant
agreement. The fair value of these warrants at issuance was calculated to be $168,500 based on the Black-Scholes option pricing
model using the following assumptions: expected term 7 years, expected volatility 153.00%, expected dividend yield 0.00%, risk
free interest rate 2.11%. No stock-based compensation has been recorded in the financial statements as none of the performance
conditions have been met.

i)  In accordance with a negotiated agreement, the Company is required to pay royalty fees based on the greater of a pre-determined
percentage of certain sales, not to exceed 10% of these net wholesale sales, as defined in such agreements, or a minimum annual
amount. Minimum royalty payments are being amortized to operations over the period for which royalties accrue under the terms of
the agreement. The Company may terminate the agreement in the event that the other party fails to perform any of the services required
to be performed under the agreement or breaches any of its other covenants or agreements set forth in the agreement.   

During the nine months ended

however as at October 31, 2016, the Company has not been provided a notice of default by the other party to the agreement. If the
other party provides such notice of default at a later date, this could affect the Company s ability to sell certain portions
of its inventory on hand at October 31, 2016 that are covered under the royalty agreement. 

During the three and nine months ended October 31,
2016, $75,000 and $225,000, respectively (2015: $Nil and $Nil, respectively), in royalties were amortized to operations.

(Note 10(ii)), convertible into common stock at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of a Nonqualified Financing (Note
10(ii)).

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

Overview   

We
are an apparel and lifestyle brand company that is currently focused on innerwear products for women and men. Under our flagship
brand name and registered trademark  Naked      , we design, manufacture
and sell men s and women s underwear, intimate apparel, loungewear and sleepwear through retail partners and direct
to consumer through our online retail store www.wearnaked.com. We have a growing retail footprint for our innerwear products in
premium department and specialty stores and internet retailers in North America, including accounts such as Nordstrom, Dillard s,
Bloomingdale s, Amazon.com, Soma, Saksfifthavenue.com, barenecessities.com and others.  

During the three months
ended October 31, 2016 our net sales increased by $233,746, or 73.6% over the same period in fiscal 2016. Net sales increased
primarily as a result of new department store accounts, including Bloomingdales, Dillards, Chicos, and Saks Fifth Avenue, which
was partially offset by lower sales from Nordstroms for the current period. During the three months ended October 31, 2016, sales
to department stores accounted for approximately 48% of total sales, as compared to 42% during the same period in fiscal 2016.
Sales of our women s products at new accounts have been strong, however these sales were offset by a decrease in our men s
sales from Nordstrom in the current period, as a result of a reduction by Nordstrom in replenishment orders aimed at reducing
overstocked inventory. 

We sell all our collections
through our ecommerce store (www.wearnaked.com), which sales channel saw an increase in net sales to approximately $99,586, or
18% of total net sales for the three-month period ended October 31, 2016, from $83,193, or 26% of total net sales for the same
period in fiscal 2016, an overall increase of approximately 20%. Our ecommerce sales increased to $264,577 for the nine-month
period ended October 31, 2016 from $175,256 for the same period in fiscal 2016, an increase of approximately 51%. The decrease
in ecommerce sales as a percentage of total sales is attributable to a larger increase in total department and retail store sales
in the third quarter ended October 31, 2016 compared to the comparative quarter, as a result of new department store accounts,
as described above. 

Sales to retail and specialty
store accounts constituted approximately 26% of sales in the current quarter, as compared to 16% in the comparative quarter. Total
sales to retail and specialty store sales increased by approximately 184% over the comparative quarter, due to the addition of
a new men s account, on a test basis. Although the new retail account was not successful, we expect to add new retail and
specialty store accounts as a result of the launch of our women s collections and expect sales of women s products
to continue to increase throughout the year as a result of the addition of new customer accounts as well as marketing and promotional
activities to support these channels, along with our direct ecommerce sales. 

During the quarter ended
October 31, 2016, we sold off approximately $25,000 in out of season and overstock inventory through off price sales channels.
Sales to these customers accounted for approximately 5% of total net sales during the three months ended October 31, 2016 and
2015. 

During the quarter ended
October 31, 2016, men s products constituted 51% of total sales and women s products constituted 49% of total sales.
Going forward, we expect the majority of our growth to be driven by our more recently launched women s collections, as we
anticipate that these products will become more widely distributed. In addition, the women s market is substantially larger
than the men s market. However, we also expect to continue to see stable growth in our men s products through our
sales and marketing initiatives. 

Our products are sold in North America; however,
we believe our products appeal to men and women around the globe. We are currently exploring international distribution relationships
for our Naked and Wade X Naked products and we anticipate that we will commence selling a limited number of products in markets
such as Europe, Asia, and Central and South America starting in Calendar 2017 .  

Our industry is subject to seasonality of buying,
which can affect revenue and cash flows. For men, there are generally two distinct buying seasons in the apparel industry: Fall/Winter
season, which falls into the third to fourth quarters of our fiscal year and Spring/Summer season, which falls into the first
to second quarters of our fiscal year, with some potential shipments at the last quarter. The women s apparel buying markets
are more frequent than men s although we may elect to focus only on two main buying markets as we do for men s products
in order to optimize design and production cycles. As a result of growth and changes to our business with the introductions of
a new product lines, the natural seasonality of our business had a reduced effect. Thus, historical quarterly operating trends
may not be indicative of future performance because of new product launches and continued early stage sales growth. 

During the three months ended October 31, 2016,
we launched our first collections of Wade X Naked, which became available for advance purchase during the quarter ended July 31,
2016. The Company started shipping these orders in September 2016 through its direct to consumer channels, and received an initial
order from Nordstrom. During the quarter ended October 31, 2016, we shipped over 2,400 units for net sales of approximately $27,000
from the Wade X Naked collection. 

In the future, we intend to expand the Naked
brand on our own and through licensing partnerships into other apparel and product categories that can exemplify the mission of
the brand, such as athleisure and activewear, swimwear, sportswear, hosiery, bedding and home products, and more. 

Results
of Operations   

THREE
Months Ended OCTOBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 
2015    

Revenues   

During the three months
ended October 31, 2016, our net sales increased by $233,746, or 73.6%, to $551,494 from $317,748 for the same period in fiscal
2016. Net sales increased as a result of approximately $176,000 in new department stores sales relating to the addition of Bloomingdales,
Saks Fifth Avenue, Chico s, and Dillard s. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in Nordstrom sales for
the three months ended October 31, 2016 of approximately $38,000 from the same period in fiscal 2016. 

Gross Margins   

For the nine-month
period ended October 31, 2016, we realized a gross margin of 8.2%, compared to 29.2% in the same period in fiscal 2016. The decrease
was primarily due to a large write down of overstocked men s inventory during our second fiscal quarter, reflected in cost
of sales. 

Operating Expenses   

There was an overall decrease
in general and administrative expenses of 25.7% for the quarter ended October 31, 2016, compared to the same period in fiscal
2016. This decrease is mainly attributable the decrease in professional fees as a result of financing related activities in the
comparative period, and the decrease in directors  fees as a result of stock based compensation related to stock option
awards issued in the comparative period. 

There were also decreases
in consulting, product development, warehouse management, travel, investor relations, and marketing as further explained below: 

Consulting fee expenses
decreased as a result of a recovery of stock option compensation charges recognized in the quarter ended October 31, 2016 for
stock options issued to non-employees, which are being re-measured at each reporting period in accordance with ASC 505-50,  Equity
Based Payments to Non-Employees , the value of which decreased during the quarter ended October 31, 2016. 

Our marketing expenses
decreased for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 as a result of the negotiation of vendor terms with our social media partner
and a decrease in marketing expenses for merchandising consulting, photoshoots, and promotional material from the comparative
period in connection with the launch of new collections. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in marketing expense
associated with our collaboration and endorsement agreement with Dwayne Wade, including advanced royalty charges. 

Product development costs
have decreased because the Company incurred higher product development costs in the comparative period, in connection with the
anticipated launch of our women s collections. 

Warehouse management expenses
decreased in the quarter ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016 as a result of the engagement of
a new third party warehouse, at a lower cost. 

The decrease in general and administrative
expenses described above were partially offset by an increase in rent expense. 

Rent expense increased
in the quarter ended October 31, 2016 as a result of an expanded team, compared to the same period in fiscal 2016, which warranted
increased occupancy costs due to month-to-month rent based on the number of desks occupied. 

Other income and expenses   

We incurred interest expenses
of $19,731 for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 as compared to $133,432 for the same period in fiscal 2016. This decrease in
interest is attributable to the conversion of long term debt in December 2015, in connection with the public offering of our common
stock. 

Financing and accretion charges were $805
for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 compared to $94,980 for the same period in fiscal 2016. Financing and accretion expenses
in the comparative period related mostly to the accretion of debt discounts associated with the long-term debt, which was converted
to shares of common stock in December 2015. 

Net loss and comprehensive loss   

Our net loss for the quarter ended October
31, 2016 was $2,362,600, or $(0.39) per share, as compared to a net loss of $3,533,421, or $(2.08) per share, for the quarter
ended October 31, 2015. The most significant factor for the decrease in net loss in the current period is a result of the decrease
in general and administrative expenses, as described above. The most significant factor for the decrease in net loss per share
is due to the increased number of shares outstanding compared to the comparative period, as a result of the public offering of
common stock and conversion of debt to common stock in December 2015. 

NINE
Months Ended OCTOBER 31, 2016  COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31,
2015    

Revenues   

During the nine months
ended October 31, 2016, our net sales increased by $353,975, or 38%, to $1,292,132 from $938,157 for the same period in fiscal
2016. Net sales increased significantly primarily as a result of our first shipments of women s sleepwear, loungewear, and
intimate apparel collections to select department store and specialty store accounts during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as
well as the addition of new department store accounts with Bloomingdales, Dillards, Chicos, and Saks Fifth Avenue during the nine
months ended October 31, 2016. These increases were partially offset by reduced sales to one of our key customers, Nordstrom,
as a result of a reduction by Nordstrom in replenishment orders aimed at reducing overstocked in-store inventory and a store closure
which resulted in a large return of merchandise. 

Gross Margins   

For the nine-month period ended October 31, 2016, we realized
a gross margin of 8.2%, compared to 29.2% in the same period in fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a large write down
of overstocked men s inventory during our second fiscal quarter, reflected in cost of sales. 

Operating Expenses   

There was an overall decrease
in general and administrative expenses of 5% for the nine months ended October 31, 2016, compared to the same period in fiscal
2016. This decrease is mostly attributable to a decrease in directors fees consisting entirely of non-cash charges, which decreased
in the current period as a result of the appointment of advisors in the comparative period, which resulted in greater associated
initial stock based compensation charges during the period. 

There were also decreases
in consulting, product development, professional fees, insurance, travel, and warehouse management as further explained below. 

Consulting fee expenses
decreased as a result of a recovery of stock option compensation charges recognized in the period ended October 31, 2016 for stock
options issued to non-employees, which are being re-measured at each reporting period in accordance with ASC 505-50,  Equity
Based Payments to Non-Employees , the value of which decreased during the period ended October 31, 2016. This was offset by
an increase in consulting fees for fees paid to a consulting firm which were previously part of salaries and wages. 

Product development costs
have decreased in the current period because the Company incurred higher product development costs in the comparative period in
connection with the launch of our women s collections. This decrease also relates to a recovery for non-employee stock based
compensation due to a reduction in share price during the current period. 

Professional fees decreased
in the current period as a result of significant new contracts and financing activities in the comparative period, as well as
a decrease in legal fees as a result of negotiations to set a monthly fee with legal counsel. 

Insurance expenses decreased
mostly due to a change in the way insurance was being expensed. In the comparative period, insurance expense was expensed when
paid and included the initial down payment on our D O policy in June 2015. In the current period, the policy was set up as
a prepaid and the financing payments are being applied against the payable. 

Decreases to travel expenses
for the period ended October 31, 2016 are as a result of a decrease in discretionary spending due to cash shortages as well as
a decrease in financing related travel. 

Warehouse management expenses
decreased in the nine months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016 as a result of the engagement
of a new third party warehouse, at a lower cost. 

The decrease in general
and administrative expenses described above were partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits, marketing, transfer
agent and filing fees, and rent. 

The increase in salaries
and benefits for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 due to increases in staffing in both the accounting/finance and sales
departments as well as an increase in stock based compensation charges as a result of a layoff which triggered the immediate vesting
of all unvested options. 

Our marketing expenses
increased significantly for the period ended October 31, 2016 as a result of the expenses associated with our collaboration and
endorsement agreement with Dwayne Wade, including advanced royalty charges which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016, photoshoots
and promotional materials. 

Filing fees have increased
as a result of the up listing of our common stock to NASDAQ from the OTC markets, which exchange carries a higher annual fee,
which amount is amortized over the related calendar year. 

Rent expense increased in the period ended
October 31, 2016 as a result of an expanded team which warranted increased occupancy, however office and miscellaneous charges
decreased as a result of the implementation of a fully integrated ERP system in the same period in fiscal 2016. 

Other income and expenses   

We incurred interest expenses
of $56,200 for the period ended October 31, 2016 as compared to $494,788 for the same period in fiscal 2016. This decrease in
interest is attributable to the conversion of long term debt, in connection with the public offering of our common stock in December
2015. 

Financing and accretion
charges were $16,196 for the period ended October 31, 2016 compared to $300,252 for the same period in fiscal 2016. Financing
and accretion expenses in the comparative period related mostly to the accretion of debt discounts associated with the long-term
debt, which was converted to shares of common stock in December 2015 in connection with the public offering of our common stock. 

During the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2015, in connection with a private placement offering, we issued convertible debentures and warrants, each of
which were convertible or exercisable into shares of our common stock. These embedded conversion features and warrants were subject
to a registration rights agreement which, as a result of the terms of such agreement, triggered the requirement to account for
these instruments as derivative financial instruments. As a result of the application of these accounting rules, which required
these derivative financial instruments to be carried at fair value, we recorded a mark to market gain of $708,900 during the period
ended October 31, 2015 in correlation with fluctuations in the price of our common stock. During the period ended October 31,
2015, we obtained a waiver from all of the holders of these instruments waiving certain registration obligations of our Company
and, as such, these instruments are no longer required to be accounted for in this manner and no such charges exist in the period
ended October 31, 2016. 

Net loss and comprehensive loss   

Our net loss for the nine months ended October
31, 2016 was $8,204,475, or $(1.35) per share, as compared to a net loss of $8,483,089, or $(6.51) per share, for the nine months
ended October 31, 2015. The most significant factor for the decrease in net loss in the current period is a result of the overall
lower operating loss due to a 5% decrease in general and administrative expenses. The most significant factor for the decrease
in net loss per share is due to the increased number of shares outstanding compared to the comparative period, as a result of
the public offering of common stock and conversion of debt to common stock in December 2015. 

Liquidity and FINANCIAL
CONDITION   

Liquidity  

Our cash requirements have been principally
to fund working capital needs, the development of new product lines and the procurement of inventory to support our growth. 

As of October 31, 2016, the Company had cash totaling $44,365.
The Company believes it does not have sufficient cash resources to fund its operations through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. 

In accordance with
the collaboration and endorsement agreement with Dwayne Wade, the Company is required to make quarterly payments for royalty fees
based on the greater of a pre-determined percentage of certain sales, or a minimum annual amount. During the nine months ended
October 31, 2016, the Company did not make all minimum royalty payments as they became due under the terms of the agreement, and
consequently has not fulfilled its obligations under the agreement. Accordingly, the other party to the agreement has the right
to cause the agreement to enter into default. If the other party provides such notice of default, this could affect the Company s
ability to sell certain portions of its Wade X Naked inventory on hand and on order at October 31, 2016. As at October 31, 2016,
the Company has not been provided a notice of default by the other party to the agreement, and is currently negotiating settlement
of amounts currently due under the agreement. No provision for any losses that might be incurred in the event of a notice of default
has been provided in the accompanying financial statements. 

The Company's common
stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol NAKD. On September 23, 2016, the Company received written notice
from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( NASDAQ ) notifying the Company that it no longer
complies with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to the Company s failure to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders 
equity (the  Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement ) or any alternatives to such requirement as of July 31,
2016, and as of September 22, 2016. In response, the Company submitted a compliance plan to NASDAQ.  The Company is working
with NASDAQ to finalize such plan and undertake steps to regain compliance. If NASDAQ accepts the Company s plan, NASDAQ
may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notice, or until March 22, 2017, to evidence compliance
with the Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement. If NASDAQ does not accept the Company s plan, the Company will have
the right to appeal such decision to a NASDAQ hearings panel. The stockholders  equity reported in this Form 10-Q is $420,941. 

Management intends to continue to raise funds
from equity and debt financings to fund our operations and objectives. However, we cannot be certain that financing will be available
on acceptable terms or available at all. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing debt or equity securities or
through bank financing, our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution. If we are unable to raise funds when required
or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly scale back, or discontinue, our operations. 

Factoring Arrangement with Wells Fargo   

On June 14, 2016, we entered
into a Joint Factoring Agreement (the  Joint Factoring Agreement ) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells
Fargo ). The Factoring Agreement with Wells Fargo replaces a factoring agreement with Capital Business Credit LLC, which
was terminated effective on the same date. 

Under the terms of the Joint Factoring Agreement,
we may assign eligible accounts receivable (the  Accounts ) to Wells Fargo in exchange for loans and advances (each
such loan or advance, an  Advance ) up to an aggregate amount (the  Borrowing Base ) not to exceed the
lesser of (i) $6,000,000 or (ii) the sum of up to 80% of trade receivables deemed eligible by Wells Fargo plus (A) the lesser
of up to (x) 50% of the value, calculated at the lower of cost or market, of finished goods, warehoused inventory deemed eligible
by Wells Fargo or (y) $500,000, plus (B) the lesser of (x) up to 75% of marketable securities held in a blocked security account,
subject to an account control agreement in favor of Wells Fargo (the  Securities Account ); provided, however, that
at any time when the market value of the securities held in such Securities Account is below $1,067,000, then the value of such
securities for purposes of calculating the Borrowing Base will be $0 or (y) $200,000, less any reserves that Wells Fargo may establish
from time to time. 

In connection with Wells
Fargo s services under the Joint Factoring Agreement, Wells Fargo receives a commission equal to the Factoring Commission
Percentage (as defined in the Joint Factoring Agreement) multiplied by the gross invoice amount of each Account purchased, which
is charged to the Company s account on the date a related Advance is made. During the initial term of the Joint Factoring
Agreement, Wells Fargo will receive minimum commissions equal to $24,000, $36,000 and $50,000 during the first, second and third
year, respectively. 

We bear the risk of credit
loss on the Accounts, except where Wells Fargo provides credit approval in writing on such Account. The Advances bear interest
on the daily net balance of any moneys owed at a rate of LIBOR plus 3%. All obligations under the Joint Factoring Agreement, including
the Advances (collectively, the  Obligations ), are payable on demand and may be charged by Wells Fargo to the Company s
account at any time. 

At October 31, 2016, there
was approximately $314,535 available for advance under the Joint Factoring Agreement. 

The Obligations are secured
by a continuing security interest in all assets, properties, and rights of the Company, wherever located, whether owned as of
the date of the Joint Factoring Agreement or subsequent thereto. The term of the Joint Factoring Agreement is for three years
and will automatically renew, unless terminated at any time by Wells Fargo with thirty days  written notice, or by us prior
to such renewal, with sixty days  prior written notice. 

Our decrease in working capital during the
period is primarily attributable to cash losses from operations. 

Cash Flows   

Operating Activities   

Cash flows used in our operating activities
was $4,116,570 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016, compared to $4,420,385 for the comparative period. The cash used in
operations during the period was largely the result of a net loss for the period, offset by non-cash charges of $4,053,388, mostly
related to share based compensation charges as described above. 

Investing Activities   

Investing activities used cash of $7,779 for
the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and used cash of $36,594 for the nine months ended October 31, 2015. Investing activities
included cash outlays for patent and trademark acquisitions in both periods. 

Financing Activities   

Cash used in financing activities during the
nine months ended October 31, 2016 was $612,280, which included $600,000 for the repayment of long term debt and $124,280 in net
repayments under factoring arrangements. 

Proceeds from financing activities during the
nine months ended October 31, 2015 included net advances of $580,407 made pursuant to the factoring arrangement and net proceeds
of $2,251,574 received in connection with the issuance of shares. 

Commitments and capital expenditures  

We do not anticipate that we will expend any
significant amount on capital expenditures like equipment over the next twelve months or enter into any other material commitments. 

Disclosure of Outstanding Share Data   

As of December 14, 2016, there were 6,069,982
shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. In addition, at December 14, 2016, the total dilutive securities outstanding,
including options, warrants and shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debt instruments was approximately 3,682,597 shares. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

Our interim condensed consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United
States ( GAAP ). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s
application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved
with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements. 

There have been no significant changes in the
critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2016 as
filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016. 

New Accounting Pronouncements   

For a description of new
applicable accounting pronouncements, see Note 3,  Basis of Presentation , of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We have no off-balance
sheet arrangements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
About Market Risk.  

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and are
not required to provide the information under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based
on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of October 31, 2016,
our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance
that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control  

There were no other changes in our internal
control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange
Act during the period covered by this Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures  

In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In
addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls
and procedures relative to their costs. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

We are not presently a party to any material
litigation, nor to the knowledge of management is any litigation threatened against us that may materially affect us. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

In addition to the information set forth in
this Form 10-Q, you should also carefully review and consider the risk factors contained in our other reports and periodic filings
with the SEC, including without limitation the risk factors contained under the caption  Item 1A Risk Factors 
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2016 that could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors discussed in that Form 10-K do not identify all risks that we
face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we
currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Except as provided below, there have been no material changes in the significant
factors that may affect our business and operations as described in  Item 1A Risk Factors  of the Annual Report
on 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2016, as amended, which was subsequently updated by  Item 1A Risk Factors 
of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2016. 

If we are unable to obtain additional
financing on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our growth or cease our development plans and operations.   

The operation of our business and our growth
efforts will require significant cash outlays. We are largely dependent on outside capital to implement our business plan and
support our operations. We anticipate for the foreseeable future that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will not
be sufficient to meet our cash requirements, and that we will need to raise additional capital through investments to fund our
operations and growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional working capital as needed on terms acceptable
to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise capital as needed, we may be required to reduce the scope of our growth efforts, which
could harm our business plans, financial condition and operating results, or cease our operations entirely, in which case, you
may lose all your investment. Financings, including future equity investments, if obtained, may be on terms that are dilutive
to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the price
at which you purchase your shares. 

As of October 31, 2016, the Company had cash
totaling $44,365. The Company believes that it does not have sufficient capital to fund its operations through the fourth quarter
ending January 31, 2017. 

Our Common Stock may be delisted from
The NASDAQ Capital Market if we cannot satisfy NASDAQ s continued listing requirements in the future.   

On September 23, 2016, we received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of NASDAQ notifying
us that we no longer comply with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to our failure to maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in stockholders 
equity (the  Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement ) or any alternatives to such requirement. In response,
we submitted a compliance plan to NASDAQ and are working with NASDAQ to finalize such plan and undertake steps to regain compliance.
If NASDAQ accepts our plan, NASDAQ may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notice, or until March
22, 2017, to evidence compliance with the Minimum Stockholders  Equity Requirement. If NASDAQ does not accept our plan, we
will have the right to appeal such decision to a NASDAQ hearings panel. The Company reported stockholders  equity of $420,941
in this Form 10-Q.  

If we are unable to comply with the Minimum
Stockholders  Equity Requirement and/or NASDAQ does not accept our compliance plan, our common stock may be delisted, which
could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity.
Without a NASDAQ listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our stock, the sale
or purchase of our stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock could decline. Delisting
from NASDAQ could also result in negative publicity and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. Further,
if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities.
These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our
common stock in the secondary market. If our common stock is delisted by NASDAQ, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an
over-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or
obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. We cannot assure you that our common stock, if delisted
from NASDAQ, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter quotation system. 

Investors should be aware that the value of
an investment in our company may go down as well as up. In addition, there can be no certainty that the market value of an investment
