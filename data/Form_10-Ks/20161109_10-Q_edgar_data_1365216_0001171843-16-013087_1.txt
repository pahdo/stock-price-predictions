1.      Business Organization and Basis of Presentation  

Description of the Business   

Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (Company) is
a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing, identifying, acquiring and bringing to market innovative medicines that
meet unmet medical needs. Our primary focus areas are gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and oncology-related disorders. 

The Company currently generates revenue mainly
from product sales, product royalties, upfront and milestone payments, and reimbursements for development activities. The Company
expects to continue to incur significant expenses for the next several years as the Company continues its research and development
activities, seeks additional regulatory approvals and additional indications for approved products and other compounds and seeks
strategic opportunities for in-licensing new products and product candidates. 

AMITIZA    (lubiprostone) is being
marketed for three gastrointestinal indications under the collaboration and license agreement (as amended in October 2014, the
North America Takeda Agreement) with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda). These indications are chronic idiopathic constipation
(CIC) in adults, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in adult women and opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults
suffering from chronic non-cancer related pain. Under the North America Takeda Agreement, the Company is primarily responsible
for clinical development activities, while Takeda is responsible for commercialization of AMITIZA in the United States (U.S.) and
Canada. The Company and Takeda initiated commercial sales of AMITIZA in the U.S. for the treatment of CIC in April 2006, for the
treatment of IBS-C in May 2008 and for the treatment of OIC in May 2013. Takeda is required to provide a minimum annual commercial
investment during the current term of the North America Takeda Agreement and may reduce the minimum annual commercial investment
when a generic equivalent enters the market. In October 2015, Health Canada approved AMITIZA for CIC in adults. In October 2014,
the Company and Takeda executed amendments to the North America Takeda Agreement, which, among other things, extended the term
of the North America Takeda Agreement beyond December 2020. During the extended term beginning in January 2021, Takeda and the
Company will share the annual net sales revenue of the branded AMITIZA products. The Company also partnered with Par Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (Par) and Dr. Reddy s Laboratories, Ltd. and certain of its affiliates (Dr. Reddy s) in connection with the settlement
of patent litigation in the U.S. related to our AMITIZA (lubiprostone) 8 mcg and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsule products. Under the
agreement with Par, the Company granted Par a non-exclusive license to market Par s generic version of lubiprostone 8 mcg
and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsules in the U.S. for the indications approved for AMITIZA beginning January 1, 2021, or earlier under
certain circumstances. Beginning on January 1, 2021, the Company and Par will split the gross profits of the licensed products
sold during the term of the agreement, which continues until each of the related patents has expired. Under the agreement with
Dr. Reddy s and certain of its affiliates,  the Company granted Dr. Reddy s a non-exclusive license to market Dr. Reddy s
generic version of lubiprostone 8 mcg and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsules in the U.S. for the indications approved for AMITIZA. This
license does not begin until more than six years from today s date, or earlier under certain circumstances. Dr. Reddy s
will pay to the Company a share of net profits of generic lubiprostone products sold during the term of the agreement, which decreases
over time and ends when all of the related patents have expired. In the event that either Par or Dr. Reddy s elect to launch
an authorized generic form of lubiprostone, the Company has agreed to supply such product    under
the terms of a manufacturing and supply agreement at a negotiated price. 

In Japan, AMITIZA is marketed under a license,
commercialization and supply agreement (the Japan Mylan Agreement) that was transferred to Mylan, Inc. (Mylan) from Abbott Laboratories,
Inc. (Abbott), as of February 2015, as part of Mylan s acquisition of a product portfolio from Abbott. The Company received
approval of its new drug application (NDA) for AMITIZA for the treatment of chronic constipation (CC), excluding constipation caused
by organic diseases, from Japan s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in June 2012 and pricing approval in November
2012. AMITIZA is Japan s only prescription medicine for CC. The Company did not experience any significant changes in the
commercialization of AMITIZA in Japan as a result of the transfer of the Japan Mylan Agreement from Abbott to Mylan. 

In May 2015, the Company entered into an exclusive
license, development, commercialization and supply agreement (the China Gloria Agreement) with Harbin Gloria Pharmaceuticals Co.,
Ltd. (Gloria), for AMITIZA in the People s Republic of China. Under the China Gloria Agreement, Gloria is responsible for
all development activities and costs, as well as commercialization and regulatory activities, for AMITIZA in the People s
Republic of China. The Company will be the exclusive supplier of AMITIZA to Gloria at an agreed upon supply price. Upon entering
into the China Gloria Agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $1.0 million. In June 2015, the China Food and Drug
Administration accepted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a pivotal trial of AMITIZA in patients with CIC; as a
result, the Company received an additional payment of $500,000 from Gloria. In addition to the $1.5 million in payments received
and recognized as revenue through June 2015, the Company is eligible to receive an additional payment for $1.5 million upon the
occurrence of a specified regulatory or commercial milestone event. 

In October 2014, the Company entered into an
exclusive license, development, commercialization and supply agreement (the Global Takeda Agreement) for lubiprostone with Takeda,
through which Takeda has the exclusive rights to further develop and commercialize AMITIZA in all global markets, except the U.S.,
Canada, Japan and the People s Republic of China. Takeda became the marketing authorization holder in Switzerland in April
2015 and in the United Kingdom (U.K.), Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Spain during 2016, and is
expected to become the marketing authorization holder in Italy in the last quarter of 2016. 

Before the execution of the Global Takeda Agreement,
the Company retained full rights to develop and commercialize AMITIZA for the rest of the world s markets outside of the
U.S., Canada and Japan. In the U.K., the Company received approval in September 2012 from the Medicines and Healthcare Products
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for the use of AMITIZA to treat CIC. The Company made AMITIZA available in the U.K. in the fourth quarter
of 2013. In July 2014, National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published the technology appraisal guidance recommending
the use of AMITIZA in the treatment of CIC and associated symptoms in adults who have failed laxatives. In January 2015, the Company
successfully completed the European mutual recognition procedure (MRP) for AMITIZA for the treatment of CIC in select European
countries, resulting in marketing authorizations in these countries. 

In Switzerland, AMITIZA was approved to treat
CIC in 2009. In 2012, the Company reached an agreement with the Bundesamt fur Gesundheit, (BAG), the Federal Office of Public Health
in Switzerland, on a reimbursement price for AMITIZA in Switzerland, and began active marketing in the first quarter of 2013. In
February 2014, the Company announced that the BAG revised several reimbursement limitations with which AMITIZA was first approved
for reimbursement and inclusion in the Spezialit tenliste (SL) to allow all Swiss physicians to prescribe AMITIZA to patients
who have failed previous treatments with at least two laxatives over a nine-month period. In July 2014, AMITIZA was approved for
the treatment of OIC in chronic, non-cancer adult patients by the Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, and in
October 2015, the BAG added this indication to the SL. 

In October 2015, Takeda obtained approval of
the clinical trial application (CTA) for AMITIZA for the treatment of CIC and IBS-C in Russia that was submitted in June 2015.
In December 2015, a CTA was filed for AMITIZA for the treatment of CIC, IBS-C and OIC in Mexico and South Korea. Takeda initiated
phase 3 registration trials in Russia in March 2016 and in South Korea and Mexico in May 2016. An NDA for the treatment of CIC,
IBS-C, and OIC was submitted in Israel in June 2015 and approved in July 2016. An NDA for the same indications was submitted in
Kazakhstan in December 2015. Additional NDA submissions in 2016 are planned in various other markets. 

As part of the acquisition of R-Tech in October
2015, the Company acquired all rights to RESCULA, an ophthalmology product used to lower intraocular pressure. In the U.S., the
Company ceased marketing RESCULA in the fourth quarter of 2014 and no product was made available after the March 2015 expiration
date. In May 2015, the Company returned all licenses for unoprostone isopropyl to R-Tech. In June 2016, the Company completed the
withdrawal of the marketing authorization for RESCULA in the U.S. RESCULA is being commercialized by Santen Pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd in Japan, Dong-A Pharmaceutical, Co., Ltd in South Korea and Sinphar Pharmaceutical, Co., Ltd and Zuellig Pharma Inc. in Taiwan. 

The Company s other current clinical
development programs include the following: 

Lubiprostone Alternate Formulation   

 The Company has been developing an alternate
formulation of lubiprostone for both adult and pediatric patients who are unable to take or do not tolerate capsules and for naso-gastric
tube fed patients. Takeda has agreed to fund 100% of the costs, up to a cap, of this alternate formulation work and the Company
expects to initiate a phase 3 trial of the alternate formulation of lubiprostone in adults in the second half of 2016 and, if the
trial is successful, to file an NDA in the U.S. for the alternate formulation for adults in the second half of 2017. 

Lubiprostone for Pediatric Functional
Constipation   

 The phase 3 program required to support an
application for marketing authorization of lubiprostone for pediatric functional constipation comprises four clinical trials. The
first two trials, one of which was recently completed, test the soft gelatin capsule formulation of lubiprostone in patients 6
to 17 years of age. The first of these trials is a pivotal 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial which was initiated in
December 2013 and completed enrollment in April 2016. The second trial is a follow-on, long-term safety extension trial that was
initiated in March 2014. In early November, the Company announced that the phase 3 trial of AMITIZA in pediatric functional constipation
in children 6 to 17 years of age failed to achieve its primary endpoint of overall spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) response. The
trial achieved statistical significance for some secondary endpoints, notably overall SBM frequency, straining, and stool consistency.
In addition, in this study lubiprostone was well tolerated. The Company intends to review these results with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and other constituencies, and will announce next steps at the completion of this review. Additionally,
after consultations with the FDA to better determine the doses and endpoints that should be studied, the phase 3 trial for the
alternate formulation of lubiprostone described above will be followed in mid-2017 with a phase three program in children 6 months
to 6 years of age using the alternate formulation. Takeda has agreed to fund 67% of the costs, up to a cap, of this pediatric functional
constipation program. 

VAP-1 Inhibitor RTU-1096   

 RTU-1096 is an oral compound
recently under development for indications in auto-immune/inflammatory and immune-oncology diseases. In the first quarter of
2016, the Company completed a phase 1 trial in healthy individuals that evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of the
compound. No significant safety issues were reported during the seven-day study. There was evidence of inhibition of systemic
VAP-1 at all doses tested and the trial provided evidence of proof of mechanism .  However, based on further assessment
of the clinical data and on additional non-clinical data generated in the quarter, development of the compound has
been discontinued. 

VAP-1 Inhibitor RTU-009   

 RTU-009 is a pre-clinical stage, VAP-1
inhibitor that was planned to be studied in acute cerebral infarction. However, based on new non-clinical data and the
decision to discontinue the development of RTU-1096, the development pathway has been revised to target chronic inflammatory
conditions. The redirection of the RTU-009 program for chronic inflammatory conditions is in early preclinical development
and as such has no perceived value. However, if the compound meets additional pre-specified non-clinical development
goals the Company plans to complete IND-enabling studies and then determine how best to develop the molecule in the clinic. 

CPP-1X/Sulindac Combination Product   

 In January 2016, the Company entered into
an option and collaboration agreement under which Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPP) has granted the Company the
sole option to acquire an exclusive license to commercialize CPP-1X/sulindac combination product in North America. This
product is currently in a phase 3 clinical trial being conducted by CPP for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis
(FAP). Under the agreement with CPP, the Company has the exclusive option to license this product in North America. There are
currently no approved treatments for FAP. The ongoing phase 3 study is a 150-patient, three-arm, double-blind, randomized
trial of the combination agent and the single agent comparators. Enrollment in the study has completed, and results from a
Phase 3 futility analysis are expected to be available in the first half of  2017. The trial is expected to
conclude in 2018. More information regarding the Company s arrangement with CPP is set forth in note 19 below.	 

Cobiprostone   

 In April 2016, the Company discontinued the
development of cobiprostone for the treatment of proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-refractory non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) or symptomatic
gastroesophageal reflux disease (sGERD), based on its analysis of top-line data from a Phase 2a study. While cobiprostone was observed
to have significant benefit in some of the secondary parameters of this exploratory study, the trial did not meet its primary endpoints.
In July 2016, the Company discontinued the development of an oral spray formulation of cobiprostone for the prevention of oral
mucositis in patients that are undergoing radio chemotherapy for head and neck cancer, based on the results of a pre-specified
futility analysis of the Phase 2a study. The futility analysis indicated that the clinical benefit of cobiprostone was insufficient
to support continuation of the study. 

Basis of Presentation   

 The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
(GAAP) and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial information. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read
in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 included
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on March 11, 2016, as amended. The financial information
as of September 30, 2016 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is unaudited. The year-end condensed balance
sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In the opinion
of the Company s management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments or accruals, considered necessary
for a fair statement of the results of these interim periods have been included. The results of the Company s operations
for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for a
full fiscal year. 

The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Sucampo AG (SAG) based in Zug, Switzerland, through which
the Company conducts certain of its worldwide and European operations; Sucampo Pharma, LLC (SPL) based in Osaka, Japan, through
which the Company conducts its Asian operations; R-Tech Ueno, Ltd., based in Tokyo, Japan, through which the Company conducts manufacturing
and certain development operations; Sucampo Pharma Americas LLC (SPA), based in Rockville, Maryland, through which the Company
conducts its North American operations; and Sucampo Pharma Europe, Ltd. (SPE), based in Oxford, United Kingdom. All inter-company
balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

2.      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Restricted Cash    

 As of September 30,
2016, restricted cash consisted of $25.2 million primarily related to the Credit Facility (see note 14); these funds will be held
in a restricted account until at least $35 million of the Term Loans under the Credit Facility have been repaid or prepaid. 

As of December 31,
2015, restricted cash consisted of $25.0 million related to the Credit Facility and $17.7 million related to the payment of the
Ueno and Kuno Trust Notes (see note 13), which were settled on February 1, 2016, and $8.2 million related to the squeeze out of
non-tendering R-Tech shareholders (see note 4), which was settled in January 2016. 

Certain Risks, Concentrations and Uncertainties   

 Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and receivables.
The Company places its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash with highly rated financial institutions. As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately $1.8 million or 1.1%, and $5.9 million or 3.6%, respectively, of the Company s
cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were issued or insured by the United States government or other government agencies.
The Company has not experienced any losses on these accounts related to amounts in excess of insured limits. 

Revenues from Takeda, an unrelated party, accounted
for 65.7% and 66.3% of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and 65.6% and 60.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Accounts receivable, unbilled accounts
receivable and product royalties receivable from Takeda accounted for 82.6% and 78.1% of the Company s total accounts receivable,
unbilled accounts receivable and product royalties receivable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Revenues from another unrelated party, Mylan,
accounted for 30.1% and 30.8% of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and 29.6% and 36.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company depends significantly upon
collaborations with Takeda and Mylan, and its activities may be impacted if these relationships are disrupted. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

 The carrying values of the
Company s financial instruments approximate their fair values based on their short maturities, independent valuations
or internal assessments. The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash,
current and non-current investments, receivables, accounts payable, convertible notes receivable, collaboration obligation
and accrued expenses. The carrying amounts of the Credit Facility notes payable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
approximated fair value and are classified as a Level 2 instrument. 

Variable Interest Entities   

 The Company performs initial and on-going evaluations
of the entities with which it has variable interests, such as equity ownership, in order to identify entities (i) that do not have
sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support
or (ii) in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest. Such entities are classified
as variable interest entities (VIEs). If an entity is identified as a VIE, the Company performs an assessment to determine whether
the Company has both (i) the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and
(ii) have the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant
to the VIE. If both of these criteria are satisfied, the Company is identified as the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As of September
30, 2016, CPP, in which the Company held a variable interest, was determined to be a VIE. See note 19 for additional information. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

 In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative
guidance that sets forth a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with
customers. The guidance was originally scheduled to be effective for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting periods
within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, but in July 2015 the FASB voted to defer the effective date to December
15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original
effective date of December 15, 2016. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt
this guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its results of operations, financial position
and cash flows. 

In April
2015 , the FASB issued ASU Number 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation
of Debt Issuance Costs  (ASU 2015-03). ASU 2015-03 specifies that debt issuance costs related  to
a note shall be reported in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the face amount of the note. ASU 2015-03 is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2015-03 had
no effect on the Company s results of operations or liquidity.  

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , (ASU 2015-17). This new guidance requires businesses
to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets on their balance sheets as noncurrent. Under existing accounting, a business must
separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent. ASU 2015-17 was issued as a way to simplify the
way businesses classify deferred tax liabilities and assets on their balance sheets. Public companies must apply ASU 2015-17 to
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Companies must follow the requirements for interim periods within those fiscal
years, but early adoption at the beginning of an interim or annual period is allowed for all entities. The Company has elected
to early adopt the guidance and has applied the guidance on a prospective basis. The adoption had no impact on the Company s
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders  equity, and cash flows for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which requires that
most equity investments be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income (other than those
accounted for under equity method of accounting). This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its
consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  in which it provided new guidance related to accounting for leases. The new
standard requires the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and the disclosure
of key information about leasing arrangements. Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying
asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation. Both the asset and liability will initially be measured at
the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Subsequent measurement, including the presentation
of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either finance or an operating lease. Initial costs
directly attributable to negotiating and arranging the lease will be included in the asset. For leases with a term of 12 months
or less, a lessee can make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize an asset and corresponding
liability. Lessees will also be required to provide additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing
and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures are intended to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial
statements and provide additional information about the nature of an organizations' leasing activities. The new standard is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. In transition,
lessees are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective
approach. The transition guidance also provides specific guidance for sale and leaseback transactions, build-to-suit leases and
amounts previously recognized in accordance with the business combinations guidance for leases. The Company is currently evaluating
its expected adoption method and the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting , which requires all of
the tax effects related to share-based payments to be recorded through the income statement. The new guidance also removes the
requirement to delay recognition of a windfall tax benefit until it reduces current taxes payable; instead, it is required to be
recognized at the time of settlement, subject to normal valuation allowance considerations. This guidance is effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact
of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

3.      Net Income per Share  

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing
net income by the sum of the weighted average class A common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average common shares and potential dilutive common shares outstanding. 

The computation of net income per share for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is shown below: 

The following securities were excluded from
the computation of diluted net income per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

4.      Acquisition of R-Tech  

On October 20, 2015, the Company acquired approximately
98% of the outstanding shares of R-Tech Ueno, Ltd., a Japanese company (R-Tech). The Company acquired the remaining 2% of outstanding
shares of R-Tech through a squeeze-out process under Japanese law on December 8, 2015. The total consideration for the acquisition
was approximately $275 million. This transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, with the Company
as the acquirer. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of R-Tech were recorded as of the acquisition
date at their respective fair values, and combined with those of the Company. 

The final allocation of the purchase price
based upon estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows: 

The following unaudited pro forma information
is presented as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015, and combines the historical results of operations of the Company
and R-Tech for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

5.      Segment Information  

The Company has one operating segment, which
is the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. 

Summarized product category and geographic
information is shown in the tables below. 

Product Category Information   

 Revenues for product categories are attributed
based on the following categories. 

Product royalty revenue represents royalty
revenue earned on the net sales of AMITIZA in North America. Product sales revenue represents drug product net sales of AMITIZA
in North America, Japan and Europe and drug product net sales of RESCULA in Japan. Research and development revenue represents
funded development work primarily related to AMITIZA. Contract and collaboration revenue represents the amortization of up-front
payments under the North America Takeda Agreement and release of the collaboration obligation under the Global Takeda Agreement
(see note 15). 

Company revenues by product category for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

Geographical Information   

 Revenues are attributable to countries based
on the location of the customer. The Company operates a manufacturing facility in Japan that supplies products to customers as
well as the Company s subsidiaries in other countries. The sales from the manufacturing operations to other countries are
included in the net sales of the country in which the manufacturing location is based. The intersegment portions of such sales
are excluded to derive consolidated revenues. The Company s country of domicile is the United States. 

Company revenues by geographic location for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

The Company s long-lived assets by geographic
location where located on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows: 

6.      Fair Value measurements  

The Company performs fair value measurements
in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (FASB) guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures,
which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. A fair value hierarchy is established which requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Company classifies its investments into the following categories based
on the three levels of inputs used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 : quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities, 

  Level 2 : inputs other than Level 1 that
are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted
prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can
be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or 

  Level 3 : unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

The Company has elected the fair value option
on its investment in CPP; as such, it is measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value
of the convertible note is $5.2 million using level 3 inputs (see note 19) provided by a valuation specialist using unobservable
market level inputs and assumptions that include accrued interest and prepayment assumptions. The Company re-evaluates the fair
value on a quarterly basis. Changes in the fair value can result from adjustments to the market level inputs and assumptions. The
election was made upon the acquisition of the financial asset and cannot be revoked. The changes in fair value are recorded in
current earnings within Other Income. As of September 30, 2016, there were no changes in the fair value of the note recorded in
earnings related to the convertible note received from CPP. There were no other financial instruments measured at fair value on
a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016. 

7.      Restructuring  

In December 2015, the Company adopted a plan
to restructure certain of its operations and to consolidate certain functions in the Company s corporate headquarters located
in Rockville, Maryland and in the Company s Japanese subsidiaries. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded pretax charges of approximately $1.9 million in connection with these restructuring activities. The restructuring plan
primarily included headcount reductions in connection with the ongoing integration of R-Tech (see note 4). These costs are reflected
within operating expenses and are detailed below: 

As of September 30, 2016, a restructuring accrual
of $1.0 million for termination benefits was included in accrued liabilities. The following table summarizes the accrued restructuring
costs at September 30, 2016. 

The Company expects to record additional restructuring
charges in the final quarter of 2016 related to the ongoing integration of R-Tech. The Company
has incurred total restructuring charges under this plan of $2.9 million through September 30, 2016. 

8.      Inventory  

Inventories are valued under a weighted average
costing method and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process
and finished goods. The Company s inventories include the direct purchase cost of materials and supplies and manufacturing
overhead costs. In connection with the acquisition of R-Tech, all inventory held by R-Tech was stepped-up in fair value to $37.6
million as of the acquisition date. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the remaining balance of inventory step-up
was zero and $14.3 million, respectively. 

Inventory consisted of the following at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

9.      Intangible Assets  

Intangible assets by major class consisted
of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The changes in intangible assets for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
the Company discontinued its VAP-1 Inhibitor RTU-1096 development program and changed the indication for its VAP-1 Inhibitor RTU-009
program. The Company considered the discontinuance and change in indication as a potential indicator of impairment of the related
in-process research and development (IPR D) asset. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim assessment, and as a result,
recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, which represented the entire carrying
value of the IPR D asset. This charge is classified in the Company s statement of operations as impairment of in-process
research and development. 

10.      Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities  

Accrued expenses consisted of the following
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Other current liabilities consisted of the
following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Other liabilities consisted of the following
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

At December 31, 2015, deferred grants consisted
of a $9.3 million grant from the Japan Agency for Medical Research   Development (AMED), for use in developing unoprostone-related
medicine for Retinitis Pigmentosa (see below), and a $300,000 government grant from Montgomery County, Maryland related to the
move of the Company s headquarters. Both grants may have to be repaid if certain conditions are not met. 

Under its arrangement with AMED, R-Tech received
 1.05 billion to support the development of unoprostone. This grant would be repayable in full if R-Tech terminated the development
of unoprostone for commercial or other reasons, but only in part if such termination was due to scientific failure of the compound.
R-Tech discontinued the development of unoprostone in early 2016. At the time of the Company s acquisition of R-Tech, AMED s
position, on which we relied when accounting for this liability at the time of the R-Tech acquisition, was that the full amount
of the grant would be repayable by R-Tech because such termination was for convenience, rather than due to a scientific failure
of the compound. In September 2016, however, AMED agreed to waive the repayment of all but approximately  105 million (approximately
$1.0 million) of the grant, representing 10% of the funds received by R-Tech from AMED through the end of March 2014. The Company
recognized approximately $9.3 million in other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 because of this grant
forgiveness. 

12.      Commitments and Contingencies  

Operating Leases   

 The Company leases office space in the United
States, Switzerland and Japan under operating leases through 2027. Total future minimum, non-cancelable lease payments under operating
leases are as follows: 

Rent expense for all operating leases was $650,000
and $482,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $2.0 million and $1.1 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Numab Commitment   

 In July 2016, Numab repaid all outstanding
amounts under its loan from Zurcher Kantonalbank, which was guaranteed by the Company under the Numab Agreement (see note 13).
As a result, the Company s liability associated with the Numab Agreement guarantee has been released. 

13.      Related Party Transactions  

R-Tech Ueno, Ltd.   

 Before the R-Tech acquisition on October 20,
2015, R-Tech was a related party through common ownership. Prior to the R-Tech acquisition, the Company did not own manufacturing
facilities. Instead, the Company contracted with R-Tech as the sole manufacturer of the Company s products to produce AMITIZA
and RESCULA. The Company had entered into multiple exclusive supply arrangements with R-Tech and had granted to R-Tech the exclusive
right to manufacture and supply AMITIZA and other products and compounds to the Company to meet its commercial and clinical requirements. 

The Company received upfront, development
and milestone payments under these agreements totaling $9.0 million through October 20, 2015. The Company recorded the following
expenses under all of its agreements with R-Tech for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015: 

The Company recognized $356,000 and $829,000
of revenue relating to its agreements with R-Tech for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, which was
recorded as contract and collaboration revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income. 

Numab AG   

 In September 2011, the Company entered into
a loan guarantee and development agreement (the Numab Agreement) with Numab AG (Numab). Under the terms of the Numab Agreement,
the Company provided Numab with up to CHF 5.0 million as collateral and served as guarantor for a loan to Numab from a third party,
Zurcher Kantonalbank. Following the payment of the first success fee during the first quarter of 2013, this amount was reduced
to CHF 2.2 million, or approximately $2.2 million, as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, collateral of CHF 2.2 million
had been deposited by the Company and Numab had utilized CHF 1.5 million of its loan facility, or approximately $1.5 million. At
December 31, 2015, the Company had recorded a guarantee liability of $202,000 in collateral callable to meet a potential loan default
by Numab. 

In July 2016, Numab repaid all outstanding
amounts under its loan from Zurcher Kantonalbank, which was guaranteed by the Company under the Numab Agreement. As a result, the
Company s liability associated with the Numab Agreement guarantee has been released, and all deposited collateral returned. 

Subordinated Unsecured Promissory Notes   

 In connection with the SAG acquisition in 2010,
the Company issued subordinated unsecured promissory notes (Notes) to the Ueno Trust and Kuno Trust, former shareholders of SAG.
The Ueno Trust and Kuno Trust are considered related parties. Each of the Notes was issued with an initial principal balance of
approximately $25.9 million, or approximately $51.9 million in the aggregate. The interest rate for the Notes was the sum of the
London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 4.0%, and was reset on December 1, 2015 to 4.7%. On February 1, 2016, the Notes were
paid in full. 

14.      Credit Facility and Notes Payable  

On October 16, 2015, the Company entered into
a Credit Agreement (Credit Facility) with Jefferies Financing LLC. Term Loans under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company s
option, at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 7.25% or the Adjustable Base Rate plus 6.25%. The average interest rate on the notes
payable for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 was 8.43%. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit
Facility as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company s debt is subject
to the fair value disclosure requirements as discussed in note 2. The carrying amounts of the notes payable at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 approximated fair value and are classified as a Level 2 instrument. 

15.      Collaboration Obligation  

Due to the signing of the Global Takeda Agreement,
the Company received an upfront payment from Takeda of $14.0 million in 2014, of which the Company is obligated to reimburse Takeda
for the first $6.0 million in developmental expenses incurred by Takeda. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the collaboration
obligation was $1.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively.

below: 

A summary of employee restricted stock units
activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 under the Company s 2016 Plan is presented below: 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan   

 Under the Company s 2006 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, the Company received $46,262 and $36,324 upon employees  purchase of 4,932 and 2,502 shares of class A common
stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $174,572 and $74,414 upon employees  purchase
of 18,719 and 5,442 shares of class A common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income   

 The following table details the accumulated
other comprehensive income activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The provision for income taxes is based upon
the estimated annual effective tax rates for the year applied to the current period income before tax plus the tax effect of any
significant unusual items, discrete events or changes in tax law. The Company s operating subsidiaries are exposed to statutory
effective tax rates ranging from zero to approximately 40%. Fluctuations in the distribution of pre-tax income among the Company s
operating subsidiaries can lead to fluctuations of the effective tax rate in the condensed consolidated financial statements. In
the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the actual effective tax rates were 47.8% and 37.4%, respectively, and
for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the actual effective tax rates were 57.4% and 32.1%, respectively. 

The Company assesses uncertain tax positions
in accordance with ASC 740-10  Accounting for Uncertainties in Tax . As of September 30, 2016, the Company s net unrecognized
tax benefits totaled approximately $3.7 million. Of this balance, $1.8 million would favorably impact the Company s effective
tax rate in the periods if they are recognized. Management has not identified any material uncertain tax positions that are reasonably
likely to be released during the next 12 months due to lapse of statutes of limitations or settlements with tax authorities. 

The Company conducts business globally and,
as a result, files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S., Switzerland and Japan, as well as in various
other state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities
throughout the world. Currently tax years 2011 to 2015 remain open and subject to examination in the major tax jurisdictions in
which tax returns are filed. The tax years 2009-2011 were examined by the U.S. tax authorities and resulted in no tax adjustments. 

On January 9, 2016, the Company entered into
a Securities Purchase Agreement and an Option and Collaboration Agreement with Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals (CPP) for the
development and commercialization of CPP-1X/sulindac combination. 

The Company made a $5.0 million loan to CPP
in exchange for a convertible note. The convertible note bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum and matures on January 31,
2019 unless earlier converted or prepaid. The convertible note is automatically convertible into securities of CPP, subject to
certain limitations, in the event CPP consummates a future financing with aggregate proceeds at least $10.0 million, exclusive
of any investment by the Company, whether through a public offering or a private offering (a Qualified Financing). Depending on
the timing of the Qualified Financing, the convertible note will automatically convert into the same securities issued in the Qualified
Financing at a 10% to 20% discount to the lowest issuance price of the securities in the Qualified Financing. The Company has also
agreed to purchase up to $5.0 million of CPP s securities in any such Qualified Financing. 

Under the terms of an Option and Collaboration
Agreement, CPP granted the Company the sole option to acquire an exclusive license to commercialize CPP-1X/Sulindac combination
product in North America. This product is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis
(FAP). Target enrollment in the study was achieved in April 2016 and the trial is expected to conclude in 2018. The Company will
pay CPP an option fee of $7.5 million, payable in two tranches. The first tranche of $3.0 million was paid in January 2016 and
was recorded as research and development expense. The second tranche of $4.5 million is due upon achievement of certain results
of the ongoing feasibility study, which are expected in early 2017. CPP will complete the ongoing Phase 3 trial under the oversight
of a joint steering committee between CPP and the Company. Upon exercise of its exclusive option, the Company would negotiate an
exclusive license to develop and commercialize the product in North America for all indications. In connection with the exercise
of the option right, the subsequent execution of a license agreement and the development and commercialization of the product,
the Company would be obligated to pay CPP up to an aggregate of $190.0 million of specified clinical development and sales milestones.
Under the terms of the license, the Company and CPP would share equally in net profits from the sale of licensed products. 

The Company has elected the fair value option
on the convertible note received from CPP due to the nature of the financial characteristics of the investment. As of September
30, 2016, the fair value of the convertible note is $5.2 million using level 3 inputs. 

CPP is considered to be a VIE with respect
to the Company. It has been determined that the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact CPP s economic
performance is held by the board of directors of CPP. The Company does not have a representative on CPP s board and does
not have the right to appoint or elect such a representative. Therefore, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of CPP, and
the entity is not consolidated with the financial statements of the Company. The company s maximum exposure to loss as a
result of its involvement with CPP is $5.2 million as of September 30, 2016, which is the investment in the convertible security
of $5.2 million. As of June 30, 2016, CPP had total assets of $7.1 million and total liabilities of $20.5 million.

Overview  

Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (Company) is
a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing, identifying, acquiring and bringing to market innovative medicines that
meet unmet medical needs. Our primary focus areas are gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and oncology-related disorders. 

We currently generate revenue mainly from product
sales, product royalties, development milestone payments, and reimbursements for clinical development activities. We expect to
continue to incur significant expenses for the next several years as we continue our research and development activities, seek
additional regulatory approvals and additional indications for our approved products and other compounds and seek strategic opportunities
for in-licensing new products and product candidates. 

Our operations are conducted through subsidiaries
based in the United States (U.S.), Japan and Switzerland. We operate as one segment, which focuses on the development and commercialization
of pharmaceutical products. 

AMITIZA (lubiprostone)  

United States and Canada   

AMITIZA is marketed in the U.S. for three gastrointestinal
indications under a collaboration and license agreement (North America Takeda Agreement) with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited
(Takeda). These indications are chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C)
in adult women and opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults suffering from chronic non-cancer related pain. Under the North
America Takeda Agreement, we are primarily responsible for clinical development activities, while Takeda is responsible for commercialization
of AMITIZA in the U.S. and Canada. Takeda is required to provide a minimum annual commercial investment during the current term
of the North America Takeda Agreement and may reduce the minimum annual commercial investment when a generic equivalent enters
the market. In October 2015, Health Canada approved AMITIZA for CIC in adults. In October 2014, we signed an amendment (Takeda
Amendment) to the North America Takeda Agreement, which among other things, extended the term of the North America Takeda Agreement
beyond December 2020. During the extended term beginning in January 2021, we will share with Takeda the annual net sales revenue
on branded AMITIZA products. We have also partnered with Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Par) and Dr. Reddy s Laboratories, Ltd.
(Dr. Reddy s) in connection with the settlement of patent litigation in the U.S. related to our AMITIZA (lubiprostone) 8
mcg and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsule products. Under our agreement with Par, we granted Par a non-exclusive license to market Par s
generic version of lubiprostone 8 mcg and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsules in the U.S. for the indications approved for AMITIZA beginning
January 1, 2021, or earlier under certain circumstances. Beginning on January 1, 2021, Par will split with us the gross profits
of the licensed products sold during the term of the agreement, which continues until each of our related patents has expired.
Under our agreement with Dr. Reddy s, we granted Dr. Reddy s a non-exclusive license to market Dr. Reddy s generic
version of lubiprostone 8 mcg and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsules in the U.S. for the indications approved for AMITIZA. This license
does not begin until more than six years from today s date, or earlier under certain circumstances. Dr. Reddy s will
pay to us a share of net profits of generic lubiprostone products sold during the term of the agreement, which decreases over time
and ends when all of our related patents have expired. In the event that either Par or Dr. Reddy s elect to launch an authorized
generic form of lubiprostone, we have agreed to supply such product under the terms of a manufacturing and supply agreement at
a negotiated price. 

Japan   

 In Japan, AMITIZA is the only prescription
medicine for chronic constipation, excluding constipation caused by organic diseases, and is marketed under a license, commercialization
and supply agreement (Japan Mylan Agreement) originally entered into with Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (Abbott). In February 2015,
Mylan purchased Abbott s non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, as a result of which Mylan acquired
the rights to commercialize AMITIZA in Japan. We did not experience any significant changes in the commercialization of AMITIZA
in Japan as a result of the transfer of the Japan Mylan Agreement from Abbott to Mylan. 

People s Republic of China   

 In May 2015, we entered into an exclusive license,
development, commercialization and supply agreement (China Gloria Agreement) with Harbin Gloria Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Gloria)
for AMITIZA in the People s Republic of China. We will be the exclusive supplier of AMITIZA to Gloria at an agreed upon supply
price. Under the China Gloria Agreement, Gloria is responsible for all development activities and costs, as well as commercialization
and regulatory activities, for AMITIZA in the People s Republic of China. Upon entering into the China Gloria Agreement,
we received an upfront payment of $1.0 million. In June 2015, the China Food and Drug Administration accepted an Investigational
New Drug (IND) application for a pivotal trial of AMITIZA in patients with CIC, as a result of which we received an additional
payment of $500,000 from Gloria. In addition to the $1.5 million in payments received and recognized as revenue through June 2015,
we are eligible to receive an additional payment in the amount of $1.5 million upon the occurrence of a specified regulatory or
commercial milestone event. 

Other Global Markets   

 In October 2014, we entered into an exclusive
license, development, commercialization and supply agreement (Global Takeda Agreement) for lubiprostone with Takeda. Under the
Global Takeda Agreement, Takeda develops and markets AMITIZA globally except in the U.S., Canada, Japan and the People s
Republic of China. We supply Takeda with the clinical and commercial product at a negotiated price. Takeda currently markets AMITIZA
for CIC and OIC in Switzerland and currently markets AMITIZA for CIC in the U.K. Takeda became the marketing authorization holder
in Switzerland in April 2015, in the United Kingdom (U.K.), Austria, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg and Spain
during 2016, and is expected to become the marketing authorization holder in Italy during the last quarter of 2016 

Before the execution of the Global Takeda Agreement,
we retained full rights to develop and commercialize AMITIZA for the rest of the world s markets outside of the U.S., Canada
and Japan. In the U.K., we received approval in September 2012 from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency for
the use of AMITIZA to treat CIC. We made AMITIZA available in the U.K. in the fourth quarter of 2013. In July 2014, National Institute
of Health and Care Excellence published the technology appraisal guidance recommending the use of AMITIZA in the treatment of CIC
and associated symptoms in adults who have failed laxatives. In January 2015, we successfully completed the European mutual recognition
procedure for AMITIZA for the treatment of CIC in select European countries, resulting in marketing authorizations in these countries. 

In Switzerland, AMITIZA was approved to treat
CIC in 2009. In 2012, we reached an agreement with the Bundesamt fur Gesundheit, (BAG), the Federal Office of Public Health in
Switzerland, on a reimbursement price for AMITIZA in Switzerland, and began active marketing in the first quarter of 2013. In February
2014, the BAG revised several reimbursement limitations with which AMITIZA was first approved for reimbursement and inclusion in
the Spezialit tenliste (SL) to allow all Swiss physicians to prescribe AMITIZA to patients who have failed previous treatments
with at least two laxatives over a nine-month period. In July 2014, AMITIZA was approved for the treatment of OIC in chronic, non-cancer
adult patients by the Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, and in October 2015, the BAG added this indication
to the SL. 

In October 2015, Takeda obtained approval of
the clinical trial application (CTA) for AMITIZA for the treatment of CIC and IBS-C in Russia that was submitted in June 2015.
In December 2015, a CTA was filed for AMITIZA for the treatment of CIC, IBS-C and OIC in Mexico and South Korea. Takeda initiated
phase 3 registration trials in Russia in March 2016 and in South Korea and Mexico in May 2016. A new drug application (NDA) for
the treatment of CIC, IBS-C, and OIC was submitted in Israel in June 2015 and approved in July 2016, and an NDA for the same indications
was submitted in Kazakhstan in December 2015. Additional NDA submissions have been made in Singapore in May 2016, and South Africa
and Indonesia in June 2016; further submissions are planned in 2016 for Brazil, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and
the United Arab Emirates. 

RESCULA (unoprostone isopropyl)  

As part of the acquisition of R-Tech in October
2015, we acquired global rights to RESCULA, an ophthalmology product used to lower intraocular pressure. In the U.S., we ceased
marketing RESCULA in the fourth quarter of 2014 and no product was made available after the March 2015 expiration date. In May
2015, we returned all licenses for unoprostone isopropyl to R-Tech. In June 2016, we completed the withdrawal of the marketing
authorization for RESCULA in the U.S. RESCULA is being commercialized by Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd in Japan, Dong-A Pharmaceutical,
Co., Ltd in South Korea and Sinphar Pharmaceutical, Co., Ltd and Zuellig Pharma Inc. in Taiwan. 

Product Pipeline  

 The table below summarizes the development
status of our marketed products and key product candidates. The commercialization rights to lubiprostone have been licensed to
Takeda on a global basis other than Japan and the People s Republic of China, to Mylan for Japan, and to Gloria for the People s
Republic of China. Commercialization of each product candidate may occur after successful completion of clinical trials and approval
from competent regulatory agencies. For CPP-1X/sulindac, we have an option to acquire an exclusive license to commercialize in
North America.

Our Clinical Development Programs  

Lubiprostone  

Alternate Formulation  

 We are developing an alternate formulation
of lubiprostone for both adult and pediatric patients who are unable to take or do not tolerate capsules and for naso-gastric tube
fed patients. Takeda has agreed to fund 100% of the costs, up to a cap, of this alternate formulation work and we expect to initiate
a phase 3 trial of the alternate formulation of lubiprostone in adults in the second half of 2016 and, if the trial is successful,
to file an NDA in the U.S. for the alternate formulation for adults in the second half of 2017. 

Pediatric Functional Constipation  

 The phase 3 program required to support an
application for marketing authorization of lubiprostone for pediatric functional constipation comprises four clinical trials. The
first two trials, one of which was recently completed, test the soft gelatin capsule formulation of lubiprostone in patients 6
to 17 years of age. The first of these trials is a pivotal 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial which was initiated in
December 2013 and completed enrollment in April 2016. The second trial is a follow-on, long-term safety extension trial that was
initiated in March 2014. In early November, we announced that the phase 3 trial of AMITIZA in pediatric functional constipation
in children 6 to 17 years of age failed to achieve its primary endpoint of overall spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) response. The
trial achieved statistical significance for some secondary endpoints, notably overall SBM frequency, straining, and stool consistency.
In addition, in this study lubiprostone was well tolerated. We intend to review these results with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and other constituencies, and will announce next steps at the completion of this review. Additionally, after consultations
with the FDA to better determine the doses and endpoints that should be studied, the phase 3 trial for the alternate formulation
of lubiprostone described above will be followed in mid-2017 with a phase 3 program in patients 6 months to 6 years of age using
the alternate formulation. Takeda has agreed to fund 67% of the costs, up to a cap, of this pediatric functional constipation program. 

VAP-1 Inhibitors  

RTU-1096   

 RTU-1096 is an oral compound
recently under development for indications in auto-immune/inflammatory and immune-oncology diseases. In the first quarter of
2016, we completed a phase 1 trial in healthy individuals that evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of the compound. No
significant safety issues were reported during the seven-day study. There was evidence of inhibition of systemic VAP-1 at all
doses tested and the trial provided evidence of proof of mechanism. However, based on further assessment of the clinical
data and on additional non-clinical data generated in the quarter, development of the compound has been discontinued. 

RTU-009  

 RTU-009 is a pre-clinical stage, VAP-1
inhibitor that was planned to be studied in acute cerebral infarction. However, based on new non-clinical data and the
decision to discontinue the development of RTU-1096, the development pathway has been revised to target chronic inflammatory
conditions. The redirection of the RTU-009 program for chronic inflammatory conditions is in early preclinical development
and as such has no perceived value. However, if the compound meets additional pre-specified non-clinical development goals we
plan to complete IND-enabling studies and then determine how best to develop the molecule in the clinic. 

CPP- 1X/Sulindac Combination Product  

In January 2016,
 we entered into an option and collaboration agreement under which Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPP) has granted
us the sole option to acquire an exclusive license to commercialize CPP-1X/sulindac combination product in North America.  This
product is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial being conducted by CPP for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).
Under our agreement with CPP, we have the exclusive option to license this product for North America. There are currently no approved
treatments for FAP.  The ongoing Phase 3 study is a 150-patient, three-arm, double-blind, randomized trial of the combination
agent and the single agent comparators. Enrollment in the study has completed and the results from a Phase 3 futility analysis
are expected to be available in the first half of 2017. The trial is expected to conclude in 2018. More information
regarding our arrangement with CPP is set forth in Note 19 in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Cobiprostone  

In April 2016, we discontinued development
of cobiprostone for the treatment of proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-refractory non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) or symptomatic gastroesophageal
reflux disease (sGERD), based on our analysis of top-line data from a Phase 2a study. While cobiprostone was observed to have significant
benefit in some of the secondary parameters of this exploratory study, the trial did not meet its primary endpoints. In July 2016,
we discontinued the development of an oral spray formulation of cobiprostone for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients that
are undergoing radio chemotherapy for head and neck cancer, based on the results of a pre-specified futility analysis of the Phase
2a study. The futility analysis indicated that the clinical benefit of cobiprostone was insufficient to support continuation of
the study. 

Results of Operations  

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues   

 The following table summarizes our revenues
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Total revenues were $57.9 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $33.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $24.4
million or 73.0%. 

Product royalty revenue  

 Product royalty revenue primarily represents
royalty revenue earned on Takeda net sales of AMITIZA in North America and was $20.8 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $19.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1.4 million or 7.5%. The increase
was primarily due to higher Takeda reported AMITIZA net sales, which were driven by a mix of price and volume increases. 

Product sales revenue  

 Product sales revenue represents drug product
sales of AMITIZA in North America, Japan and Europe, and drug product sales of RESCULA in Japan. AMITIZA product sales revenue
was $29.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $10.3 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of $18.8 million or 183.2%. The increase was primarily due to a $10.9 million increase in AMITIZA sales in
North America as a result of the acquisition of R-Tech in October 2015, coupled with an increase in Mylan related product sales
in Japan. RESCULA product sales revenue was $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $736,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1.7 million or 229.1%. The increase was due to the acquisition of R-Tech
in October 2015 and resulting revenue from sales of RESCULA under the Japan Santen Agreement. 

Research and development revenue  

 Research and development revenue was $3.2 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of $0.5 million or 16.9%. The increase was due to increased activity on the advancement of pediatric and alternative formulation
studies in the third quarter of 2016 for which we receive reimbursement from Takeda. 

Contract and collaboration revenue  

 Contract and collaboration revenue was $2.4
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $384,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of $2.0 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher release of the collaboration obligation under the Global Takeda
Agreement in the third quarter of 2016. 

Costs of Goods Sold   

 Costs of goods sold were $15.6 million
for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $5.3 million for the same period in 2015, an increase of $10.3 million or 194.9%.
The increase was primarily due to  acquired intangible asset amortization of $6.7 million and the costs associated
with increased product sales. 

Research and Development Expenses   

 The following table summarizes our research
and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Total research and development expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $10.0 million compared to $8.4 million for the three months ended September 30,
2015, an increase of $1.6 million or 19.2%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to the ongoing AMITIZA
pediatric trials, the acquisition of R-Tech in October 2015 and the inclusion of the respective share of R-Tech s research
and development costs during the post-acquisition period. 

Impairment of In-Process Research and Development   

 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
the Company discontinued its VAP-1 Inhibitor RTU-1096 development program and changed the indication for its VAP-1 Inhibitor RTU-009
program. The Company considered the discontinuance and change in indication as a potential indicator of impairment of the related
in-process research and development (IPR D) asset. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim assessment, and as a result,
recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, which represented the entire carrying
value of the IPR D asset. This charge is classified in the Company s statement of operations as impairment of in-process
research and development. 

General and Administrative Expenses   

 The following table summarizes our general
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

General and administrative expenses were $11.1
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015,
an increase of $3.3 million or 42.7%. The increase was primarily due to legal costs associated with the settlement of the Dr. Reddy s
matter as described in Part II, Item 1 of this report, restructuring costs and R-Tech integration/opportunity costs in 2016. 

Selling and Marketing Expenses   

 Selling and marketing expenses were $696,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $385,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of $311,000 or 80.8%. The increase was the result of the inclusion of R-Tech RESCULA-related commercial activities in 2016, which
was partially offset by the elimination of RESCULA sales and marketing activities in the U.S. during the 2016 period. 

Non-Operating Income and Expense   

 The following table summarizes our non-operating
income and expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Interest expense was $5.9 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $243,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $5.7 million,
due to interest payable in connection with our Credit Facility that was entered into in October 2015. 

Other income, net was $8.1 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $87,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $8.0 million.
The increase was primarily attributable to the recognition of $9.3 million in other income from the forgiveness of the AMED grant,
partially offset by increases in unrealized and non-cash foreign exchange losses in 2016. 

Income Taxes   

 We recorded an income tax provision of $7.4
and $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The income tax provision for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 primarily pertains to the impact of Subpart F deemed dividend rules in the U.S. The tax provision for
the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily pertained to pre-tax profits generated by our U.S., Japanese and Swiss subsidiaries. 

The effective tax rate (ETR) for the third
quarter of 2016 was 47.8%, compared to 37.4% in the same period of 2015. The ETR for the quarter was based on a projection of the
full year rate. The increase in the ETR was due to the shifting of profits from lower tax jurisdictions to higher tax jurisdictions
and the impact of Subpart F deemed dividend rules in the U.S. 

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues   

 The following table summarizes our revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Total revenues were $157.0 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $97.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $59.2
million or 60.5%. 

Product royalty revenue  

 Product royalty revenue primarily represents
royalty revenue earned on Takeda net sales of AMITIZA in North America and was $56.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $51.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $5.0 million or 9.8%. The increase
was primarily due to higher Takeda reported AMITIZA net sales, which were driven by a mix of price and volume increases. 

Product sales revenue  

 AMITIZA product sales revenue was $79.3 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $35.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of $43.3 million or 120.6%. The increase was primarily due to a $32.0 million increase in AMITIZA sales in North America as a result
of the acquisition of R-Tech in October 2015, coupled with an increase in Mylan related product sales in Japan. RESCULA product
sales revenue was $7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $748,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of $6.5 million. The increase was due to the acquisition of R-Tech in October 2015 and resulting revenue
from sales of RESCULA under the Japan Santen Agreement. 

Research and development revenue  

 Research and development revenue was $10.0
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an
increase of $2.5 million or 33.5%. The increase was due to increased activity on the advancement of pediatric and alternative formulation
studies for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, for which we receive reimbursement from Takeda. 

Contract and collaboration revenue  

 Contract and collaboration revenue was $4.3
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an
increase of $1.8 million or 75.1%. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher release of the collaboration obligation
under the Global Takeda Agreement in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, partially offset by upfront and milestone payments
of $1.5 million recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 under the China Gloria Agreement. 

Costs of Goods Sold   

 Costs of goods sold were $59.3 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $18.7 million for the same period in 2015, an increase of $40.6 million
or 217.7%. The increase was primarily due to the amortization of the R-Tech inventory step up of $15.2 million and acquired intangible
asset amortization of $18.9 million. 

Research and Development Expenses   

 The following table summarizes our research
and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Total research and development expenses for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $35.6 million compared to $22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
an increase of $13.3 million or 59.7%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to the ongoing AMITIZA
pediatric trials, costs associated with the CPP option, and the inclusion of R-Tech s research and development costs during
the post-acquisition period. 

Impairment of In-Process Research and Development   

 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
the Company discontinued its VAP-1 Inhibitor RTU-1096 development program and changed the indication for its VAP-1 Inhibitor RTU-009
program. The Company considered the discontinuance and change in indication as a potential indicator of impairment of the related
in-process research and development (IPR D) asset. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim assessment, and as a result,
recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which represented the entire carrying
value of the IPR D asset. This charge is classified in the Company s statement of operations as impairment of in-process
research and development. 

General and Administrative Expenses   

 The following table summarizes our general
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

General and administrative expenses were $32.4
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $22.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an
increase of $10.0 million or 44.9%. The increase is primarily due to the legal costs associated with the settlement of the Dr.
Reddy s matter, the inclusion of R-Tech general and administrative expenses, restructuring costs and R-Tech opportunity/integration
costs in 2016. 

Selling and Marketing Expenses   

 Selling and marketing expenses were $2.1 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of $477,000 or 29.7%. The increase was the result of the inclusion of R-Tech RESCULA-related commercial activities in 2016, which
was partially offset by the elimination of RESCULA sales and marking activities in the U.S. during the 2016 period. 

Non-Operating Income and Expense   

 The following table summarizes our non-operating
income and expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Interest income was $67,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to $155,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $88,000 or 56.8%. 

Interest expense was $18.1 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $784,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $17.4 million,
due to interest payable in connection with our Credit Facility that was entered into in October 2015. 

Other income, net was $5.2 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $3.7
million, or 167.9%. The increase was primarily attributable to the recognition of $9.3 million in other income from the forgiveness
of the AMED grant, offset by increases in unrealized and non-cash foreign exchange losses in 2016. 

Income Taxes   

 We recorded an income tax provision of $4.3
million and $11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The tax provision for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 primarily pertains to the impact of Subpart F deemed dividend rules in the U.S. The tax provision for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily pertains to pre-tax profits generated by our U.S., Japanese and Swiss subsidiaries. 

The effective tax rate (ETR) for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 was 57.4%, compared to 32.1% in the same period of 2015. The ETR for the nine months was based on a projection
of the full year rate. The increase in the ETR was due to the shifting of profits from lower tax jurisdictions to higher tax jurisdictions
and the impact of Subpart F deemed dividend rules in the U.S. 

Reportable Operating Segments   

 We have one operating segment, which is the
development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Sources of Liquidity   

 We finance our operations principally
from cash generated from operations and our Credit Facility. From time to time, we have also received proceeds from the issuance
and sale of our class A common stock and through the exercise of employee stock options. Cash generated from operations is principally
derived from product sales, royalty payments, upfront and milestone payments, and research and development expense reimbursements
received from Takeda, Mylan and other parties. 

Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted
cash consist of the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Our cash and cash equivalents are deposited
in operating accounts and liquid investments with an original maturity at time of purchase of 90 days or less. 

As of September 30, 2016, our restricted cash
consisted primarily of $25.0 million held in a restricted cash account, which is required by the Credit Facility until at least
$35 million of the Term Loans have been repaid or prepaid. As of December 31, 2015, our restricted cash consisted primarily of
this $25.0 million related to the Credit Facility, and as part of the R-Tech acquisition, $17.7 million held in a restricted cash
account for payment of the Ueno and Kuno Trust Notes, and $8.2 million held in restricted cash related to the squeeze out of non-tendering
R-Tech shareholders. As of September 30, 2016, the Ueno and Kuno Trust Notes had been repaid and the R-Tech acquisition had been
completed. 

Cash Flows   

 The following table summarizes our cash flows
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016   

 Net cash provided by operating activities was
$30.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This was primarily due to net income of $3.2 million, adjustments to
reconcile net income to net cash consisting of depreciation and amortization of $37.9 million, unrealized currency translation
losses of $9.8 million, write down of in-process research and development of $7.3 million, and stock-based compensation expense
of $5.4 million, offset by a deferred tax provision decrease of $16.6 million and AMED deferred grant forgiveness of $9.3. Additional
cash provided by operating activities consisted of decreases in receivables of $5.5 million, and changes in other assets and liabilities,
net of $0.8 million. Partially offsetting these items were an increase in inventory of $2.0 million, increases in prepaid and income
taxes payable and receivable, net of $1.1 million, and decreases in payables of $10.7 million. 

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.8
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This was primarily due to the payment of the squeeze-out liability for non-tendering
R-Tech shareholders of $7.7 million, investment in a convertible note receivable of $5.0 million, purchases of property and equipment
of $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of $12.3 million. 

Net cash used in financing activities was $16.4
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This was primarily due to repayments of notes payable (net of restricted
cash) of $18.7 million, partially offset by the issuance of Class A common stock upon the exercise of options and the associated
windfall benefit together totaling $2.3 million. 

The effect of exchange rates on the cash balances
of currencies held in foreign denominations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was an increase of $8.1 million. 

Nine months Ended September 30, 2015   

 Net cash provided by operating activities of
$24.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to our net income of $23.2 million plus non-cash stock-based
compensation expense of $5.6 million, offset in part by a $2.0 million gain from the transfer and assignment of licensing rights
to R-Tech and an increase in deferred tax provision of $2.8 million. 

Net cash used in investing activities of $6.8
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to investment purchases of $39.8 million and purchases of
property and equipment of $2.0 million, offset in part by sales and maturities of investments totaling $32.5 million, proceeds
of $2.0 million from the transfer and assignment of licensing rights to R-Tech, and changes in restricted cash of $548,000. 

Net cash provided by financing activities of
$2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to proceeds from exercised stock options totaling $4.8
million, plus a non-cash windfall benefit from stock-based compensation of $1.6 million, offset in part by repayment of notes payable
totaling $4.1 million. 

The effect of exchange rates on the cash balances
of currencies held in foreign denominations for nine months ended September 30, 2015 was an increase of $50,000. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

 As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements, as such term is defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. 

Funding Requirements and Capital Resources   

 We may need substantial amounts of capital
to continue growing our business. We may require this capital, among other things, to fund: 

our share of the on-going development program of AMITIZA;   

research, development, manufacturing, regulatory and marketing efforts for our other products and
product candidates;   

the costs involved in obtaining and maintaining proprietary protection for our products, technology
and know-how, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;   

activities to resolve our ongoing legal matters     

any option and milestone payments under general option and licensing ventures, including our exclusive
option and collaboration agreement with CPP;   

other business development activities, including partnerships, alliances and investments in or
acquisitions of other businesses, products and technologies;   

the expansion of our commercialization activities including the purchase of inventory; and   

the payment of principal and interest under our loan obligations.   

The timing of these funding requirements is
difficult to predict due to many factors, including the outcomes of our preclinical and clinical research and development programs,
when those outcomes are determined, the timing of obtaining regulatory approvals, and the presence and status of competing products.
Our capital needs may exceed the capital available from our future operations, collaborative and licensing arrangements and existing
liquid assets. Our future capital requirements and liquidity will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 

the cost and time involved to pursue our research and development programs;   

our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and to enter into licensing agreements and
contractual arrangements with others; and   

any future change in our business strategy.   

To the extent that our capital resources may
be insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we may need to finance our future cash needs through at-the-market sales,
public or private equity offerings, further debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. 

At September 30, 2016, based upon our current
business plan, we believe our future cash flows from operating activities and our existing capital resources will be sufficient
to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months. 

Effects of Foreign Currency   

 We currently receive a portion of our revenue,
incur a portion of our operating expenses, and have assets and liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, the reporting
currency for our consolidated financial statements. As such, the results of our operations could be adversely affected by changes
in exchange rates due to transaction losses, which are recognized in the statement of operations, or translation losses, which
are recognized in comprehensive income. We currently do not hedge foreign exchange rate exposure via derivative instruments. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.   

Our market risks during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 have not materially changed from those discussed in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on March 11, 2016, as amended. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk    

 We are subject to foreign exchange risk for
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency risk arises from the fluctuation of foreign exchange
rates and the degree of volatility of these rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency transactions
via derivative instruments. 

Interest Rate Risk   

 Our exposure to market risks associated with
changes in interest rates relates to both (i) the amount of interest income earned on our investment portfolio, and (ii) the amount
of interest expense payable under our Credit Facility. These risks offset each other somewhat; for example, rising interest rates
would increase both the amounts earned on our investments and amounts due under our Credit Facility. 

With respect to our investments, our goal is
to ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We attempt
to mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities. A hypothetical one percentage point decline in interest rates
would not have materially affected the fair value of our interest-sensitive financial instruments as of September 30, 2016. 

Our notes payable bear interest at a variable
rate calculated by reference to the Federal Funds rate or LIBOR, at our option. A hypothetical one percentage point increase in
interest rates would have increased our interest payments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 by approximately
$589,000 and $1.8 million, respectively. 

We do not use derivative financial instruments
for trading or speculative purposes. However, we regularly invest excess cash in overnight repurchase agreements that are subject
to changes in short-term interest rates. We believe that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal. 

Credit Risk   

 Our exposure to credit risk generally consists
of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, investments and receivables. We place our cash, cash equivalents and restricted
cash with what we believe to be highly rated financial institutions and invest the excess cash in highly rated investments. Our
investment policy limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with
investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer. 

Our exposure to credit risk also extends to
strategic investments made as part of our ongoing business development activities, such as the investment of $5.0 million in CPP
in exchange for a convertible note made in January 2016. A more detailed discussion of this arrangement is set forth in  note
19 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
approximately 1.1% and 3.6%, respectively, of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments are issued or insured
by the federal government or government agencies. We have not experienced any losses on these accounts related to amounts in excess
of insured limits. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.   

a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

 Our management, under the supervision and with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2016. In designing and evaluating such controls, management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and
procedures relative to their costs. Based upon the evaluation we carried out, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance
that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the applicable rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

 We completed the R-Tech acquisition on October
20, 2015. Our management considers this transaction to be material to our consolidated financial statements and believes that the
internal controls and procedures of R-Tech have a material effect on our internal control over financial reporting. We are currently
in the process of incorporating the internal controls and procedures of R-Tech into our internal controls over financial reporting
and extending our compliance program under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to include R-Tech. 

Part II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.   

On October 3, 2014, we received a
Paragraph IV certification notice letter regarding an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) submitted to the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (the FDA) by Dr. Reddy s Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy s Laboratories, Inc. (collectively,
Dr. Reddy s), requesting approval to market, sell, and use a generic version of the 8 mcg and 24 mcg AMITIZA
(lubiprostone) soft gelatin capsule products. In its notice letter, Dr. Reddy s alleges that U.S. Patent Nos.
6,414,016; 6,583,174; 7,064,148; 7,417,067; 8,026,393; 8,071,613; 8,088,934; 8,097,649; 8,114,890; 8,338,639; 8,748,481;
8,779,187; 7,795,312; 8,097,653; and 8,389,542, which cover compositions, formulations and methods of using AMITIZA, are
invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Dr. Reddy s manufacture, use or sale of the product described in
its ANDA. The latest of such patents expires in 2027. On November 12, 2014, we, Takeda, and certain affiliates of Takeda
filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Dr. Reddy s
related to the ANDA previously filed by Dr. Reddy s and described above. The lawsuit claims infringement of 7 patents
that are listed in the FDA s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book), with
the latest expiring in 2027. Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the
Hatch-Waxman Act, as a result of the patent infringement lawsuit, final FDA approval of Dr. Reddy s ANDA will be stayed
up to 30 months from the date of receipt of the notice letter. On September 14, 2016, the parties to this lawsuit entered
into a Settlement and License Agreement and agreed to dismiss the suit by mutual consent. Under this agreement, we granted
Dr. Reddy s a non-exclusive license to market its generic version of lubiprostone 8 mcg and 24 mcg soft gelatin
capsules in the U.S. for the indications approved for AMITIZA. This license does not begin until more than six years from
today s date, or earlier under certain circumstances. Dr. Reddy s will pay to us a share of net profits of
generic lubiprostone products sold during the term of the agreement, which decreases over time and ends when all of our
related patents have expired. In the event Dr. Reddy s elects to launch an authorized generic form of lubiprostone, we
have agreed to supply such product under the terms of a manufacturing and supply agreement at a negotiated price.    

On May 27, 2015, R-Tech received a Paragraph
IV certification notice letter regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Apotex, Inc. requesting approval to market, sell, and
use a generic version of the RESCULA (unoprostone isopropyl ophthalmic solution) 0.15% product approved for the lowering of intraocular
pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In its notice letter, Par Pharmaceutical alleges that U.S.
Patent Nos. 6,458,836 and 6,770,675, which cover compositions, formulations and methods of using RESCULA, are invalid and/or will
not be infringed by Apotex s manufacture, use or sale of the product described in its ANDA. The latest of such patents expires
in 2020. On July 10, 2015, R-Tech filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against
Apotex related to the ANDA previously filed by Apotex and described above. The lawsuit claims infringement of two patents that
are listed in the FDA s Orange Book, with the latest expiring in 2020. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, as a result of the patent
infringement lawsuit, final FDA approval of Apotex s ANDA will be stayed up to 30 months from the date of receipt of the
notice letter. On September 10, 2015, Apotex filed an answer and counterclaim to our complaint. In May 2016, the parties negotiated
a settlement of the litigation, which was subsequently dismissed by mutual consent. The settlement agreement grants Apotex a license
to market its generic unoprostone product after a specified future date. 

On December 28, 2015, in connection with our
acquisition of R-Tech, three non-tendering stockholders of R-Tech submitted complaints to the Tokyo District Court alleging that
the purchase price of R-Tech s shares was unfair, and demanding an appraisal of the fair value of the shares. The number
of shares subject to these proceedings is minimal. As of the date of this filing, these proceedings remain ongoing. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.   

 Our business is subject to certain risks and
events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our
common stock. For a discussion of these risks, please refer to the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed by us with the SEC on March 11, 2016, as amended. There have not been any
material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

on behalf of corporations; 

WHEREAS , the Board of Directors of
the Company has determined that the ability to attract and retain such persons is in the best interests of the Company s

WHEREAS , it is reasonable, prudent
and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable

deemed to have been initiated by Indemnitee where Indemnitee seeks pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement to enforce Indemnitee s
rights under this Agreement. 

2.                  
   Term of Agreement . This Agreement shall continue until and terminate upon the later of: (a) 10 years after
the date that Indemnitee has ceased to serve as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or of any other

written request of the Company or (b) the final termination of all pending Proceedings in respect of which Indemnitee is granted
rights of indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section
9 of this Agreement relating thereto. In addition, no legal action shall be brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by
or in the right of the Company against Indemnitee, Indemnitee s estate, spouse, heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives
after the expiration of five (5) years from the date of accrual of such cause of action, and any claim or cause of action of the

period; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable to any such cause of action, such
shorter period shall govern.

Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Executive Indemnification Agreement      3   

4.                  
   Indemnification . 

(a)                
   In General . In connection with any Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify and advance Expenses to Indemnitee
as provided in this Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in effect on the date hereof and to such greater
extent as applicable law may thereafter from time to time permit. 

(b)               
   Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company . Indemnitee shall be entitled to the
rights of indemnification provided in this Section 4(b) if, by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, Indemnitee is, or
is threatened to be made, a party to any Proceeding, other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company. Indemnitee shall
be indemnified against Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlements actually and reasonably incurred by
Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee
acted in Good Faith including without limitation, any and all losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities, joint or several
(including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action,
suit, proceeding or any claim asserted) under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act of 1934 ) or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise or which
relate directly or indirectly to the registration, purchase, sale or ownership of any securities of the Company or to any fiduciary
obligation owed with respect thereto or as a direct or indirect result of any Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein
made by any stockholder of the Company against Indemnitee and arising out of or related to any round of financing of the Company
(including but not limited to Proceedings or any claims, issues or matters therein regarding non-participation, or non-pro rata
participation, in such round by such stockholder), or made by a third party against Indemnitee based on any misstatement or omission
of a material fact by the Company in violation of any duty of disclosure imposed on the Company by federal or state securities
or common laws. 

(c)                
   Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company . Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification
provided in this Section 4(c) if, by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, Indemnitee is or is threatened to be made a
party to any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor. Indemnitee shall be indemnified
against Expenses, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s
behalf in connection with such Proceeding if Indemnitee acted in Good Faith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such indemnification
shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter in such Proceeding as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be
liable to the Company if applicable law prohibits such indemnification;  provided ,  however , that, if applicable law
so permits, indemnification shall nevertheless be made by the Company in such event if and only to the extent that the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or the court in which such Proceeding shall have been brought or is pending, shall determine. 

Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Executive Indemnification Agreement      4   

(d)               
   Indemnification of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful . Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, a party to and is successful, on
the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law against all
Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s
behalf in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise,
as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the
maximum extent permitted by law, against all Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement, actually and
reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or
matter. For purposes of this Section 4(d) and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding
by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter, so long as
there has been no finding (either adjudicated or pursuant to Section 6) that Indemnitee did not act in Good Faith. 

(e)                
   Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent
that Indemnitee is, by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection therewith. 

(f)                
   Assumption of Defense and Settlement . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, with respect
to any such Proceeding as to which the Indemnitee gives notice to the Company of the commencement thereof: 

(1)               
  the Company will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense; 

(2)               
  the Company, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, shall be entitled to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnitee. If the Company assumes the defense of the Indemnitee, it shall notify the
Indemnitee, and after the Indemnitee receives such notice, the Company shall not be liable to the Indemnitee under this Agreement
for any Expenses incurred by the Indemnitee after the date such notice was received. The Indemnitee shall be entitled to employ
Indemnitee s own counsel at Indemnitee s own expense. Nevertheless, the Company shall pay for Indemnitee s own
counsel if (1) the Company agrees to do the same, (2) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict
of interest between the Company and the Indemnitee regarding the defense of such action, or (3) the Company shall not in fact have
employed counsel to assume the defense of the Proceeding. The Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding
brought by or on behalf of the Company or as to which the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict
of interest between the Company and the Indemnitee regarding the defense of such Proceeding; and 

Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Executive Indemnification Agreement      5   

(3)               
  the Company shall not be liable to the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any
Proceeding unless the Company consents to such settlement. The Company shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner that would
impose any penalty or limitation on the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee s written consent. Neither the Company nor the
Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement. 

(g)               
   Contribution . 

(1)               
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the indemnification provided for in this Section 4 for
any reason is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to Indemnitee in respect of any losses, claims, damages,
expenses or liabilities referred to therein, then the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee thereunder, shall contribute
to the amount paid or payable by Indemnitee as a result of such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities 

(A)             
  in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee; or 

(B)              
  if the allocation provided by clause (A) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (A) above but also the relative fault of the Company and Indemnitee
in connection with the action or inaction which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. 

(2)               
  In connection with the registration of the Company s securities, the relative benefits received by the Company
and Indemnitee shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions that the net proceeds from the offering (before deducting
expenses) received by the Company and Indemnitee, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the applicable prospectus,
bear to the aggregate public offering price of the securities so offered. The relative fault of the Company and Indemnitee shall
be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission
or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or Indemnitee and the parties 
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company
and Indemnitee agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4(g) were determined by pro
rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. 

Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Executive Indemnification Agreement      6   

(3)               
  In connection with the registration of the Company s securities, in no event shall Indemnitee be required to
contribute any amount under this Section 4(g) in excess of the lesser of: 

(A)             
  that proportion of the total of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities indemnified against equal to the proportion
of the total securities sold under such registration statement which is being sold by Indemnitee; or 

(B)              
  the proceeds received by Indemnitee from its sale of securities under such registration statement. 

(4)               
  Persons found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act of
1933) shall only be entitled to contribution from any person who was found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 

5.                  
   Exceptions  

Any other provision herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement: 

(a)                
   Claims Under Section 16(b) . To indemnify Indemnitee for expenses and the payment of profits arising from the
purchase and sale by Indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 or any similar successor
statute; or 

(b)               
   Unlawful Indemnification . To indemnify Indemnitee if a final decision by a court having jurisdiction in the
matter shall determine that such indemnification is not lawful. 

6.                  
   Advancement of Expenses . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in Section 7, the Company shall advance
all reasonable Expenses which, by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, were incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in
connection with any Proceeding, within 20 days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting
such advance or advances, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall reasonably
evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall be preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee
to repay any Expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses.
Any advance and undertakings to repay pursuant to this Section 6 shall be unsecured and interest free. 

7.                  
   Procedures for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification . 

(a)                
   Initial Request . To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a
written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and
is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary of the
Company shall promptly advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification. 

Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Executive Indemnification Agreement      7   

(b)               
   Method of Determination . A determination (if required by applicable law) with respect to Indemnitee s
entitlement to indemnification shall be made as follows: 

(1)               
  if a Change in Control has occurred, unless Indemnitee shall request in writing that such determination be made in
accordance with clause (2) of this Section 7(b), the determination shall be made by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to
the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; 

(2)               
  if a Change of Control has not occurred, the determination shall be made by the Board by a majority vote of Disinterested
Directors, even though less than a quorum. In the event that there are no Disinterested Directors or if such Disinterested Directors
so direct, the determination shall be made by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered
to Indemnitee. 

(c)                
   Selection, Payment, Discharge, of Independent Counsel . In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification
is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 7(b) of this Agreement, the Independent Counsel shall be selected, paid
and discharged in the following manner: 

(1)               
  If a Change of Control has not occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board, and the Company
shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising Indemnitee of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. 

(2)               
  If a Change of Control has occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall
request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event clause (1) of this Section 7(c) shall apply), and Indemnitee shall
give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. 

(3)               
  Following the initial selection described in clauses (1) and (2) of this Section 7(c), Indemnitee or the Company,
as the case may be, may, within seven days after such written notice of selection has been given, deliver to the other party a
written objection to such selection. Such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected
does not meet the requirements of  Independent Counsel  as defined in this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth
with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act
as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is made, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel
unless and until a court has determined that such objection is without merit. 

Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Executive Indemnification Agreement      8   

(4)               
  Either the Company or Indemnitee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction if the parties have been unable
to agree on the selection of Independent Counsel within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification
pursuant to Section 7(a) of this Agreement. Such petition may request a determination whether an objection to the party s
selection is without merit and/or seek the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such other
person as the Court shall designate. A person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 7(b) of this Agreement. 

(5)               
  The Company shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel incurred by such Independent
Counsel in connection with acting pursuant to this Agreement, and the Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses incident
to the procedures of this Section 7(c), regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel was selected or appointed. 

(6)               
  Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 9(c) of this Agreement, Independent
Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of
professional conduct then prevailing). 

(d)               
   Cooperation . Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect
to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement, including providing to such person, persons or entity
upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure
and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or expenses (including
attorneys  fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such
determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification)
and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom. 

(e)                
   Payment . If it is determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be
made within 10 days after such determination. 

8.                  
   Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings . 

(a)                
   Burden of Proof . In making a determination with respect to entitlement to Indemnification hereunder, the person
or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 7(a), and the Company shall have the burden
of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary
to that presumption. 

Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Executive Indemnification Agreement      9   

(b)               
   Effect of Other Proceedings . The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by
judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of  nolo contendere  or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption

that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 9

Agreement.

of or an award in arbitration to enforce Indemnitee s rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement,
Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company against, any and all expenses
(of the types described in the definition of Expenses in this Agreement) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in such
adjudication or arbitration, but only if Indemnitee prevails therein. If it shall be determined in such adjudication or arbitration
that Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses sought, the expenses
incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such adjudication or arbitration shall be appropriately prorated.

and amends, restates and supersedes the Employment Agreement between Sucampo and Executive dated March 3, 2014. 

A.                
  Employment and Duties.  

1.                  
 Sucampo shall employ Executive as Chief Executive Officer. While employed by Sucampo, Executive shall devote Executive s

any person or entity other than for Sucampo, unless approved in writing by the Chair or lead independent director of Sucampo s
Board of Directors. 

2.                  
 This Agreement shall be in effect for the one-year period following the first date on which both Executive and Sucampo have
signed the Agreement (the  Anniversary Date ). The Agreement will continue to renew on a year-to-year basis unless
either party ends the Executive s employment pursuant to Section H; or Sucampo delivers written notice to the Executive about
Sucampo s intent to renew the Agreement with specifically articulated changes at least 30 days before the Anniversary Date,
and then terminates the Agreement under Section N. 

B.   Compensation and Benefits.    

1.                  
  Base Salary . Sucampo shall pay Executive an annual base salary of Six Hundred Seventy One Thousand Five Hundred
Forty Five US dollars and Seventy Four Cents (US$671,545.74) in accordance with Sucampo s regular payroll cycle (the  Base
Salary ). The Base Salary shall be reviewed on an annual basis and may, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors,
be increased, but not decreased (unless either mutually agreed by Executive and Sucampo, or established as part of salary reductions
that apply equally to similarly situated officers as a percentage reduction in their salaries). 

2.                  
  Bonus . Executive shall be entitled to participate in Sucampo s annual incentive plan, as defined and modified
from time to time by Sucampo. The target bonus for Executive shall be 60% of Executive s Base Salary, in the sole discretion
of the Board of Directors. The annual bonus payable to Executive for any fiscal year shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum on
the date set forth in Sucampo s incentive plan in effect at the time of payment. Sucampo reserves the unilateral right to
modify the incentive plan and reserves the unilateral discretion to determine the amount of Executive s bonus, if any. Executive
agrees that such bonus is not  earned  until approved by the Board of Directors.

any of its employees, officers, directors, or agents shall have any obligation whatsoever to pay such taxes or to otherwise indemnify
or hold Executive harmless from any or all of such taxes. For purposes of IRC Section 409A, the right to a series of installment
payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. All compensation due to Executive shall
be paid subject to withholding by Sucampo to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

5.                  
  Participation in Benefits . Executive shall be entitled to participate in all Sucampo employee benefit plans or programs
offered to other Sucampo employees to the extent that Executive's position, tenure, salary, and other qualifications make Executive
eligible to participate in such plans. Sucampo reserves the unilateral right to adopt, continue, discontinue, amend, modify, reduce
or expand each and every employee benefit plan, program or other fringe benefit during any term of the Agreement. Participation
by Executive in any such plan, program or benefit shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations.

in its sole discretion. All reimbursements due under this Agreement shall be separately requested and paid not later than one year
after Executive incurs the underlying expense. 

7.                  
  Professional Organizations . During the Term, Sucampo shall reimburse Executive for the annual dues payable for membership
in professional societies associated with the Executive s job responsibilities or subject matters related to Sucampo s
interests. Sucampo shall only reimburse for a new membership if and after Sucampo has approved such membership.

has reason to know that the party who owns the information or has disclosed it intends or expects the secrecy of the type of information
comprising the Trade Secret to be maintained.

2.

or (b) specifically authorized by Sucampo in writing prior to such use or disclosure. Executive understands and agrees that this
restriction shall continue to apply after this Agreement terminates, regardless of the reason for such termination. Executive agrees

therefrom, to Sucampo for review, prior to publication, to ensure that Sucampo s position with respect to Confidential Information
is not adversely affected by publication disclosures.

 If Executive is required to disclose Confidential Information due to the issuance of a court order or other government process,
Executive shall (a) promptly, but in no event more than 72 hours after learning of such court order or other government process,
notify the Executive Vice President, Global Human Resources, IT and Strategy; (b) at Sucampo s expense, take all reasonable
necessary steps requested by Sucampo to defend against the enforcement of such court order or other government process, and permit

on any medium whatsoever, relating or pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the business of Sucampo, including without limitation

 Executive agrees that, while employed by Sucampo, Executive shall not directly or indirectly, use, or allow the use of,

Sucampo Property to Sucampo, permanently delete the Sucampo Property from the computer or device, and confirm these actions to
Sucampo in writing. 

6.

1.

or other intellectual property law, that Executive makes or conceives, alone or with others, during or outside of working matters,
during Executive s employment with Sucampo, that relates in any manner to the actual or demonstrably anticipated business,
research or development of Sucampo, or results from or is suggested by any task assigned to Executive or any work performed by

3.                  
 Executive hereby assigns to Sucampo and/or its nominees, all of Executive s right, title, and interest in such Protected
Property, and all of the Executive s right, title, and interest in any patents, copyrights, patent applications, software,
trademarks, or copyright applications based thereon. Executive agrees that all Protected Property subject to copyright protection
constitutes  work made for hire  under United States copyright laws (17 U.S.C.  101) and is owned exclusively Sucampo.
To the extent that title to any Protected Property subject to copyright protection does not constitute a  work for hire, 
and to the extent title to any other Protected Property does not, by operation of law or otherwise, vest in Sucampo, all right,
title, and interest therein, including, without limitation, all copyrights, patents and trade secrets, and all copyrightable or
patentable subject matter, are hereby irrevocably assigned to Sucampo. 

4.                  
 Executive shall, at the expense of and on behalf of Sucampo, do everything reasonably necessary for Sucampo to obtain, preserve,
and protect Sucampo's right, title and interest in and to such Protected Property, including preparing and signing all documents
Sucampo may deem necessary to obtain and maintain patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks and other rights
within the United States or anywhere in the world. This obligation binds Executive or Executive s legal representative and
continues despite the end of Executive s employment with Sucampo, subject to reasonable compensation by Sucampo for Executive s
time and expenses. Should Sucampo be unable, after reasonable effort, to obtain Executive s signature on any document necessary
to apply for or prosecute any of the above rights for any reason, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Sucampo
or its officers and agents as Executive s agent coupled with a power of attorney to act on Executive s behalf to do
everything necessary to accomplish the above.

on the invention during Executive s employment. To further comply with this notice requirement, Executive has provided Exhibit
1 to this Agreement, which includes a complete list and description of all Inventions, intellectual property and equipment located
at Sucampo that is owned directly or indirectly by Executive and which shall not be transferred to Sucampo pursuant to this Agreement.
Except for those items listed on Exhibit 1, Executive agrees that he or she shall not assert any rights under any intellectual
property as having been made or acquired by Executive prior to being employed by Sucampo. If Sucampo and Executive disagree about
whether an invention is appropriately listed on Exhibit 1, Executive and Sucampo agree to submit the matter to arbitration per
the terms of Section I below. 

E.   Non-Competition And Non-Solicitation.    

1.                  
 Executive agrees that, as a result of Executive s position with Sucampo and/or the unique skills Executive brings
to Sucampo, Sucampo has entrusted Executive with information and customer relationships that are valuable to Sucampo, and that
Sucampo has a legitimate interest in protecting. Accordingly, Executive agrees that, during the term of this Agreement and for
a period of twelve consecutive months following the end of that employment, absent the prior written, signed consent of the President
of Sucampo, Executive shall not directly or indirectly render services, advice or assistance similar to the services Executive
provided while employed by Sucampo, or involving the Executive s use of knowledge Executive gained while employed at Sucampo,
to any Conflicting Organization, in connection with any Conflicting Product.  Conflicting Organization  means any person,
entity or organization engaged in research on, or development, production, or marketing of, a Conflicting Product.  Conflicting
Product  means any product, method, process, system or service provided for commercial use or sale of any person or organization
other than Sucampo, that is the same, similar to, or interchangeable with a product, method, process, system, or service provided
for commercial use or sale or under development for commercial use or sale by Sucampo when this Agreement terminates, or about
which Executive developed Protected Property while employed by Sucampo. The foregoing restrictions shall not prevent Executive
from working for or performing services on behalf of any business or other entity that offers Conflicting Products if such business
or entity is also engaged in other lines of business and if Executive certifies to Sucampo before accepting such employment that
Executive's employment or services shall be restricted to such other lines of business, and Executive shall not directly or indirectly
be providing support, advice, instruction, direction or other guidance to lines of business providing a Conflicting Product. 

2.                  
 Executive agrees that, solely as a result of Executive s position and employment with Sucampo, Executive shall or
has come to know Confidential Information regarding some of Sucampo s employees, independent contractors and/or consultants.
Accordingly, both during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve consecutive months following the end of that employment,
Executive agrees to not directly or indirectly either on Executive s own account 

Executive s Initials 

6  

or on behalf of any person,
company, corporation, or other entity  induce, solicit, endeavor to entice or attempt to induce any Sucampo Employees
(as defined below) to: (a) leave employment with Sucampo; (b) supply any Sucampo Confidential Information to any third party
or entity; or (c) alter, sever, discontinue, or in any other way interfere with their relationship with Sucampo.
 Sucampo Employees  are Sucampo employees, independent contractors and consultants who Executive has come to know
as a result of Executive s employment with Sucampo, and with whom Executive had business communications at any time
during the last twenty-four months of the Term of this Agreement. 

3.                  
 Executive agrees that, solely as a result of Executive s position and employment with Sucampo, Executive shall or
has come to know some of Sucampo s clients and has access to Confidential Information related to them. Accordingly, both
during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve consecutive months following the end of such employment, Executive
agrees to not, directly or indirectly, induce, solicit, endeavor to entice or attempt to induce any Sucampo Client (as defined
below) to cease doing business with Sucampo, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such Sucampo Client and
Sucampo.  Sucampo Clients  are individuals or entities of any nature, with whom/which Executive had business-related
involvement on behalf of Sucampo at any time during the last twenty-four months of the Term of this Agreement.  Business-related
involvement  includes Executive s direct communication with the Sucampo client, and any direct or indirect involvement
in any aspect of developing the initial relationship and any direct or indirect involvement on behalf of Sucampo in any aspect
of Sucampo s relationship with the Sucampo Client. 

4.                  
 Executive acknowledges and agrees that Sucampo operates globally, and the products and services of Sucampo are or are intended
to be marketed to customers on a global basis. Executive further acknowledges and agrees to the reasonableness of the provisions
in this Section E and the adequacy of the consideration supporting these provisions. Executive also acknowledges and agrees that
the provisions of this Section E will not preclude Executive from becoming gainfully employed following termination of employment
with Sucampo. 

F.   Breach of Obligations of Confidentiality, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.    

1.                  
 Executive acknowledges that any threatened or actual breach of Section C or E of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm
to Sucampo, for which money damages would be inadequate to compensate Sucampo. Consequently, in the event of a breach or threatened
breach of Section C or E of this Agreement, Executive agrees that Sucampo shall be entitled to expedited arbitration under Section
I of this Agreement to obtain injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement, without necessity of posting a bond. In such an expedited
arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator must issue a determination within 30 days after Sucampo initiates the arbitration proceeding.
The twelve-month period described in Section E shall be tolled during any period when Executive is engaged in activity that violates
the terms of Section E. In such an arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall have the authority to award damages as appropriate.
However, given the difficulty of assessing damages for breaches of this Agreement, the Parties agree that, if the arbitrator finds
Executive violated this Agreement, the arbitrator must issue a damage award of, at minimum, $25,000. Each disclosure or transmission
of Protected Property shall constitute a separate violation and the minimum damage amount will apply to each violation. 

Executive s Initials 

7  

Further, if Executive breaches
or fails to honor any provision in Section C or E of this Agreement, and Sucampo is successful in whole or in part in any legal
or equitable action to defend its right under or to enforce any terms of Section C or E, Executive agrees to reimburse Sucampo
for Sucampo s costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys  fees associated with such action. In that event, the arbitrator
will be obligated to award Sucampo all its attorneys  fees and costs as part of the arbitrator s determination. Executive
waives any defense as to the validity of any liquidated damages stated in this Agreement on the grounds that such liquidated damages
are void as penalties or are not reasonably related to actual damages. 

2.                  
 Notwithstanding the language in Section F.1. above, under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall
not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that:
(a) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney;
and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made to Executive s
attorney in relation to a lawsuit for retaliation against Executive for reporting a suspected violation of law; or (c) is made
in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. 

G.   Sucampo Access.    

Executive
agrees and consents that, during the Term of this Agreement and thereafter, Sucampo may review, audit, intercept, review and disclose
all messages created, received or sent over the voice mail, electronic mail and Internet access systems provided by Sucampo, with
or without notice to Executive. Executive further consents and agrees that Sucampo may, at any time, access and review the contents
of all telephones and related systems, computers, computer disks, other data storage equipment and devices, files, desks, drawers,
closets, cabinets and work stations which are either on Sucampo s premises or which are owned or provided by Sucampo. Executive
acknowledges that Executive should have no expectation of privacy in any of the electronic communications systems or work areas
described in this paragraph. 

H.   Termination.    

1.                  
  Termination by Sucampo for Cause . Sucampo may terminate this Agreement and Executive s employment for Cause
(as defined below) by written notice with immediate effect. 

Cause  shall mean any of the following: 

(i)   
 the gross neglect, willful failure, or refusal of Executive to perform Executive's duties and/or responsibilities (other
than as a result of Executive's death or Disability); or 

(ii)   
 perpetration of an intentional and knowing fraud against or affecting the Company or any customer, supplier, client, agent
or employee thereof; or 

(iii)      
 any willful or intentional act that could reasonably be expected to injure the reputation, financial condition, business
or business relationships of the Company or Executive's reputation or business relationships, including but not limited to any
act that could subject Sucampo to legal liability (e.g. violation of Sucampo s policy prohibiting sexual harassment); or 

Executive s Initials 

8  

(iv)   
 conviction (including conviction on a  nolo contendere  plea) of a felony or any crime involving fraud, dishonesty
or moral turpitude; or 

(v) the material breach by Executive
of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section C or E); or 

(vi)     
 Executive s supervisor demonstrates he/she had  legitimate reasons  to conclude Executive failed or refused to
perform Executive s job duties and/or responsibilities at an acceptable level, within 30 days after Executive s supervisor
provided Executive with written notice detailing the specific (unacceptable) performance areas and/or behavior that Executive must
improve to remain employed; or 

(vii)     
 Executive refuses to execute a modified Agreement offered by Sucampo on the Anniversary Date of this Agreement that is in
compliance with Section A.2; as long as the modified Agreement does not make any unilateral changes to Section B.1 (protections
against deductions in the Executive s Base Salary), Section H (Termination for Cause/Termination Without Cause/Resignation
for Good Reason/Change of Control/Separation Benefits) or substantially change Section I (agreement to arbitrate). 

2.
  Termination Other Than For Cause  .  

a.                   
  Termination Without Cause . Either party may terminate this Agreement and Executive's employment hereunder at any
time upon 30 days  prior written notice to the other party. Executive s employment and this Agreement shall terminate
at the end of the 30-day notice period. Sucampo may elect to provide Executive with 30 days' salary in lieu of Executive's continued
active employment during the notice period. 

b.
                  
  Resignation for Good Reason  .  

i.                    
 To resign for Good Reason, within 21 days of any event or condition that gives rise to Executive s belief that he/she
has Good Reason to resign, Executive must notify Sucampo in writing that Executive intends to resign for  Good Reason under
Section H.2.b  and state the reasons for Executive s belief he/she has reason to do so. Following receipt of such notice,
Sucampo will have 30 days (the  Cure Period ) to cure the issues identified by Executive. If, by the expiration of
the Cure Period, Sucampo has not cured the issues identified by Executive, and those issues meet the standard for Good Reason defined
below, Executive may resign for Good Reason. If Executive does not resign within 14 days following the Cure Period, Executive waives
any future right to resign for Good Reason based on the same reasons set forth in his/her 21 day letter. 

ii.                  
 As used herein,  Good Reason  is the same standard as  constructive discharge  in Maryland federal
employment law cases. More specifically, to resign for Good Reason, Executive must establish that Sucampo unilaterally made materially
significant change(s) to, or diminutions of, Executive s work environment, commute to work, terms, conditions; job duties,
responsibilities and/or overall status of his/her position, that rendered Executive s continued employment so  unbearable
that a reasonable person would resign.  

Executive s Initials 

9  

iii.                
 Executive shall have the right to resign for Good Reason if Sucampo requires Executive to accept any unilateral change(s)
to Section A.2, Section B.1 (Base Salary), Section H (standards for termination/resignation/death and disability/separation benefits),
Section N (limits to unilateral changes), or any materially significant changes to Section I (Arbitration) of this Agreement at
any time including before, on or after the Anniversary Date. If Executive resigns under this subsection H.2.b.iii, Sucampo
shall pay Executive the Separation Benefits enumerated in Section H.2.d without any obligation to meet the constructive discharge
standard for Good Reason set forth above in Section H.2.b.ii. In addition, if Executive resigns because Sucampo or its successor
makes unilateral changes to this Agreement to prepare for or within 12 months following a Change in Control, that qualify
as Good Reason under this Section H.2.b.iii, Sucampo and/or its successor shall pay Executive the  Change in Control Benefits 
enumerated below in Section H.3.b  instead of  the Separation Benefits in Section H.2.d. 

iv.                  If
Executive provides notice that he/she is resigning for Good Reason, Sucampo reserves the right to accept
Executive s resignation immediately, end the Agreement, release Executive from employment immediately or at any time
during the Cure Period, and pay Executive s Base Salary during the remaining Cure Period, up to a maximum of 30
days. By electing to do so, Sucampo does not concede that Executive has met the condition(s) to resign for Good Reason
defined above. 

c.                   
  Death or Disability . If Executive dies, this Agreement and Executive's employment shall terminate automatically.
If Executive has or develops a disability that affects Executive s ability to work, Sucampo shall explore options with Executive
to determine whether Executive is able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.
In the event of any dispute as to whether Employee is disabled for purposes of this Section H.2.c., such dispute shall be resolved
by an independent physician competent to assess the condition at issue selected by Sucampo and performing such assessment at Sucampo s
expense. Upon termination of this Agreement due to Executive s death or disability, Sucampo shall provide Executive (or Executive s
estate, as applicable) with all of Executive s compensation and benefits that had fully accrued or fully vested as of the
date this Agreement terminated. No other compensation or benefits of any nature shall accrue, vest or continue after the effective
date the Agreement is terminated, except as provided under paragraph d. immediately below. 

d.                  
  Separation Benefits . If Sucampo terminates Executive s employment without meeting the conditions for  Termination
for Cause  in Section H.1; if Executive resigns for Good Reason under the conditions set forth in Section H.2.b, or due to
the Executive s  Death or Disability  under Section H.2.c; and Executive (or the executor of Executive s
estate upon death or incapacity) signs and returns to Sucampo without revocation a release prepared by Sucampo of all legally waivable
claims related to or arising from Executive s employment with Sucampo and all other terms determined exclusively by Sucampo,
then (i) Sucampo shall pay Executive (or the estate): (A) the amount of any COBRA continuation premium payments made by Executive
during the 12-month period following the date of termination, or the period ending when Executive becomes eligible for comparable
group medical benefits coverage from another source (whichever comes first); (B) a lump sum severance payment equal to the sum
of (1) twelve (12) months of Executive's then current annual Base Salary and (2) the current target 

Executive s Initials 

10  

bonus percentage of the current
annual Base Salary, to be made not later than 60 days following Executive s date of termination; and (ii) Executive s
Equity Incentive Awards shall vest as set forth in Section H.5 (collectively, the  Separation Benefits ). 

3.
  Termination in Connection with Change In Control.  

a.                   
 This Agreement terminates if it is not assumed by the successor corporation (or affiliate thereto) upon a Change in Control
(as defined below). 

Change
in Control  means: (i) the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of
the voting securities of Sucampo ; (ii) Sucampo is the non-surviving party in a merger; (iii) Sucampo sells all or substantially
all of its assets, provided, that no  Change in Control  shall be deemed to have occurred merely as the result of a
refinancing by Sucampo or as a result of Sucampo s insolvency or the appointment of a conservator; or (iv) the Board of Directors
of Sucampo, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that there has been a sufficient change in the share ownership or ownership
of the voting power of Sucampo s voting securities to constitute a change of effective ownership or control of Sucampo. 

b.                  
 If, in advance of the closing or within 12 months following the occurrence of a Change in Control of Sucampo, this Agreement
is terminated other than for Cause, and Executive signs and returns to Sucampo without revocation a release prepared by Sucampo
of all legally waivable claims related to or arising from Executive s employment with Sucampo and all other terms determined
exclusively by Sucampo, then (i) Sucampo shall pay Executive: (A) the amount of any COBRA continuation premium payments made by
Executive during the 24- month period following the Date of Termination, or the period ending when Executive becomes eligible for
comparable group medical benefits coverage from another source (whichever comes first) and (B) a lump sum payment equal to the
sum of (1) 24 months of Executive s then-current annual Base Salary and (2) 200% of the current target bonus percentage of
the Executive s current annual Base Salary, to be made not later than 60 days following Executive s date of termination;
and (ii) Executive s Equity Incentive Awards shall vest as set forth in Section H.5 (collectively, the  Change in Control
Benefits ). 

c.                   
 If within 12 months following a Change in Control, there is a material diminution of Executive s role in the company,
material diminution of status, or diminution of reporting structure, Executive shall have the right to resign and receive the Change
in Control Benefits enumerated in Section H.3.b. without being required to satisfy the standard for Good Reason defined in Section
H.2.b.ii. 

4.
  Timing Of Payments.  

a.                   
 Sucampo shall, only to the extent necessary, modify the timing of delivery of the Separation Benefits or the Change in Control
Benefits to Executive if Sucampo reasonably determines that the timing would subject such Benefit to any additional tax or interest
assessed under IRC Section 409A. In such event, the payments shall be made as soon as practicable without causing the Benefit to
trigger such additional tax or interest under Section 409A of the IRC. If any amount of the Benefit becomes constitutes  nonqualified
deferred compensation  within the meaning of Section 409A, payment of such amount shall not commence until 

Executive s Initials 

11  

Executive incurs a  separation
from service  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). If, at the time of Executive s separation
from service, Executive is a  specified employee  (under IRC Section 409A), any benefit as to which Section 409A penalties
could be assessed that becomes payable to Executive on account of Executive s  separation from service  (including
any amounts payable pursuant to the preceding sentence) shall be paid, without interest thereon, on the date six months and one
day after such separation from service. 

b.                  
 Prior to paying any Change in Control Benefit, Sucampo shall cause its independent auditors promptly to review, at Sucampo's
sole expense, the applicability to those payments of Sections 280G and 4999 of the IRC. If the auditors determine that any payment
of the Change in Control Benefit would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the IRC or any interest or penalties
with respect to such excise tax, then such payment owed to Executive shall be reduced by an amount calculated to provide to Executive
the maximum Change in Control Benefits which will not trigger application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the IRC, with any such reduction
being made last with respect to benefits that are not exempt from IRC  409A. 

5.
  Effect Of Termination On Equity Incentive Awards.  

a.                   
 If this Agreement is terminated other than by Sucampo for Cause, any unvested Equity Incentive Awards that have a duration
vesting condition as defined in the Stock Agreement shall immediately vest to the extent such unvested Equity Incentive Awards
would have vested in the 12 months from the date of termination; or 

b.                  
If Sucampo is acquired or is the non-surviving party in a merger, or Sucampo sells all of its assets, and in advance of
the closing of such transaction or within 12 months thereafter, this Agreement is terminated other than for Cause, any unvested
Equity Incentive Awards that have a duration vesting condition as defined in the Stock Agreement shall immediately vest and any
unvested Equity Incentive Awards with a performance condition shall immediately vest and may be exercised only to the extent the
performance targets have been achieved or would be achieved by such acquisition, merger or sale in accordance with the terms of
the Plan and the Stock Agreement. 

c.                  
If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with a provision of the Stock Agreement and/or the Plan, the provision more
favorable to the Executive shall govern. 

6.    No
Further Compensation . Executive shall receive all compensation and benefits provided to Executive by Sucampo that fully
accrued and fully vested before the date of termination of this Agreement. No other compensation or benefits of any
nature provided by Sucampo shall continue, accrue or vest after the date of termination, except as provided under the terms
of any Sucampo benefits plan in which Executive is enrolled as of the date of termination.

subject to mandatory binding pre- dispute arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, such as claims under the Dodd-Frank
Act. 

3.                  
 Executive agrees that, if Sucampo terminates the Agreement for Cause and an arbitrator later determines that Sucampo did
not have Cause to terminate the Agreement, then the remedy awarded to Executive shall be limited to such compensation and benefits
as Executive would have received in the event of Executive's termination other than for Cause at the same time as the original
termination. 

4.                  
 Executive affirms that Executive has been provided with a copy of Sucampo s Arbitration Procedures, and has had an
opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedures, to seek counsel, and has read, understands and accepts them. By signing
below, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that Sucampo has the unilateral right to amend its arbitration procedures from time
to time as long as the underlying procedures provide similar access to the arbitration process 

J.                  
   Executive s Representations .   Executive represents to Sucampo that Executive has no obligations to any
other person or entity that conflict with the Executive s obligations under this Agreement. Executive further represents
that, to the extent Executive has disclosed information to Sucampo, created any original materials or used any proprietary information

L.   Severability.    

If
any term of this Agreement is declared unenforceable, the decision-maker of competent jurisdiction shall interpret or modify this

 This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between the Parties concerning the topics addressed in this Agreement. This

inducements, agreements or understandings between the Parties regarding such topics. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of Sucampo, its successors and assigns, without the need for further agreement or consent by Executive. If Sucampo

shall not automatically be terminated, and Sucampo agrees to use its best efforts to ensure that the transferee or surviving company
shall assume and be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. The failure of either party to enforce any of the provisions in
this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of that party to enforce any such provision.

 During the term of this Agreement, the Agreement may not be modified, altered or changed, except through a writing signed

employ Executive at-will without an employment agreement, or either party may end Executive s employment under the terms
of Section H.

Exhibit 10.3  

AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT  

This Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement
(the  Agreement ) is made by and between Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., its parent, subsidiary, predecessor and affiliated
corporations (collectively  Sucampo ), and Peter Kiener ( Executive ), and amends, restates and supersedes
the Employment Agreement between Sucampo and Executive dated October 21, 2014. 

A.     Employment and Duties.  

1.                  
 Sucampo shall employ Executive as Chief Scientific Officer. While employed by Sucampo, Executive shall devote Executive s
full-time work efforts exclusively on behalf of Sucampo and shall not perform work of any nature for compensation of any kind for
any person or entity other than for Sucampo, unless approved in writing and signed by Sucampo s CEO. 

2.                  
 This Agreement shall be in effect for the one-year period following the first date on which both Executive and Sucampo have
signed the Agreement (the  Anniversary Date ). The Agreement will continue to renew on a year-to-year basis unless
either party ends the Executive s employment pursuant to Section H; or Sucampo delivers written notice to the Executive about
Sucampo s intent to renew the Agreement with specifically articulated changes at least 30 days before the Anniversary Date,
and then terminates the Agreement under Section N. 

B.     Compensation and Benefits.  

1.                     Base
Salary . Sucampo shall pay Executive an annual base salary of Four Hundred Eighteen Thousand Six Hundred Eighty Four US
dollars and Fifty Cents (US $418,684.50) in accordance with Sucampo s regular payroll cycle (the  Base
Salary ). The Base Salary shall be reviewed on an annual basis and may, in the sole discretion of the Board of
Directors, be increased, but not decreased (unless either mutually agreed by Executive and Sucampo, or established as part of
salary reductions that apply equally to similarly situated officers as a percentage reduction in their salaries). 

2.                  
  Bonus . Executive shall be entitled to participate in Sucampo s annual incentive plan, as defined and modified
from time to time by Sucampo. The target bonus for Executive shall be 40% of Executive s Base Salary, in the sole discretion
of the Board of Directors. The annual bonus payable to Executive for any fiscal year shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum on
the date set forth in Sucampo s incentive plan in effect at the time of payment. Sucampo reserves the unilateral right to
modify the incentive plan and reserves the unilateral discretion to determine the amount of Executive s bonus, if any. Executive
agrees that such bonus is not  earned  until approved by the Board of Directors. 

3.                     Stock .
At least annually for the Term of this Agreement, Executive shall be eligible for consideration to receive restricted stock
grants, stock options or other awards (collectively,  Equity Incentive Awards ) in accordance with the 2016
Equity Incentive Plan or such other equity incentive plan as may be designated in the Stock Agreement (collectively
referred to as the  Plan ). Any such Equity Incentive Awards shall be made in the sole discretion of the Board of
Directors. 

Executive s Initials  

4.                  
  Taxes . Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive shall be solely responsible for the satisfaction of any applicable
taxes that may arise pursuant to this Agreement (including taxes arising under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ),
which pertains to deferred compensation) or 4999 (which pertains to golden parachute excise taxes), and that neither Sucampo nor
any of its employees, officers, directors, or agents shall have any obligation whatsoever to pay such taxes or to otherwise indemnify
or hold Executive harmless from any or all of such taxes. For purposes of IRC Section 409A, the right to a series of installment
payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. All compensation due to Executive shall
be paid subject to withholding by Sucampo to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

5.                  
  Participation in Benefits . Executive shall be entitled to participate in all Sucampo employee benefit plans or programs
offered to other Sucampo employees to the extent that Executive's position, tenure, salary, and other qualifications make Executive
eligible to participate in such plans. Sucampo reserves the unilateral right to adopt, continue, discontinue, amend, modify, reduce
or expand each and every employee benefit plan, program or other fringe benefit during any term of the Agreement. Participation
by Executive in any such plan, program or benefit shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations. 

6.                  
  Expenses . Sucampo shall pay or reimburse Executive for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by Executive the performance of his or her obligations under this Agreement. Sucampo shall reimburse such expenses in accordance
with Sucampo s expense reimbursement policies and procedures. Sucampo reserves the right to modify such policies and procedures
in its sole discretion. All reimbursements due under this Agreement shall be separately requested and paid not later than one year
after Executive incurs the underlying expense. 

7.                  
  Professional Organizations . During the Term, Sucampo shall reimburse Executive for the annual dues payable for membership
in professional societies associated with the Executive s job responsibilities or subject matters related to Sucampo s
interests. Sucampo shall only reimburse for a new membership if and after Sucampo has approved such membership. 

C.     Confidential Information.  

1.                  
 Executive acknowledges that Sucampo operates in a competitive environment and has a legitimate business interest in protecting
Sucampo s Confidential Information and Protected Property.  Confidential Information  includes any of the following
information pertaining to Sucampo or its affiliated entities: 

Executive s Initials  

a.                     Any
and all information, whether or not meeting the legal definition of a trade secret, and whether in written, oral,
electronic or other form, containing and/or concerning: (i) business plans, strategic plans, forecasts, budgets, sales,
financial projections and costs; (ii) personnel and payroll records and employee lists, including any information related to
an employee s health; (iii) candidates, consultants, and contractors, including lists, resumes, preferences,
transaction histories and rates; (iv) customers and prospective customers, including their identity, the identities of their
employees, contractors and consultants, special needs, job orders, preferences, transaction histories, contacts,

research and development; (vi) business operations, internal organizational structure and financial affairs; (vii) pricing
structure and/or current or proposed manufacturing costs; (viii) proposed services, technologies and products; (ix) contracts
with customers, suppliers, joint ventures, licensors, licensees, or distributors; (x) customer history; (xi) compensation

b.                  
 Any information (including any compilation, device, method, technique or process) that (i) derives independent economic
value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons
who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances
to maintain its secrecy (hereafter  Trade Secret ). Such information constitutes a Trade Secret even if a person has
acquired the information without express notice that it is a Trade Secret if, under all the circumstances, such person knows or
has reason to know that the party who owns the information or has disclosed it intends or expects the secrecy of the type of information
comprising the Trade Secret to be maintained. 

c.                   
 The term  Confidential Information  excludes any information that (i) is, was, or enters in the public domain
without violation of this Agreement and through no fault of the Executive, (ii) was in Executive s possession free of any
obligation of confidence at the time it was disclosed to the Executive, or (iii) was rightfully communicated to the Executive by
a third party free of any obligation of confidentiality subsequent to the time it was disclosed by Sucampo to the Executive. 

2.                  
 During and after the Term of this Agreement, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, reproduce, commercialize, use,
disclose, or authorize use or disclosure of, any Confidential Information, unless such use or disclosure is (a) consistent with
Sucampo s obligations or business purposes and for the sole purpose of carrying out Executive s duties to Sucampo,
or (b) specifically authorized by Sucampo in writing prior to such use or disclosure. Executive understands and agrees that this
restriction shall continue to apply after this Agreement terminates, regardless of the reason for such termination. Executive agrees
to comply with all policies and procedures of Sucampo for protecting Confidential Information. 

3.                    Executive
agrees that Sucampo has the right to refuse publication of any papers prepared by Executive as a result of
Executive s employment, consultation, work or services, with, for, on behalf of or in conjunction with Sucampo.
Executive agrees to submit any proposed publications referring to Executive s employment, consultation, work, services
and activities with, for, on behalf of or in conjunction with Sucampo, or referring to any information developed therefrom,
to Sucampo for review, prior to publication, to ensure that Sucampo s position with respect to Confidential Information
is not adversely affected by publication disclosures. 

Executive s Initials  

4.                  
 If Executive is required to disclose Confidential Information due to the issuance of a court order or other government process,
Executive shall (a) promptly, but in no event more than 72 hours after learning of such court order or other government process,
notify the Executive Vice President, Global Human Resources, Information Technology and Strategy; (b) at Sucampo s expense,
take all reasonable necessary steps requested by Sucampo to defend against the enforcement of such court order or other government
process, and permit Sucampo to intervene and participate with counsel of its choice in any proceeding relating to the enforcement
thereof; and (c) if such compelled disclosure is required, Executive shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information
that is necessary to meet the minimum legal requirement imposed on Executive 

5.                  
 Executive agrees that, upon termination of this Agreement or if requested by Sucampo, Executive shall immediately return
to Sucampo any and all Sucampo Property (as defined below) and documents and other media containing Confidential Information (and
all hard/electric copies thereof) in Executive s possession, custody or control. 

a.                   
  Sucampo Property  shall mean any and all documents, instruments, records and databases, recorded or stored
on any medium whatsoever, relating or pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the business of Sucampo, including without limitation
any and all documents (and copies) containing or relating to Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that Sucampo Property
is solely the property of Sucampo regardless of whether it was created, stored or used on property of the Executive or any other
person or entity. 

b.                  
 Executive agrees that, while employed by Sucampo, Executive shall not directly or indirectly, use, or allow the use of,
Sucampo property of any kind (including property leased to Sucampo), for any purpose other than Sucampo activities, except with
the authorization of a duly authorized representative of Sucampo. 

c.                   
 Executive agrees not to remove any Sucampo Property from Sucampo s business premises or deliver any Sucampo Property
to any person or entity outside of Sucampo, except as required in connection with Executive s duties of employment. 

d.                  
 If Sucampo Property in electronic form that contains or relates to Confidential Information is stored on a computer or device
that is not Sucampo Property, then at the termination of this Agreement, Executive agrees to promptly deliver a copy of the stored
Sucampo Property to Sucampo, permanently delete the Sucampo Property from the computer or device, and confirm these actions to
Sucampo in writing. 

6.                    Executive
understands that Executive is signing this Agreement as a condition of Executive s employment, or continued employment,
with Sucampo. Executive further acknowledges and agrees that Executive s employment or continued employment by Sucampo,
Executive s access to Sucampo s Confidential Information, and other goods and valuable consideration
associated with employment by Sucampo, provide good and sufficient consideration for Executive s obligations under this
Agreement. 

Executive s Initials  

D.     Protected Property.  

1.                  
  Protected Property  includes any Invention (as defined below), discovery, improvement, idea or expression of
idea, process, development, design, know-how, data, and formula, whether patentable or un-patentable, or protectable by copyright
or other intellectual property law, that Executive makes or conceives, alone or with others, during or outside of working matters,
during Executive s employment with Sucampo, that relates in any manner to the actual or demonstrably anticipated business,
research or development of Sucampo, or results from or is suggested by any task assigned to Executive or any work performed by
Executive on behalf of Sucampo.  Invention  means any apparatus, biological processes, cell line, chemical compound,
creation, data, development, design, discovery, formula, idea, improvement, innovation, know-how, laboratory notebook, manuscript,
process or technique, whether or not patentable or protectable by copyright, or other intellectual property in any form. 

2.                  
 Executive agrees to communicate to Sucampo in writing as promptly and fully as practicable all Protected Property conceived
or reduced to practice by Executive at any time during the Executive s employment by Sucampo. Executive agrees to keep and
maintain adequate written records of Protected Property at all times and stages, in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, memoranda
and reports. Those records shall be the property of and be available to Sucampo at all times. 

3.                  
 Executive hereby assigns to Sucampo and/or its nominees, all of Executive s right, title, and interest in such Protected
Property, and all of the Executive s right, title, and interest in any patents, copyrights, patent applications, software,
trademarks, or copyright applications based thereon. Executive agrees that all Protected Property subject to copyright protection
constitutes  work made for hire  under United States copyright laws (17 U.S.C.  101) and is owned exclusively Sucampo.
To the extent that title to any Protected Property subject to copyright protection does not constitute a  work for hire, 
and to the extent title to any other Protected Property does not, by operation of law or otherwise, vest in Sucampo, all right,
title, and interest therein, including, without limitation, all copyrights, patents and trade secrets, and all copyrightable or
patentable subject matter, are hereby irrevocably assigned to Sucampo. 

4.                    Executive
shall, at the expense of and on behalf of Sucampo, do everything reasonably necessary for Sucampo to obtain, preserve, and
protect Sucampo's right, title and interest in and to such Protected Property, including preparing and signing all documents
Sucampo may deem necessary to obtain and maintain patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks and other
rights within the United States or anywhere in the world. This obligation binds Executive or Executive s legal
representative and continues despite the end of Executive s employment with Sucampo, subject to reasonable compensation
by Sucampo for Executive s time and expenses. Should Sucampo be unable, after reasonable effort, to obtain
Executive s signature on any document necessary to apply for or prosecute any of the above rights for any reason,
Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Sucampo or its officers and agents as Executive s agent coupled
with a power of attorney to act on Executive s behalf to do everything necessary to accomplish the above. 

Executive s Initials  

5.                  
 The provisions of this Section D do not apply to any invention if (a) Executive developed it entirely on Executive s
own time; (b) Executive did not use or rely on any of Sucampo s Confidential Information, equipment, supplies, or facilities;
(c) the invention is unrelated to Sucampo s business; and (d) the invention did not result from any work Executive performed
for Sucampo. If, when hired or during Executive s employment, Executive is working on any invention that is excluded under
this Section D.5. Executive agrees to put Sucampo on written notice at the time of hire or as soon as the Executive starts working
on the invention during Executive s employment. To further comply with this notice requirement, Executive has provided Exhibit
1 to this Agreement, which includes a complete list and description of all Inventions, intellectual property and equipment located
at Sucampo that is owned directly or indirectly by Executive and which shall not be transferred to Sucampo pursuant to this Agreement.
Except for those items listed on Exhibit 1, Executive agrees that he or she shall not assert any rights under any intellectual
property as having been made or acquired by Executive prior to being employed by Sucampo. If Sucampo and Executive disagree about
whether an invention is appropriately listed on Exhibit 1, Executive and Sucampo agree to submit the matter to arbitration per
the terms of Section I below. 

E.     Non-Competition And Non-Solicitation.  

1.                  
 Executive agrees that, as a result of Executive s position with Sucampo and/or the unique skills Executive brings
to Sucampo, Sucampo has entrusted Executive with information and customer relationships that are valuable to Sucampo, and that
Sucampo has a legitimate interest in protecting. Accordingly, Executive agrees that, during the term of this Agreement and for
a period of twelve consecutive months following the end of that employment, absent the prior written, signed consent of the President
of Sucampo, Executive shall not directly or indirectly render services, advice or assistance similar to the services Executive
provided while employed by Sucampo, or involving the Executive s use of knowledge Executive gained while employed at Sucampo,
to any Conflicting Organization, in connection with any Conflicting Product.  Conflicting Organization  means any person,
entity or organization engaged in research on, or development, production, or marketing of, a Conflicting Product.  Conflicting
Product  means any product, method, process, system or service provided for commercial use or sale of any person or organization
other than Sucampo, that is the same, similar to, or interchangeable with a product, method, process, system, or service provided
for commercial use or sale or under development for commercial use or sale by Sucampo when this Agreement terminates, or about
which Executive developed Protected Property while employed by Sucampo. The foregoing restrictions shall not prevent Executive
from working for or performing services on behalf of any business or other entity that offers Conflicting Products if such business
or entity is also engaged in other lines of business and if Executive certifies to Sucampo before accepting such employment that
Executive's employment or services shall be restricted to such other lines of business, and Executive shall not directly or indirectly
be providing support, advice, instruction, direction or other guidance to lines of business providing a Conflicting Product. 

2.                    Executive
agrees that, solely as a result of Executive s position and employment with Sucampo, Executive shall or has come to
know Confidential Information regarding some of Sucampo s employees, independent contractors and/or
consultants. Accordingly, both during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve consecutive months following the
end of that employment, Executive agrees to not directly or indirectly either on Executive s own account or on
behalf of any person, company, corporation, or other entity  induce, solicit, endeavor to entice or attempt to induce
any Sucampo Employees (as defined below) to: (a) leave employment with Sucampo; (b) supply any Sucampo Confidential
Information to any third party or entity; or (c) alter, sever, discontinue, or in any other way interfere with their
relationship with Sucampo.  Sucampo Employees  are Sucampo employees, independent contractors and consultants who
Executive has come to know as a result of Executive s employment with Sucampo, and with whom Executive had business
communications at any time during the last twenty-four months of the Term of this Agreement. 

Executive s Initials  

3.                  
 Executive agrees that, solely as a result of Executive s position and employment with Sucampo, Executive shall or
has come to know some of Sucampo s clients and has access to Confidential Information related to them. Accordingly, both
during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve consecutive months following the end of such employment, Executive
agrees to not, directly or indirectly, induce, solicit, endeavor to entice or attempt to induce any Sucampo Client (as defined
below) to cease doing business with Sucampo, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such Sucampo Client and
Sucampo.  Sucampo Clients  are individuals or entities of any nature, with whom/which Executive had business-related
involvement on behalf of Sucampo at any time during the last twenty-four months of the Term of this Agreement.  Business-related
involvement  includes Executive s direct communication with the Sucampo client, and any direct or indirect involvement
in any aspect of developing the initial relationship and any direct or indirect involvement on behalf of Sucampo in any aspect
of Sucampo s relationship with the Sucampo Client. 

4.                  
 Executive acknowledges and agrees that Sucampo operates globally, and the products and services of Sucampo are or are intended
to be marketed to customers on a global basis. Executive further acknowledges and agrees to the reasonableness of the provisions
in this Section E and the adequacy of the consideration supporting these provisions. Executive also acknowledges and agrees that
the provisions of this Section E will not preclude Executive from becoming gainfully employed following termination of employment
with Sucampo. 

F.     Breach of Obligations of Confidentiality, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.  

1.                    Executive
acknowledges that any threatened or actual breach of Section C or E of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to Sucampo,
for which money damages would be inadequate to compensate Sucampo. Consequently, in the event of a breach or
threatened breach of Section C or E of this Agreement, Executive agrees that Sucampo shall be entitled to expedited
arbitration under Section I of this Agreement to obtain injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement, without necessity of
posting a bond. In such an expedited arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator must issue a determination within 30 days after
Sucampo initiates the arbitration proceeding. The twelve-month period described in Section E shall be tolled during any
period when Executive is engaged in activity that violates the terms of Section E. In such an arbitration proceeding, the
arbitrator shall have the authority to award damages as appropriate. However, given the difficulty of assessing damages for
breaches of this Agreement, the Parties agree that, if the arbitrator finds Executive violated this Agreement, the arbitrator
must issue a damage award of, at minimum, $25,000. Each disclosure or transmission of Protected Property shall constitute a
separate violation and the minimum damage amount will apply to each violation. Further, if Executive breaches or fails to
honor any provision in Section C or E of this Agreement, and Sucampo is successful in whole or in part in any legal or
equitable action to defend its right under or to enforce any terms of Section C or E, Executive agrees to reimburse Sucampo
for Sucampo s costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys  fees associated with such action. In that event, the
arbitrator will be obligated to award Sucampo all its attorneys  fees and costs as part of the
arbitrator s determination. Executive waives any defense as to the validity of any liquidated damages stated in this
Agreement on the grounds that such liquidated damages are void as penalties or are not reasonably related to actual
damages. 

Executive s Initials  

2.                  
 Notwithstanding the language in Section F.1. above, under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall
not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that:
(a) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney;
and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made to Executive s
attorney in relation to a lawsuit for retaliation against Executive for reporting a suspected violation of law; or (c) is made
in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. 

G.     Sucampo Access.  

Executive agrees and consents
that, during the Term of this Agreement and thereafter, Sucampo may review, audit, intercept, review and disclose all messages
created, received or sent over the voice mail, electronic mail and Internet access systems provided by Sucampo, with or without
notice to Executive. Executive further consents and agrees that Sucampo may, at any time, access and review the contents of all
telephones and related systems, computers, computer disks, other data storage equipment and devices, files, desks, drawers, closets,
cabinets and work stations which are either on Sucampo s premises or which are owned or provided by Sucampo. Executive acknowledges
that Executive should have no expectation of privacy in any of the electronic communications systems or work areas described in
this paragraph. 

H.     Termination.  

1.                  
  Termination by Sucampo for Cause . Sucampo may terminate this Agreement and Executive s employment for Cause
(as defined below) by written notice with immediate effect. 

Cause  shall mean any of the following: 

(i)   
 the gross neglect, willful failure, or refusal of Executive to perform Executive's duties and/or responsibilities (other
than as a result of Executive's death or Disability); or 

(ii)   
 perpetration of an intentional and knowing fraud against or affecting the Company or any customer, supplier, client, agent
or employee thereof; or 

Executive s Initials  

(iii)      
 any willful or intentional act that could reasonably be expected to injure the reputation, financial condition, business
or business relationships of the Company or Executive's reputation or business relationships, including but not limited to any
act that could subject Sucampo to legal liability (e.g. violation of Sucampo s policy prohibiting sexual harassment); or 

(iv)   
 conviction (including conviction on a  nolo contendere  plea) of a felony or any crime involving fraud, dishonesty
or moral turpitude; or 

(v) the material breach
by Executive of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section C or E); or 

(vi)     
 Executive s supervisor demonstrates he/she had  legitimate reasons  to conclude Executive failed or refused to
perform Executive s job duties and/or responsibilities at an acceptable level, within 30 days after Executive s supervisor
provided Executive with written notice detailing the specific (unacceptable) performance areas and/or behavior that Executive must
improve to remain employed; or 

(vii)     
 Executive refuses to execute a modified Agreement offered by Sucampo on the Anniversary Date of this Agreement that is in
compliance with Section A.2; as long as the modified Agreement does not make any unilateral changes to Section B.1 (protections
against deductions in the Executive s Base Salary), Section H (Termination for Cause/Termination Without Cause/Resignation
for Good Reason/Change of Control/Separation Benefits) or substantially change Section I (agreement to arbitrate). 

2.
                  Termination Other Than For Cause  .  

a.                   
  Termination Without Cause . Either party may terminate this Agreement and Executive's employment hereunder at any
time upon 30 days  prior written notice to the other party. Executive s employment and this Agreement shall terminate
at the end of the 30-day notice period. Sucampo may elect to provide Executive with 30 days' salary in lieu of Executive's continued
active employment during the notice period. 

b.                    Resignation for Good Reason  .  

i.                    
 To resign for Good Reason, within 21 days of any event or condition that gives rise to Executive s belief that he/she
has Good Reason to resign, Executive must notify Sucampo in writing that Executive intends to resign for  Good Reason under
Section H.2.b  and state the reasons for Executive s belief he/she has reason to do so. Following receipt of such notice,
Sucampo will have 30 days (the  Cure Period ) to cure the issues identified by Executive. If, by the expiration of
the Cure Period, Sucampo has not cured the issues identified by Executive, and those issues meet the standard for Good Reason defined
below, Executive may resign for Good Reason. If Executive does not resign within 14 days following the Cure Period, Executive waives
any future right to resign for Good Reason based on the same reasons set forth in his/her 21 day letter. 

ii.                    As
used herein,  Good Reason  is the same standard as  constructive discharge  in Maryland
federal employment law cases. More specifically, to resign for Good Reason, Executive must establish that Sucampo
unilaterally made materially significant change(s) to, or diminutions of, Executive s work environment, commute to
work, terms, conditions; job duties, responsibilities and/or overall status of his/her position, that rendered
Executive s continued employment so  unbearable that a reasonable person would resign.  

Executive s Initials  

iii.                
 Executive shall have the right to resign for Good Reason if Sucampo requires Executive to accept any unilateral change(s)
to Section A.2, Section B.1 (Base Salary), Section H (standards for termination/resignation/death and disability/separation benefits),
Section N (limits to unilateral changes), or any materially significant changes to Section I (Arbitration) of this Agreement at
any time including before, on or after the Anniversary Date. If Executive resigns under this subsection H.2.b.iii, Sucampo
shall pay Executive the Separation Benefits enumerated in Section H.2.d without any obligation to meet the constructive discharge
standard for Good Reason set forth above in Section H.2.b.ii. In addition, if Executive resigns because Sucampo or its successor
makes unilateral changes to this Agreement to prepare for or within 12 months following a Change in Control, that qualify
as Good Reason under this Section H.2.b.iii, Sucampo and/or its successor shall pay Executive the  Change in Control Benefits 
enumerated below in Section H.3.b  instead of  the Separation Benefits in Section H.2.d. 

iv.                  If
Executive provides notice that he/she is resigning for Good Reason, Sucampo reserves the right to accept
Executive s resignation immediately, end the Agreement, release Executive from employment immediately or at any time
during the Cure Period, and pay Executive s Base Salary during the remaining Cure Period, up to a maximum of 30 days.
By electing to do so, Sucampo does not concede that Executive has met the condition(s) to resign for Good Reason defined
above. 

c.                   
  Death or Disability . If Executive dies, this Agreement and Executive's employment shall terminate automatically.
If Executive has or develops a disability that affects Executive s ability to work, Sucampo shall explore options with Executive
to determine whether Executive is able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.
In the event of any dispute as to whether Employee is disabled for purposes of this Section H.2.c., such dispute shall be resolved
by an independent physician competent to assess the condition at issue selected by Sucampo and performing such assessment at Sucampo s
expense. Upon termination of this Agreement due to Executive s death or disability, Sucampo shall provide Executive (or Executive s
estate, as applicable) with all of Executive s compensation and benefits that had fully accrued or fully vested as of the
date this Agreement terminated. No other compensation or benefits of any nature shall accrue, vest or continue after the effective
date the Agreement is terminated, except as provided under paragraph d. immediately below. 

d.                     Separation
Benefits . If Sucampo terminates Executive s employment without meeting the conditions for  Termination for
Cause  in Section H.1; if Executive resigns for Good Reason under the conditions set forth in Section H.2.b, or due to
the Executive s  Death or Disability  under Section H.2.c; and Executive (or the executor of
Executive s estate upon death or incapacity) signs and returns to Sucampo without revocation a release prepared by
Sucampo of all legally waivable claims related to or arising from Executive s employment with Sucampo and all other
terms determined exclusively by Sucampo, then (i) Sucampo shall pay Executive (or the estate): (A) the amount of any COBRA
continuation premium payments made by Executive during the 12-month period following the date of termination, or the period
ending when Executive becomes eligible for comparable group medical benefits coverage from another source (whichever comes
first); and (B) a lump sum payment equal to 12 months of Executive s then-current annual Base Salary, to be made not
later than 60 days following Executive s date of termination; and (ii) Executive s Equity Incentive Awards shall
vest as set forth in Section H.5 (collectively, the  Separation Benefits ). 

Executive s Initials  

3.
                  Termination in Connection with Change In Control  .  

a.                     This
Agreement terminates if it is not assumed by the successor corporation (or affiliate thereto) upon a Change in Control (as
defined below).  Change in Control  means: (i) the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50%
or more of the outstanding shares of the voting securities of Sucampo ; (ii) Sucampo is the non-surviving party in a merger;
(iii) Sucampo sells all or substantially all of its assets, provided, that no  Change in Control  shall be deemed
to have occurred merely as the result of a refinancing by Sucampo or as a result of Sucampo s insolvency or the
appointment of a conservator; or (iv) the Board of Directors of Sucampo, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that
there has been a sufficient change in the share ownership or ownership of the voting power of Sucampo s voting
securities to constitute a change of effective ownership or control of Sucampo. 

b.                  
 If, in advance of the closing or within 12 months following the occurrence of a Change in Control of Sucampo, this Agreement
is terminated other than for Cause, and Executive signs and returns to Sucampo without revocation a release prepared by Sucampo
of all legally waivable claims related to or arising from Executive s employment with Sucampo and all other terms determined
exclusively by Sucampo, then (i) Sucampo shall pay Executive: (A) the amount of any COBRA continuation premium payments made by
Executive during the 18- month period following the Date of Termination, or the period ending when Executive becomes eligible for
comparable group medical benefits coverage from another source (whichever comes first) and (B) a lump sum payment equal to the
sum of (1) 18 months of Executive s then-current annual Base Salary and (2) 150% of the current target bonus percentage of
the Executive s current annual Base Salary, to be made not later than 60 days following Executive s date of termination;
and (ii) Executive s Equity Incentive Awards shall vest as set forth in Section H.5 (collectively, the  Change in Control
Benefits ). 

c.                   
 If within 12 months following a Change in Control, there is a material diminution of Executive s role in the company,
material diminution of status, or diminution of reporting structure, Executive shall have the right to resign and receive the Change
in Control Benefits enumerated in Section H.3.b. without being required to satisfy the standard for Good Reason defined in Section
H.2.b.ii. 

4.                  Timing
Of Payments  .  

a.                     Sucampo
shall, only to the extent necessary, modify the timing of delivery of the Separation Benefits or the Change in Control
Benefits to Executive if Sucampo reasonably determines that the timing would subject such Benefit to any additional tax or
interest assessed under IRC Section 409A. In such event, the payments shall be made as soon as practicable without causing
the Benefit to trigger such additional tax or interest under Section 409A of the IRC. If any amount of the Benefit becomes
constitutes  nonqualified deferred compensation  within the meaning of Section 409A, payment of such amount shall
not commence until Executive incurs a  separation from service  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(h). If, at the time of Executive s separation from service, Executive is a  specified employee 
(under IRC Section 409A), any benefit as to which Section 409A penalties could be assessed that becomes payable to Executive
on account of Executive s  separation from service  (including any amounts payable pursuant to the
preceding sentence) shall be paid, without interest thereon, on the date six months and one day after such separation from
service. 

Executive s Initials  

b.                  
 Prior to paying any Change in Control Benefit, Sucampo shall cause its independent auditors promptly to review, at Sucampo's
sole expense, the applicability to those payments of Sections 280G and 4999 of the IRC. If the auditors determine that any payment
of the Change in Control Benefit would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the IRC or any interest or penalties
with respect to such excise tax, then such payment owed to Executive shall be reduced by an amount calculated to provide to Executive
the maximum Change in Control Benefits which will not trigger application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the IRC, with any such reduction
being made last with respect to benefits that are not exempt from IRC  409A. 

5.                  Effect
Of Termination On Equity Incentive Awards  .  

a.                   
 If this Agreement is terminated other than by Sucampo for Cause, any unvested Equity Incentive Awards that have a duration
vesting condition as defined in the Stock Agreement shall immediately vest to the extent such unvested Equity Incentive Awards
would have vested in the 12 months from the date of termination; or 

b.                  
 If Sucampo is acquired or is the non-surviving party in a merger, or Sucampo sells all of its assets, and in advance of
the closing of such transaction or within 12 months thereafter, this Agreement is terminated other than for Cause, any unvested
Equity Incentive Awards that have a duration vesting condition as defined in the Stock Agreement shall immediately vest and any
unvested Equity Incentive Awards with a performance condition shall immediately vest and may be exercised only to the extent the
performance targets have been achieved or would be achieved by such acquisition, merger or sale in accordance with the terms of
the Plan and the Stock Agreement. 

c.        
 If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with a provision of the Stock Agreement and/or the Plan, the provision more
favorable to the Executive shall govern. 

6.                  
  No Further Compensation . Executive shall receive all compensation and benefits provided to Executive by Sucampo that
fully accrued and fully vested before the date of termination of this Agreement. No other compensation or benefits of any nature
provided by Sucampo shall continue, accrue or vest after the date of termination, except as provided under the terms of any Sucampo
benefits plan in which Executive is enrolled as of the date of termination.

of this Agreement, or post-employment issues with Sucampo (collectively,  Covered Disputes ), including:

promissory estoppel), or tort claims; 

d.                  
 claims for benefits under the Executive Retirement Income Security Act, except claims under an employee pension or benefit
plan which specifies that its claims procedure shall culminate in an arbitration procedure different from this one, or is underwritten
by a commercial insurer which decides such claims. 

2.                 Covered Disputes
do not include: (a) claims for workers' compensation benefits; (b) claims for unemployment compensation benefits; (c) claims
based upon Sucampo's current (successor or future) stock option plans, employee pension and/or welfare benefit plans if those
plans contain some form of a grievance, arbitration, or other procedure for the resolution of disputes under the plan; and
(d) claims by law which are not subject to mandatory binding pre- dispute arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration
Act, such as claims under the Dodd-Frank Act. 

3.                  
 Executive agrees that, if Sucampo terminates the Agreement for Cause and an arbitrator later determines that Sucampo did
not have Cause to terminate the Agreement, then the remedy awarded to Executive shall be limited to such compensation and benefits
as Executive would have received in the event of Executive's termination other than for Cause at the same time as the original
termination. 

4.                  
 Executive affirms that Executive has been provided with a copy of Sucampo s Arbitration Procedures, and has had an
opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedures, to seek counsel, and has read, understands and accepts them. By signing
below, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that Sucampo has the unilateral right to amend its arbitration procedures from time
to time as long as the underlying procedures provide similar access to the arbitration process 

J.                      Executive s
Representations.   Executive represents to Sucampo that Executive has no obligations to any other person or entity
that conflict with the Executive s obligations under this Agreement. Executive further represents that, to the extent
Executive has disclosed information to Sucampo, created any original materials or used any proprietary information in
consulting, working or rendering services with, for or to Sucampo, Executive has the right to do so, and such actions
shall not violate any privacy, proprietary or other rights of others.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the United States
and the State of Maryland, without regard to its choice of law provisions. 

L.     Severability.  

If any term of this Agreement
is declared unenforceable, the decision-maker of competent jurisdiction shall interpret or modify this Agreement, to the extent
necessary, for it to be enforceable. If any term of this Agreement is declared unenforceable and cannot be modified to be enforceable,

shall not automatically be terminated, and Sucampo agrees to use its best efforts to ensure that the transferee or surviving company
shall assume and be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. The failure of either party to enforce any of the provisions in

the term of this Agreement, the Agreement may not be modified, altered or changed, except through a writing signed by both

Sucampo may elect to employ Executive at-will without an employment agreement, or either party may end Executive s
employment under the terms of Section H.

AGREEMENT  

This Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement
(the  Agreement ) is made by and between Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., its parent, subsidiary, predecessor and affiliated
corporations (collectively  Sucampo ), and Andrew Smith ( Executive ), and amends, restates and supersedes
the Employment Agreement between Sucampo and Executive dated January 30, 2015. 

A.     Employment and Duties.  

1.                  
 Sucampo shall employ Executive as Chief Financial Officer. While employed by Sucampo, Executive shall devote Executive s
full-time work efforts exclusively on behalf of Sucampo and shall not perform work of any nature for compensation of any kind for
any person or entity other than for Sucampo, unless approved in writing and signed by Sucampo s CEO. 

2.                  
 This Agreement shall be in effect for the one-year period following the first date on which both Executive and Sucampo have
signed the Agreement (the  Anniversary Date ). The Agreement will continue to renew on a year-to-year basis unless
either party ends the Executive s employment pursuant to Section H; or Sucampo delivers written notice to the Executive about
Sucampo s intent to renew the Agreement with specifically articulated changes at least 30 days before the Anniversary Date,
and then terminates the Agreement under Section N. 

B.     Compensation and Benefits.  

1.                  
  Base Salary . Sucampo shall pay Executive an annual base salary of Three Hundred Sixty Six Thousand Seven Hundred
Ninety Five US dollars and Sixty Three Cents (US 

 $366,795.63) in accordance with Sucampo s regular
payroll cycle (the  Base Salary ). The Base Salary shall be reviewed on an annual basis and may, in the sole discretion
of the Board of Directors, be increased, but not decreased (unless either mutually agreed by Executive and Sucampo, or established
as part of salary reductions that apply equally to similarly situated officers as a percentage reduction in their salaries). 

2.                  
  Bonus . Executive shall be entitled to participate in Sucampo s annual incentive plan, as defined and modified
from time to time by Sucampo. The target bonus for Executive shall be 40% of Executive s Base Salary, in the sole discretion
of the Board of Directors. The annual bonus payable to Executive for any fiscal year shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum on
the date set forth in Sucampo s incentive plan in effect at the time of payment. Sucampo reserves the unilateral right to
modify the incentive plan and reserves the unilateral discretion to determine the amount of Executive s bonus, if any. Executive
agrees that such bonus is not  earned  until approved by the Board of Directors. 

3.                     Stock .
At least annually for the Term of this Agreement, Executive shall be eligible for consideration to receive restricted stock
grants, stock options or other awards (collectively,  Equity Incentive Awards ) in accordance with the 2016

Executive s Initials  

4.                  
  Taxes . Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive shall be solely responsible for the satisfaction of any applicable
taxes that may arise pursuant to this Agreement (including taxes arising under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ),
which pertains to deferred compensation) or 4999 (which pertains to golden parachute excise taxes), and that neither Sucampo nor
any of its employees, officers, directors, or agents shall have any obligation whatsoever to pay such taxes or to otherwise indemnify
or hold Executive harmless from any or all of such taxes. For purposes of IRC Section 409A, the right to a series of installment
payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. All compensation due to Executive shall
be paid subject to withholding by Sucampo to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

5.                  
  Participation in Benefits . Executive shall be entitled to participate in all Sucampo employee benefit plans or programs
offered to other Sucampo employees to the extent that Executive's position, tenure, salary, and other qualifications make Executive
eligible to participate in such plans. Sucampo reserves the unilateral right to adopt, continue, discontinue, amend, modify, reduce
or expand each and every employee benefit plan, program or other fringe benefit during any term of the Agreement. Participation
by Executive in any such plan, program or benefit shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations. 

6.                  
  Expenses . Sucampo shall pay or reimburse Executive for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by Executive the performance of his or her obligations under this Agreement. Sucampo shall reimburse such expenses in accordance
with Sucampo s expense reimbursement policies and procedures. Sucampo reserves the right to modify such policies and procedures
in its sole discretion. All reimbursements due under this Agreement shall be separately requested and paid not later than one year
after Executive incurs the underlying expense. 

7.                  Professional
Organizations . During the Term, Sucampo shall reimburse Executive for the annual dues payable for membership in professional
societies associated with the Executive s job responsibilities or subject matters related to Sucampo s interests.
Sucampo shall only reimburse for a new membership if and after Sucampo has approved such membership. 

C.     Confidential Information.  

1.                  
 Executive acknowledges that Sucampo operates in a competitive environment and has a legitimate business interest in protecting
Sucampo s Confidential Information and Protected Property.  Confidential Information  includes any of the following
information pertaining to Sucampo or its affiliated entities: 

Executive s Initials  

a.                     Any
and all information, whether or not meeting the legal definition of a trade secret, and whether in written, oral,
electronic or other form, containing and/or concerning: (i) business plans, strategic plans, forecasts, budgets, sales,
financial projections and costs; (ii) personnel and payroll records and employee lists, including any information related to
an employee s health; (iii) candidates, consultants, and contractors, including lists, resumes, preferences,
transaction histories and rates; (iv) customers and prospective customers, including their identity, the identities of their
employees, contractors and consultants, special needs, job orders, preferences, transaction histories, contacts,
characteristics, agreements and current or proposed pricing; (v) marketing activities, plans, promotions, operations and
research and development; (vi) business operations, internal organizational structure and financial affairs; (vii) pricing
structure and/or current or proposed manufacturing costs; (viii) proposed services, technologies and products; (ix) contracts

information or processes, including chemical compounds, computer programs, code, algorithms, Inventions (as defined below),
formulae, test data, know how, functional and technical specifications, designs, drawings; (xiv) passwords; and 

b.                  
 Any information (including any compilation, device, method, technique or process) that (i) derives independent economic
value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons
who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances
to maintain its secrecy (hereafter  Trade Secret ). Such information constitutes a Trade Secret even if a person has
acquired the information without express notice that it is a Trade Secret if, under all the circumstances, such person knows or
has reason to know that the party who owns the information or has disclosed it intends or expects the secrecy of the type of information
comprising the Trade Secret to be maintained. 

c.                   
 The term  Confidential Information  excludes any information that (i) is, was, or enters in the public domain
without violation of this Agreement and through no fault of the Executive, (ii) was in Executive s possession free of any
obligation of confidence at the time it was disclosed to the Executive, or (iii) was rightfully communicated to the Executive by
a third party free of any obligation of confidentiality subsequent to the time it was disclosed by Sucampo to the Executive. 

2.                  
 During and after the Term of this Agreement, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, reproduce, commercialize, use,
disclose, or authorize use or disclosure of, any Confidential Information, unless such use or disclosure is (a) consistent with
Sucampo s obligations or business purposes and for the sole purpose of carrying out Executive s duties to Sucampo,
or (b) specifically authorized by Sucampo in writing prior to such use or disclosure. Executive understands and agrees that this
restriction shall continue to apply after this Agreement terminates, regardless of the reason for such termination. Executive agrees
to comply with all policies and procedures of Sucampo for protecting Confidential Information. 

3.                    Executive
agrees that Sucampo has the right to refuse publication of any papers prepared by Executive as a result of
Executive s employment, consultation, work or services, with, for, on behalf of or in conjunction with Sucampo.
Executive agrees to submit any proposed publications referring to Executive s employment, consultation, work, services
and activities with, for, on behalf of or in conjunction with Sucampo, or referring to any information developed therefrom,
to Sucampo for review, prior to publication, to ensure that Sucampo s position with respect to Confidential Information

thereof; and (c) if such compelled disclosure is required, Executive shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information

5.                  
 Executive agrees that, upon termination of this Agreement or if requested by Sucampo, Executive shall immediately return

all hard/electric copies thereof) in Executive s possession, custody or control. 

a.                   
  Sucampo Property  shall mean any and all documents, instruments, records and databases, recorded or stored
on any medium whatsoever, relating or pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the business of Sucampo, including without limitation
any and all documents (and copies) containing or relating to Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that Sucampo Property
is solely the property of Sucampo regardless of whether it was created, stored or used on property of the Executive or any other
person or entity. 

b.                  
 Executive agrees that, while employed by Sucampo, Executive shall not directly or indirectly, use, or allow the use of,
Sucampo property of any kind (including property leased to Sucampo), for any purpose other than Sucampo activities, except with

c.                   
 Executive agrees not to remove any Sucampo Property from Sucampo s business premises or deliver any Sucampo Property

Sucampo in writing. 

6.                    Executive

Agreement. 

Executive s Initials  

D.     Protected Property.  

1.                  
  Protected Property  includes any Invention (as defined below), discovery, improvement, idea or expression of
idea, process, development, design, know-how, data, and formula, whether patentable or un-patentable, or protectable by copyright
or other intellectual property law, that Executive makes or conceives, alone or with others, during or outside of working matters,
during Executive s employment with Sucampo, that relates in any manner to the actual or demonstrably anticipated business,
research or development of Sucampo, or results from or is suggested by any task assigned to Executive or any work performed by
Executive on behalf of Sucampo.  Invention  means any apparatus, biological processes, cell line, chemical compound,
creation, data, development, design, discovery, formula, idea, improvement, innovation, know-how, laboratory notebook, manuscript,
process or technique, whether or not patentable or protectable by copyright, or other intellectual property in any form. 

2.                  
 Executive agrees to communicate to Sucampo in writing as promptly and fully as practicable all Protected Property conceived
or reduced to practice by Executive at any time during the Executive s employment by Sucampo. Executive agrees to keep and
maintain adequate written records of Protected Property at all times and stages, in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, memoranda
and reports. Those records shall be the property of and be available to Sucampo at all times. 

3.                  
 Executive hereby assigns to Sucampo and/or its nominees, all of Executive s right, title, and interest in such Protected
Property, and all of the Executive s right, title, and interest in any patents, copyrights, patent applications, software,
trademarks, or copyright applications based thereon. Executive agrees that all Protected Property subject to copyright protection
constitutes  work made for hire  under United States copyright laws (17 U.S.C.   

 101) and is owned exclusively Sucampo. To the extent
that title to any Protected Property subject to copyright protection does not constitute a  work for hire,  and to the
extent title to any other Protected Property does not, by operation of law or otherwise, vest in Sucampo, all right, title, and
interest therein, including, without limitation, all copyrights, patents and trade secrets, and all copyrightable or patentable
subject matter, are hereby irrevocably assigned to Sucampo. 

4.                    Executive
shall, at the expense of and on behalf of Sucampo, do everything reasonably necessary for Sucampo to obtain, preserve, and
protect Sucampo's right, title and interest in and to such Protected Property, including preparing and signing all documents
Sucampo may deem necessary to obtain and maintain patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks and other
rights within the United States or anywhere in the world. This obligation binds Executive or Executive s legal
representative and continues despite the end of Executive s employment with Sucampo, subject to reasonable compensation
by Sucampo for Executive s time and expenses. Should Sucampo be unable, after reasonable effort, to obtain
Executive s signature on any document necessary to apply for or prosecute any of the above rights for any reason,
Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Sucampo or its officers and agents as Executive s agent coupled
with a power of attorney to act on Executive s behalf to do everything necessary to accomplish the above. 

Executive s Initials  

5.                  
 The provisions of this Section D do not apply to any invention if (a) Executive developed it entirely on Executive s
own time; (b) Executive did not use or rely on any of Sucampo s Confidential Information, equipment, supplies, or facilities;
(c) the invention is unrelated to Sucampo s business; and (d) the invention did not result from any work Executive performed
for Sucampo. If, when hired or during Executive s employment, Executive is working on any invention that is excluded under
this Section D.5. Executive agrees to put Sucampo on written notice at the time of hire or as soon as the Executive starts working
on the invention during Executive s employment. To further comply with this notice requirement, Executive has provided Exhibit
1 to this Agreement, which includes a complete list and description of all Inventions, intellectual property and equipment located
at Sucampo that is owned directly or indirectly by Executive and which shall not be transferred to Sucampo pursuant to this Agreement.
Except for those items listed on Exhibit 1, Executive agrees that he or she shall not assert any rights under any intellectual
property as having been made or acquired by Executive prior to being employed by Sucampo. If Sucampo and Executive disagree about
whether an invention is appropriately listed on Exhibit 1, Executive and Sucampo agree to submit the matter to arbitration per
the terms of Section I below. 

E.     Non-Competition And Non-Solicitation.  

1.                  
 Executive agrees that, as a result of Executive s position with Sucampo and/or the unique skills Executive brings
to Sucampo, Sucampo has entrusted Executive with information and customer relationships that are valuable to Sucampo, and that
Sucampo has a legitimate interest in protecting. Accordingly, Executive agrees that, during the term of this Agreement and for
a period of twelve consecutive months following the end of that employment, absent the prior written, signed consent of the President
of Sucampo, Executive shall not directly or indirectly render services, advice or assistance similar to the services Executive
provided while employed by Sucampo, or involving the Executive s use of knowledge Executive gained while employed at Sucampo,
to any Conflicting Organization, in connection with any Conflicting Product.  Conflicting Organization  means any person,
entity or organization engaged in research on, or development, production, or marketing of, a Conflicting Product.  Conflicting
Product  means any product, method, process, system or service provided for commercial use or sale of any person or organization
other than Sucampo, that is the same, similar to, or interchangeable with a product, method, process, system, or service provided
for commercial use or sale or under development for commercial use or sale by Sucampo when this Agreement terminates, or about
which Executive developed Protected Property while employed by Sucampo. The foregoing restrictions shall not prevent Executive
from working for or performing services on behalf of any business or other entity that offers Conflicting Products if such business
or entity is also engaged in other lines of business and if Executive certifies to Sucampo before accepting such employment that
Executive's employment or services shall be restricted to such other lines of business, and Executive shall not directly or indirectly
be providing support, advice, instruction, direction or other guidance to lines of business providing a Conflicting Product. 

2.                    Executive
agrees that, solely as a result of Executive s position and employment with Sucampo, Executive shall or has come to
know Confidential Information regarding some of Sucampo s employees, independent contractors and/or
consultants. Accordingly, both during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve consecutive months following the
end of that employment, Executive agrees to not directly or indirectly either on Executive s own account or on
behalf of any person, company, corporation, or other entity  induce, solicit, endeavor to entice or attempt to induce
any Sucampo Employees (as defined below) to: (a) leave employment with Sucampo; (b) supply any Sucampo Confidential
Information to any third party or entity; or (c) alter, sever, discontinue, or in any other way interfere with their
relationship with Sucampo.  Sucampo Employees  are Sucampo employees, independent contractors and consultants who
Executive has come to know as a result of Executive s employment with Sucampo, and with whom Executive had business
communications at any time during the last twenty-four months of the Term of this Agreement. 

Executive s Initials  

3.                  
 Executive agrees that, solely as a result of Executive s position and employment with Sucampo, Executive shall or
has come to know some of Sucampo s clients and has access to Confidential Information related to them. Accordingly, both
during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve consecutive months following the end of such employment, Executive
agrees to not, directly or indirectly, induce, solicit, endeavor to entice or attempt to induce any Sucampo Client (as defined
below) to cease doing business with Sucampo, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such Sucampo Client and
Sucampo.  Sucampo Clients  are individuals or entities of any nature, with whom/which Executive had business-related
involvement on behalf of Sucampo at any time during the last twenty-four months of the Term of this Agreement.  Business-related
involvement  includes Executive s direct communication with the Sucampo client, and any direct or indirect involvement
in any aspect of developing the initial relationship and any direct or indirect involvement on behalf of Sucampo in any aspect
of Sucampo s relationship with the Sucampo Client. 

4.                  
 Executive acknowledges and agrees that Sucampo operates globally, and the products and services of Sucampo are or are intended
to be marketed to customers on a global basis. Executive further acknowledges and agrees to the reasonableness of the provisions
in this Section E and the adequacy of the consideration supporting these provisions. Executive also acknowledges and agrees that
the provisions of this Section E will not preclude Executive from becoming gainfully employed following termination of employment
with Sucampo. 

F.     Breach of Obligations of Confidentiality, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.  

1.                    Executive
acknowledges that any threatened or actual breach of Section C or E of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to Sucampo,
for which money damages would be inadequate to compensate Sucampo. Consequently, in the event of a breach or
threatened breach of Section C or E of this Agreement, Executive agrees that Sucampo shall be entitled to expedited
arbitration under Section I of this Agreement to obtain injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement, without necessity of
posting a bond. In such an expedited arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator must issue a determination within 30 days after
Sucampo initiates the arbitration proceeding. The twelve-month period described in Section E shall be tolled during any
period when Executive is engaged in activity that violates the terms of Section E. In such an arbitration proceeding, the
arbitrator shall have the authority to award damages as appropriate. However, given the difficulty of assessing damages for
breaches of this Agreement, the Parties agree that, if the arbitrator finds Executive violated this Agreement, the arbitrator
must issue a damage award of, at minimum, $25,000. Each disclosure or transmission of Protected Property shall constitute a
separate violation and the minimum damage amount will apply to each violation. Further, if Executive breaches or fails to
honor any provision in Section C or E of this Agreement, and Sucampo is successful in whole or in part in any legal or
equitable action to defend its right under or to enforce any terms of Section C or E, Executive agrees to reimburse Sucampo
for Sucampo s costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys  fees associated with such action. In that event, the
arbitrator will be obligated to award Sucampo all its attorneys  fees and costs as part of the
arbitrator s determination. Executive waives any defense as to the validity of any liquidated damages stated in this
Agreement on the grounds that such liquidated damages are void as penalties or are not reasonably related to actual
damages. 

Executive s Initials  

2.                  
 Notwithstanding the language in Section F.1. above, under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall
not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that:
(a) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney;
and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made to Executive s
attorney in relation to a lawsuit for retaliation against Executive for reporting a suspected violation of law; or (c) is made
in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. 

G.     Sucampo Access.  

Executive agrees and consents
that, during the Term of this Agreement and thereafter, Sucampo may review, audit, intercept, review and disclose all messages
created, received or sent over the voice mail, electronic mail and Internet access systems provided by Sucampo, with or without
notice to Executive. Executive further consents and agrees that Sucampo may, at any time, access and review the contents of all
telephones and related systems, computers, computer disks, other data storage equipment and devices, files, desks, drawers, closets,
cabinets and work stations which are either on Sucampo s premises or which are owned or provided by Sucampo. Executive acknowledges
that Executive should have no expectation of privacy in any of the electronic communications systems or work areas described in
this paragraph. 

H.     Termination.  

1.                  
  Termination by Sucampo for Cause . Sucampo may terminate this Agreement and Executive s employment for Cause
(as defined below) by written notice with immediate effect. 

Cause  shall mean any of the following: 

(i)   
 the gross neglect, willful failure, or refusal of Executive to perform Executive's duties and/or responsibilities (other
than as a result of Executive's death or Disability); or 

(ii)   
 perpetration of an intentional and knowing fraud against or affecting the Company or any customer, supplier, client, agent
or employee thereof; or 

Executive s Initials  

(iii)      
 any willful or intentional act that could reasonably be expected to injure the reputation, financial condition, business
or business relationships of the Company or Executive's reputation or business relationships, including but not limited to any
act that could subject Sucampo to legal liability (e.g. violation of Sucampo s policy prohibiting sexual harassment); or 

(iv)   
 conviction (including conviction on a  nolo contendere  plea) of a felony or any crime involving fraud, dishonesty
or moral turpitude; or 

(v) the material breach by Executive of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, Section C or E); or 

(vi)     
 Executive s supervisor demonstrates he/she had  legitimate reasons  to conclude Executive failed or refused to
perform Executive s job duties and/or responsibilities at an acceptable level, within 30 days after Executive s supervisor
provided Executive with written notice detailing the specific (unacceptable) performance areas and/or behavior that Executive must
improve to remain employed; or 

(vii)     
 Executive refuses to execute a modified Agreement offered by Sucampo on the Anniversary Date of this Agreement that is in
compliance with Section A.2; as long as the modified Agreement does not make any unilateral changes to Section B.1 (protections
against deductions in the Executive s Base Salary), Section H (Termination for Cause/Termination Without Cause/Resignation
for Good Reason/Change of Control/Separation Benefits) or substantially change Section I (agreement to arbitrate). 

2.  Termination Other Than For Cause  .  

a.                   
  Termination Without Cause . Either party may terminate this Agreement and Executive's employment hereunder at any
time upon 30 days  prior written notice to the other party. Executive s employment and this Agreement shall terminate
at the end of the 30-day notice period. Sucampo may elect to provide Executive with 30 days' salary in lieu of Executive's continued
active employment during the notice period. 

b.                    Resignation
for Good Reason  .  

i.                    
 To resign for Good Reason, within 21 days of any event or condition that gives rise to Executive s belief that he/she
has Good Reason to resign, Executive must notify Sucampo in writing that Executive intends to resign for  Good Reason under
Section H.2.b  and state the reasons for Executive s belief he/she has reason to do so. Following receipt of such notice,
Sucampo will have 30 days (the  Cure Period ) to cure the issues identified by Executive. If, by the expiration of
the Cure Period, Sucampo has not cured the issues identified by Executive, and those issues meet the standard for Good Reason defined
below, Executive may resign for Good Reason. If Executive does not resign within 14 days following the Cure Period, Executive waives
any future right to resign for Good Reason based on the same reasons set forth in his/her 21 day letter. 

ii.                    As
used herein,  Good Reason  is the same standard as  constructive discharge  in Maryland
federal employment law cases. More specifically, to resign for Good Reason, Executive must establish that Sucampo
unilaterally made materially significant change(s) to, or diminutions of, Executive s work environment, commute to
work, terms, conditions; job duties, responsibilities and/or overall status of his/her position, that rendered
Executive s continued employment so  unbearable that a reasonable person would resign.  

Executive s Initials  

iii.                
 Executive shall have the right to resign for Good Reason if Sucampo requires Executive to accept any unilateral change(s)
to Section A.2, Section B.1 (Base Salary), Section H (standards for termination/resignation/death and disability/separation benefits),
Section N (limits to unilateral changes), or any materially significant changes to Section I (Arbitration) of this Agreement at
any time including before, on or after the Anniversary Date. If Executive resigns under this subsection H.2.b.iii, Sucampo
shall pay Executive the Separation Benefits enumerated in Section H.2.d without any obligation to meet the constructive discharge
standard for Good Reason set forth above in Section H.2.b.ii. In addition, if Executive resigns because Sucampo or its successor
makes unilateral changes to this Agreement to prepare for or within 12 months following a Change in Control, that qualify
as Good Reason under this Section H.2.b.iii, Sucampo and/or its successor shall pay Executive the  Change in Control Benefits 
enumerated below in Section H.3.b  instead of  the Separation Benefits in Section H.2.d. 

iv.                  If
Executive provides notice that he/she is resigning for Good Reason, Sucampo reserves the right to accept
Executive s resignation immediately, end the Agreement, release Executive from employment immediately or at any time
during the Cure Period, and pay Executive s Base Salary during the remaining Cure Period, up to a maximum of 30 days.
By electing to do so, Sucampo does not concede that Executive has met the condition(s) to resign for Good Reason defined
above. 

c.                   
  Death or Disability . If Executive dies, this Agreement and Executive's employment shall terminate automatically.
If Executive has or develops a disability that affects Executive s ability to work, Sucampo shall explore options with Executive
to determine whether Executive is able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.
In the event of any dispute as to whether Employee is disabled for purposes of this Section H.2.c., such dispute shall be resolved
by an independent physician competent to assess the condition at issue selected by Sucampo and performing such assessment at Sucampo s
expense. Upon termination of this Agreement due to Executive s death or disability, Sucampo shall provide Executive (or Executive s
estate, as applicable) with all of Executive s compensation and benefits that had fully accrued or fully vested as of the
date this Agreement terminated. No other compensation or benefits of any nature shall accrue, vest or continue after the effective
date the Agreement is terminated, except as provided under paragraph d. immediately below. 

d.                     Separation
Benefits . If Sucampo terminates Executive s employment without meeting the conditions for  Termination for
Cause  in Section H.1; if Executive resigns for Good Reason under the conditions set forth in Section H.2.b, or due to
the Executive s  Death or Disability  under Section H.2.c; and Executive (or the executor of
Executive s estate upon death or incapacity) signs and returns to Sucampo without revocation a release prepared by
Sucampo of all legally waivable claims related to or arising from Executive s employment with Sucampo and all other
terms determined exclusively by Sucampo, then (i) Sucampo shall pay Executive (or the estate): (A) the amount of any COBRA
continuation premium payments made by Executive during the 12-month period following the date of termination, or the period
ending when Executive becomes eligible for comparable group medical benefits coverage from another source (whichever comes
first); and (B) a lump sum payment equal to 12 months of Executive s then-current annual Base Salary, to be made not
later than 60 days following Executive s date of termination; and (ii) Executive s Equity Incentive Awards shall
vest as set forth in Section H.5 (collectively, the  Separation Benefits ). 

Executive s Initials  

3.                   Termination
in Connection with Change In Control  .  

a.                   
 This Agreement terminates if it is not assumed by the successor corporation (or affiliate thereto) upon a Change in Control
(as defined below). 

Change in Control 
means: (i) the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of the voting securities
of Sucampo ; (ii) Sucampo is the non-surviving party in a merger; (iii) Sucampo sells all or substantially all of its assets, provided,
that no  Change in Control  shall be deemed to have occurred merely as the result of a refinancing by Sucampo or as
a result of Sucampo s insolvency or the appointment of a conservator; or (iv) the Board of Directors of Sucampo, in its sole
and absolute discretion, determines that there has been a sufficient change in the share ownership or ownership of the voting power
of Sucampo s voting securities to constitute a change of effective ownership or control of Sucampo. 

b.                  
 If, in advance of the closing or within 12 months following the occurrence of a Change in Control of Sucampo, this Agreement
is terminated other than for Cause, and Executive signs and returns to Sucampo without revocation a release prepared by Sucampo
of all legally waivable claims related to or arising from Executive s employment with Sucampo and all other terms determined
exclusively by Sucampo, then (i) Sucampo shall pay Executive: (A) the amount of any COBRA continuation premium payments made by
Executive during the 18- month period following the Date of Termination, or the period ending when Executive becomes eligible for
comparable group medical benefits coverage from another source (whichever comes first) and (B) a lump sum payment equal to the
sum of (1) 18 months of Executive s then-current annual Base Salary and (2) 150% of the current target bonus percentage of
the Executive s current annual Base Salary, to be made not later than 60 days following Executive s date of termination;
and (ii) Executive s Equity Incentive Awards shall vest as set forth in Section H.5 (collectively, the  Change in Control
Benefits ). 

c.                   
 If within 12 months following a Change in Control, there is a material diminution of Executive s role in the company,
material diminution of status, or diminution of reporting structure, Executive shall have the right to resign and receive the Change
in Control Benefits enumerated in Section H.3.b. without being required to satisfy the standard for Good Reason defined in Section
H.2.b.ii. 

4.                  Timing
Of Payments  .  

a.                     Sucampo
shall, only to the extent necessary, modify the timing of delivery of the Separation Benefits or the Change in Control
Benefits to Executive if Sucampo reasonably determines that the timing would subject such Benefit to any additional tax or
interest assessed under IRC Section 409A. In such event, the payments shall be made as soon as practicable without causing
the Benefit to trigger such additional tax or interest under Section 409A of the IRC. If any amount of the Benefit becomes
constitutes  nonqualified deferred compensation  within the meaning of Section 409A, payment of such amount shall
not commence until Executive incurs a  separation from service  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(h). If, at the time of Executive s separation from service, Executive is a  specified employee 
(under IRC Section 409A), any benefit as to which Section 409A penalties could be assessed that becomes payable to Executive
on account of Executive s  separation from service  (including any amounts payable pursuant to the
preceding sentence) shall be paid, without interest thereon, on the date six months and one day after such separation from
service. 

Executive s Initials  

b.                  
 Prior to paying any Change in Control Benefit, Sucampo shall cause its independent auditors promptly to review, at Sucampo's
sole expense, the applicability to those payments of Sections 280G and 4999 of the IRC. If the auditors determine that any payment
of the Change in Control Benefit would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the IRC or any interest or penalties
with respect to such excise tax, then such payment owed to Executive shall be reduced by an amount calculated to provide to Executive
the maximum Change in Control Benefits which will not trigger application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the IRC, with any such reduction
being made last with respect to benefits that are not exempt from IRC  409A. 

5.                   Effect
Of Termination On Equity Incentive Awards  .  

a.                   
 If this Agreement is terminated other than by Sucampo for Cause, any unvested Equity Incentive Awards that have a duration
vesting condition as defined in the Stock Agreement shall immediately vest to the extent such unvested Equity Incentive Awards
would have vested in the 12 months from the date of termination; or 

b.                  
 If Sucampo is acquired or is the non-surviving party in a merger, or Sucampo sells all of its assets, and in advance of
the closing of such transaction or within 12 months thereafter, this Agreement is terminated other than for Cause, any unvested
Equity Incentive Awards that have a duration vesting condition as defined in the Stock Agreement shall immediately vest and any
unvested Equity Incentive Awards with a performance condition shall immediately vest and may be exercised only to the extent the
performance targets have been achieved or would be achieved by such acquisition, merger or sale in accordance with the terms of
the Plan and the Stock Agreement. 

c.        
 If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with a provision of the Stock Agreement and/or the Plan, the provision more
favorable to the Executive shall govern. 

6.                  
  No Further Compensation . Executive shall receive all compensation and benefits provided to Executive by Sucampo that
fully accrued and fully vested before the date of termination of this Agreement. No other compensation or benefits of any nature
provided by Sucampo shall continue, accrue or vest after the date of termination, except as provided under the terms of any Sucampo
benefits plan in which Executive is enrolled as of the date of termination.

I.     Arbitration.  

1.                  
 Executive and Sucampo agree to resolve by arbitration any and all disputes arising from or relating to Executive s
employment with Sucampo, Executive s application for such employment, the termination of this Agreement, any alleged breach
of this Agreement, or post-employment issues with Sucampo (collectively,  Covered Disputes ), including:

3.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the United States

L.     Severability.  

If any term of this Agreement
is declared unenforceable, the decision-maker of competent jurisdiction shall interpret or modify this Agreement, to the extent

inducements, agreements or understandings between the Parties regarding such topics. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of Sucampo, its successors and assigns, without the need for further agreement or consent by Executive. If Sucampo

shall not automatically be terminated, and Sucampo agrees to use its best efforts to ensure that the transferee or surviving company
shall assume and be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. The failure of either party to enforce any of the provisions in
this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of that party to enforce any such provision. 

2.                    During
the term of this Agreement, the Agreement may not be modified, altered or changed, except through a writing signed by both
Parties. On the Anniversary Date of this Agreement, Sucampo reserves the unilateral right to modify any term of this
Agreement except for the terms of Section B.1, Section H. Section I or Section N so long as Sucampo complies with the notice
requirements in Section A.2 above. If Executive rejects Sucampo s modified Agreement that complies with Section N,
Sucampo may elect to employ Executive at-will without an employment agreement, or either party may end Executive s
employment under the terms of Section H.

  Employment and Duties.  

1.

While employed by Sucampo, Executive shall devote Executive s full-time work efforts exclusively on behalf of Sucampo and
shall not perform work of any nature for compensation of any kind for any person or entity other than for Sucampo, unless approved
in writing and signed by Sucampo s CEO. 

2.                  
 This Agreement shall be in effect for the one-year period following the first date on which both Executive and Sucampo have
signed the Agreement (the  Anniversary Date ). The Agreement will continue to renew on a year-to-year basis unless
either party ends the Executive s employment pursuant to Section H; or Sucampo delivers written notice to the Executive about
Sucampo s intent to renew the Agreement with specifically articulated changes at least 30 days before the Anniversary Date,
and then terminates the Agreement under Section N. 

B.   Compensation and Benefits.    

1.                  
  Base Salary . Sucampo shall pay Executive an annual base salary of Four Hundred Thousand Three Hundred Seventy Two
US dollars and Fifty Cents (US $ 400,372.50 ) in accordance with Sucampo s regular payroll cycle (the  Base Salary ).
The Base Salary shall be reviewed on an annual basis and may, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, be increased, but
not decreased (unless either mutually agreed by Executive and Sucampo, or established as part of salary reductions that apply equally
to similarly situated officers as a percentage reduction in their salaries). 

2.                  
  Bonus . Executive shall be entitled to participate in Sucampo s annual incentive plan, as defined and modified
from time to time by Sucampo. The target bonus for Executive shall be 40% of Executive s Base Salary, in the sole discretion
of the Board of Directors. The annual bonus payable to Executive for any fiscal year shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum on
the date set forth in Sucampo s incentive plan in effect at the time of payment. Sucampo reserves the unilateral right to
modify the incentive plan and reserves the unilateral discretion to determine the amount of Executive s bonus, if any. Executive
agrees that such bonus is not  earned  until approved by the Board of Directors. 

3.

Executive s Initials  

(collectively,  Equity Incentive Awards )

any of its employees, officers, directors, or agents shall have any obligation whatsoever to pay such taxes or to otherwise indemnify
or hold Executive harmless from any or all of such taxes. For purposes of IRC Section 409A, the right to a series of installment
payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. All compensation due to Executive shall
be paid subject to withholding by Sucampo to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

5.                  
  Participation in Benefits . Executive shall be entitled to participate in all Sucampo employee benefit plans or programs
offered to other Sucampo employees to the extent that Executive's position, tenure, salary, and other qualifications make Executive
eligible to participate in such plans. Sucampo reserves the unilateral right to adopt, continue, discontinue, amend, modify, reduce
or expand each and every employee benefit plan, program or other fringe benefit during any term of the Agreement. Participation
by Executive in any such plan, program or benefit shall be subject to all applicable rules and regulations. 

6.                  
  Expenses . Sucampo shall pay or reimburse Executive for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by Executive the performance of his or her obligations under this Agreement. Sucampo shall reimburse such expenses in accordance
with Sucampo s expense reimbursement policies and procedures. Sucampo reserves the right to modify such policies and procedures
in its sole discretion. All reimbursements due under this Agreement shall be separately requested and paid not later than one year
after Executive incurs the underlying expense. 

7.                  
  Professional Organizations . During the Term, Sucampo shall reimburse Executive for the annual dues payable for membership
in professional societies associated with the Executive s job responsibilities or subject matters related to Sucampo s

who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances
to maintain its secrecy (hereafter  Trade Secret ). Such information constitutes a Trade Secret even if a person has

has reason to know that the party who owns the information or has disclosed it intends or expects the secrecy of the type of information
comprising the Trade Secret to be maintained. 

c.                   
 The term  Confidential Information  excludes any information that (i) is, was, or enters in the public domain
without violation of this Agreement and through no fault of the Executive, (ii) was in Executive s possession free of any
obligation of confidence at the time it was disclosed to the Executive, or (iii) was rightfully communicated to the Executive by
a third party free of any obligation of confidentiality subsequent to the time it was disclosed by Sucampo to the Executive. 

2.

disclose, or authorize use or disclosure of, any Confidential Information, unless such use or disclosure is (a) consistent with
Sucampo s obligations or business purposes and for the sole purpose of carrying out Executive s duties to Sucampo,
or (b) specifically authorized by Sucampo in writing prior to such use or disclosure. Executive understands and agrees that this
restriction shall continue to apply after this Agreement terminates, regardless of the reason for such termination. Executive agrees
to comply with all policies and procedures of Sucampo for protecting Confidential Information. 

3.

Executive agrees to submit any proposed publications referring to Executive s employment, consultation, work, services and
activities with, for, on behalf of or in conjunction with Sucampo, or referring to any information developed therefrom, to Sucampo
for review, prior to publication, to ensure that Sucampo s position with respect to Confidential Information is not adversely
affected by publication disclosures. 

4.                  
 If Executive is required to disclose Confidential Information due to the issuance of a court order or other government process,
Executive shall (a) promptly, but in no event more than 72 hours after learning of such court order or other government process,
notify the General Counsel; (b) at Sucampo s expense, take all reasonable necessary steps requested by Sucampo to defend
against the enforcement of such court order or other government process, and permit Sucampo to intervene and participate with counsel

on any medium whatsoever, relating or pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the business of Sucampo, including without limitation

is solely the property of Sucampo regardless of whether it was created, stored or used on property of the Executive or any other
person or entity. 

b.                  
 Executive agrees that, while employed by Sucampo, Executive shall not directly or indirectly, use, or allow the use of,

Sucampo Property to Sucampo, permanently delete the Sucampo Property from the computer or device, and confirm these actions to
Sucampo in writing.

during Executive s employment with Sucampo, that relates in any manner to the actual or demonstrably anticipated business,
research or development of Sucampo, or results from or is suggested by any task assigned to Executive or any work performed by

 Executive hereby assigns to Sucampo and/or its nominees, all of Executive s right, title, and interest in such Protected
Property, and all of the Executive s right, title, and interest in any patents, copyrights, patent applications, software,
trademarks, or copyright applications based thereon. Executive agrees that all Protected Property subject to copyright protection
constitutes  work made for hire  under United States copyright laws (17 U.S.C.   

 101) and is owned exclusively Sucampo. To the extent
that title to any Protected Property subject to copyright protection does not constitute a  work for hire,  and to the
extent title to any other Protected Property does not, by operation of law or otherwise, vest in Sucampo, all right, title, and
interest therein, including, without limitation, all copyrights, patents and trade secrets, and all copyrightable or patentable
subject matter, are hereby irrevocably assigned to Sucampo. 

4.                  
 Executive shall, at the expense of and on behalf of Sucampo, do everything reasonably necessary for Sucampo to obtain, preserve,
and protect Sucampo's right, title and interest in and to such Protected Property, including preparing and signing all documents
Sucampo may deem necessary to obtain and maintain patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks and other rights
within the United States or anywhere in the world. This obligation binds Executive or Executive s legal representative and
continues despite the end of Executive s employment with Sucampo, subject to reasonable compensation by Sucampo for Executive s
time and expenses. Should Sucampo be unable, after reasonable effort, to obtain Executive s signature on any document necessary
to apply for or prosecute any of the above rights for any reason, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Sucampo
or its officers and agents as Executive s agent coupled with a power of attorney to act on Executive s behalf to do
everything necessary to accomplish the above. 

Executive s Initials

whether an invention is appropriately listed on Exhibit 1, Executive and Sucampo agree to submit the matter to arbitration per
the terms of Section I below. 

E.   Non-Competition And Non-Solicitation.

Sucampo has a legitimate interest in protecting. Accordingly, Executive agrees that, during the term of this Agreement and for
a period of twelve consecutive months following the end of that employment, absent the prior written, signed consent of the President
of Sucampo, Executive shall not directly or indirectly render services, advice or assistance similar to the services Executive
provided while employed by Sucampo, or involving the Executive s use of knowledge Executive gained while employed at Sucampo,

which Executive developed Protected Property while employed by Sucampo. The foregoing restrictions shall not prevent Executive
from working for or performing services on behalf of any business or other entity that offers Conflicting Products if such business
or entity is also engaged in other lines of business and if Executive certifies to Sucampo before accepting such employment that
Executive's employment or services shall be restricted to such other lines of business, and Executive shall not directly or indirectly
be providing support, advice, instruction, direction or other guidance to lines of business providing a Conflicting Product.

Accordingly, both during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve consecutive months following the end of that employment,
Executive agrees to not directly or indirectly either on Executive s own account 

Executive s Initials  

or on behalf of any person, company, corporation,
or other entity  induce, solicit, endeavor to entice or attempt to induce any Sucampo Employees (as defined below) to:
(a) leave employment with Sucampo; (b) supply any Sucampo Confidential Information to any third party or entity; or (c)
alter, sever, discontinue, or in any other way interfere with their relationship with Sucampo.  Sucampo
Employees  are Sucampo employees, independent contractors and consultants who Executive has come to know as a result of
Executive s employment with Sucampo, and with whom Executive had business communications at any time during the last
twenty-four months of the Term of this Agreement. 

3.                  
 Executive agrees that, solely as a result of Executive s position and employment with Sucampo, Executive shall or

agrees to not, directly or indirectly, induce, solicit, endeavor to entice or attempt to induce any Sucampo Client (as defined
below) to cease doing business with Sucampo, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such Sucampo Client and
Sucampo.  Sucampo Clients  are individuals or entities of any nature, with whom/which Executive had business-related
involvement on behalf of Sucampo at any time during the last twenty-four months of the Term of this Agreement.  Business-related
involvement  includes Executive s direct communication with the Sucampo client, and any direct or indirect involvement
in any aspect of developing the initial relationship and any direct or indirect involvement on behalf of Sucampo in any aspect
of Sucampo s relationship with the Sucampo Client. 

4.                  
 Executive acknowledges and agrees that Sucampo operates globally, and the products and services of Sucampo are or are intended
to be marketed to customers on a global basis. Executive further acknowledges and agrees to the reasonableness of the provisions
in this Section E and the adequacy of the consideration supporting these provisions. Executive also acknowledges and agrees that
the provisions of this Section E will not preclude Executive from becoming gainfully employed following termination of employment
with Sucampo. 

F.   Breach of Obligations of Confidentiality, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.    

1.                  
 Executive acknowledges that any threatened or actual breach of Section C or E of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm
to Sucampo, for which money damages would be inadequate to compensate Sucampo. Consequently, in the event of a breach or threatened
breach of Section C or E of this Agreement, Executive agrees that Sucampo shall be entitled to expedited arbitration under Section
I of this Agreement to obtain injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement, without necessity of posting a bond. In such an expedited
arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator must issue a determination within 30 days after Sucampo initiates the arbitration proceeding.
The twelve-month period described in Section E shall be tolled during any period when Executive is engaged in activity that violates
the terms of Section E. In such an arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall have the authority to award damages as appropriate.
However, given the difficulty of assessing damages for breaches of this Agreement, the Parties agree that, if the arbitrator finds
Executive violated this Agreement, the arbitrator must issue a damage award of, at minimum, $25,000. Each disclosure or transmission
of Protected Property shall constitute a separate violation and the minimum damage amount will apply to each violation. 

Executive s Initials  

Further, if Executive breaches or fails to honor any
provision in Section C or E of this Agreement, and Sucampo is successful in whole or in part in any legal or equitable action to
defend its right under or to enforce any terms of Section C or E, Executive agrees to reimburse Sucampo for Sucampo s costs,
expenses, and reasonable attorneys  fees associated with such action. In that event, the arbitrator will be obligated to
award Sucampo all its attorneys  fees and costs as part of the arbitrator s determination. Executive waives any defense
as to the validity of any liquidated damages stated in this Agreement on the grounds that such liquidated damages are void as penalties
or are not reasonably related to actual damages. 

2.                  
 Notwithstanding the language in Section F.1. above, under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive shall
not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that:
(a) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney;
and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made to Executive s
attorney in relation to a lawsuit for retaliation against Executive for reporting a suspected violation of law; or (c) is made
in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. 

G.   Sucampo Access.    

Executive agrees and consents
that, during the Term of this Agreement and thereafter, Sucampo may review, audit, intercept, review and disclose all messages
created, received or sent over the voice mail, electronic mail and Internet access systems provided by Sucampo, with or without
notice to Executive. Executive further consents and agrees that Sucampo may, at any time, access and review the contents of all
telephones and related systems, computers, computer disks, other data storage equipment and devices, files, desks, drawers, closets,
cabinets and work stations which are either on Sucampo s premises or which are owned or provided by Sucampo. Executive acknowledges
that Executive should have no expectation of privacy in any of the electronic communications systems or work areas described in
this paragraph. 

H.   Termination.    

1.                  
  Termination by Sucampo for Cause . Sucampo may terminate this Agreement and Executive s employment for Cause
(as defined below) by written notice with immediate effect. 

Cause  shall mean any of the following: 

(i)   
 the gross neglect, willful failure, or refusal of Executive to perform Executive's duties and/or responsibilities (other
than as a result of Executive's death or Disability); or 

(ii)   
 perpetration of an intentional and knowing fraud against or affecting the Company or any customer, supplier, client, agent
or employee thereof; or 

(iii)      
 any willful or intentional act that could reasonably be expected to injure the reputation, financial condition, business
or business relationships of the Company or Executive's reputation or business relationships, including but not limited to any
act that could subject Sucampo to legal liability (e.g. violation of Sucampo s policy prohibiting sexual harassment); or 

Executive s Initials  

(iv)   
 conviction (including conviction on a  nolo contendere  plea) of a felony or any crime involving fraud, dishonesty
or moral turpitude; or 

(v) the material breach by Executive of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section C or E); or 

(vi)     
 Executive s supervisor demonstrates he/she had  legitimate reasons  to conclude Executive failed or refused to
perform Executive s job duties and/or responsibilities at an acceptable level, within 30 days after Executive s supervisor
provided Executive with written notice detailing the specific (unacceptable) performance areas and/or behavior that Executive must
improve to remain employed; or 

(vii)     
 Executive refuses to execute a modified Agreement offered by Sucampo on the Anniversary Date of this Agreement that is in
compliance with Section A.2; as long as the modified Agreement does not make any unilateral changes to Section B.1 (protections
against deductions in the Executive s Base Salary), Section H (Termination for Cause/Termination Without Cause/Resignation
for Good Reason/Change of Control/Separation Benefits) or substantially change Section I (agreement to arbitrate). 

2.
                  Termination Other Than For Cause  .  

a.                   
  Termination Without Cause . Either party may terminate this Agreement and Executive's employment hereunder at any
time upon 30 days  prior written notice to the other party. Executive s employment and this Agreement shall terminate
at the end of the 30-day notice period. Sucampo may elect to provide Executive with 30 days' salary in lieu of Executive's continued
active employment during the notice period. 

b.
                    Resignation for Good Reason  .  

i.                    
 To resign for Good Reason, within 21 days of any event or condition that gives rise to Executive s belief that he/she
has Good Reason to resign, Executive must notify Sucampo in writing that Executive intends to resign for  Good Reason under
Section H.2.b  and state the reasons for Executive s belief he/she has reason to do so. Following receipt of such notice,
Sucampo will have 30 days (the  Cure Period ) to cure the issues identified by Executive. If, by the expiration of
the Cure Period, Sucampo has not cured the issues identified by Executive, and those issues meet the standard for Good Reason defined
below, Executive may resign for Good Reason. If Executive does not resign within 14 days following the Cure Period, Executive waives
any future right to resign for Good Reason based on the same reasons set forth in his/her 21 day letter. 

ii.                  
 As used herein,  Good Reason  is the same standard as  constructive discharge  in Maryland federal
employment law cases. More specifically, to resign for Good Reason, Executive must establish that Sucampo unilaterally made materially
significant change(s) to, or diminutions of, Executive s work environment, commute to work, terms, conditions; job duties,
responsibilities and/or overall status of his/her position, that rendered Executive s continued employment so  unbearable
that a reasonable person would resign.  

Executive s Initials  

iii.                
 Executive shall have the right to resign for Good Reason if Sucampo requires Executive to accept any unilateral change(s)
to Section A.2, Section B.1 (Base Salary), Section H (standards for termination/resignation/death and disability/separation benefits),
Section N (limits to unilateral changes), or any materially significant changes to Section I (Arbitration) of this Agreement at
any time including before, on or after the Anniversary Date. If Executive resigns under this subsection H.2.b.iii, Sucampo
shall pay Executive the Separation Benefits enumerated in Section H.2.d without any obligation to meet the constructive discharge
standard for Good Reason set forth above in Section H.2.b.ii. In addition, if Executive resigns because Sucampo or its successor
makes unilateral changes to this Agreement to prepare for or within 12 months following a Change in Control, that qualify
as Good Reason under this Section H.2.b.iii, Sucampo and/or its successor shall pay Executive the  Change in Control Benefits 
enumerated below in Section H.3.b  instead of  the Separation Benefits in Section H.2.d. 

iv.                
 If Executive provides notice that he/she is resigning for Good Reason, Sucampo reserves the right to accept Executive s
resignation immediately, end the Agreement, release Executive from employment immediately or at any time during the Cure Period,
and pay Executive s Base Salary during the remaining Cure Period, up to a maximum of 

 30 days. By electing to do so, Sucampo does not concede that Executive
has met the condition(s) to resign for Good Reason defined above. 

c.                   
  Death or Disability . If Executive dies, this Agreement and Executive's employment shall terminate automatically.
If Executive has or develops a disability that affects Executive s ability to work, Sucampo shall explore options with Executive
to determine whether Executive is able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.
In the event of any dispute as to whether Employee is disabled for purposes of this Section H.2.c., such dispute shall be resolved
by an independent physician competent to assess the condition at issue selected by Sucampo and performing such assessment at Sucampo s
expense. Upon termination of this Agreement due to Executive s death or disability, Sucampo shall provide Executive (or Executive s
estate, as applicable) with all of Executive s compensation and benefits that had fully accrued or fully vested as of the
date this Agreement terminated. No other compensation or benefits of any nature shall accrue, vest or continue after the effective
date the Agreement is terminated, except as provided under paragraph d. immediately below. 

d.                  
  Separation Benefits . If Sucampo terminates Executive s employment without meeting the conditions for  Termination
for Cause  in Section H.1; if Executive resigns for Good Reason under the conditions set forth in Section H.2.b, or due to
the Executive s  Death or Disability  under Section H.2.c; and Executive (or the executor of Executive s
estate upon death or incapacity) signs and returns to Sucampo without revocation a release prepared by Sucampo of all legally waivable
claims related to or arising from Executive s employment with Sucampo and all other terms determined exclusively by Sucampo,
then (i) Sucampo shall pay Executive (or the estate): (A) the amount of any COBRA continuation premium payments made by Executive
during the 12-month period following the date of termination, or the period ending when Executive becomes eligible for comparable
group medical benefits coverage from another source (whichever comes first); and (B) a lump sum payment equal to 12 months of Executive s
then-current annual Base Salary, to be made not later than 60 days following Executive s date of 

Executive s Initials  

termination; and (ii) Executive s Equity Incentive Awards shall vest
as set forth in Section H.5 (collectively, the  Separation Benefits ). 

3.
                  Termination in Connection with Change In Control  .  

a.                   
 This Agreement terminates if it is not assumed by the successor corporation (or affiliate thereto) upon a Change in Control
(as defined below). 

Change in Control 
means: (i) the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of the voting securities
of Sucampo ; (ii) Sucampo is the non-surviving party in a merger; (iii) Sucampo sells all or substantially all of its assets, provided,
that no  Change in Control  shall be deemed to have occurred merely as the result of a refinancing by Sucampo or as
a result of Sucampo s insolvency or the appointment of a conservator; or (iv) the Board of Directors of Sucampo, in its sole
and absolute discretion, determines that there has been a sufficient change in the share ownership or ownership of the voting power
of Sucampo s voting securities to constitute a change of effective ownership or control of Sucampo. 

b.                  
 If, in advance of the closing or within 12 months following the occurrence of a Change in Control of Sucampo, this Agreement
is terminated other than for Cause, and Executive signs and returns to Sucampo without revocation a release prepared by Sucampo
of all legally waivable claims related to or arising from Executive s employment with Sucampo and all other terms determined
exclusively by Sucampo, then (i) Sucampo shall pay Executive: (A) the amount of any COBRA continuation premium payments made by
Executive during the 18- month period following the Date of Termination, or the period ending when Executive becomes eligible for
comparable group medical benefits coverage from another source (whichever comes first) and (B) a lump sum payment equal to the
sum of (1) 18 months of Executive s then-current annual Base Salary and (2) 150% of the current target bonus percentage of
the Executive s current annual Base Salary, to be made not later than 60 days following Executive s date of termination;
and (ii) Executive s Equity Incentive Awards shall vest as set forth in Section H.5 (collectively, the  Change in Control
Benefits ). 

c.                   
 If within 12 months following a Change in Control, there is a material diminution of Executive s role in the company,
material diminution of status, or diminution of reporting structure, Executive shall have the right to resign and receive the Change
in Control Benefits enumerated in Section H.3.b. without being required to satisfy the standard for Good Reason defined in Section
H.2.b.ii. 

4.
                 Timing Of Payments  .  

a.                   
 Sucampo shall, only to the extent necessary, modify the
timing of delivery of the Separation Benefits or the Change in Control Benefits to Executive if Sucampo reasonably determines that
the timing would subject such Benefit to any additional tax or interest assessed under IRC Section 409A. In such event, the payments
shall be made as soon as practicable without causing the Benefit to trigger such additional tax or interest under Section 409A
of the IRC. If any amount of the Benefit becomes constitutes  nonqualified deferred compensation  within the meaning
of Section 409A, payment of such amount shall not commence until Executive incurs a  separation from service  within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 

Executive s Initials  

1.409A-1(h). If, at the time of Executive s separation
from service, Executive is a  specified employee  (under IRC Section 409A), any benefit as to which Section 409A penalties
could be assessed that becomes payable to Executive on account of Executive s  separation from service  (including
any amounts payable pursuant to the preceding sentence) shall be paid, without interest thereon, on the date six months and one
day after such separation from service. 

b.                  
 Prior to paying any Change in Control Benefit, Sucampo shall cause its independent auditors promptly to review, at Sucampo's
sole expense, the applicability to those payments of Sections 280G and 4999 of the IRC. If the auditors determine that any payment
of the Change in Control Benefit would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the IRC or any interest or penalties
with respect to such excise tax, then such payment owed to Executive shall be reduced by an amount calculated to provide to Executive
the maximum Change in Control Benefits which will not trigger application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the IRC, with any such reduction
being made last with respect to benefits that are not exempt from IRC  409A. 

5.
                 Effect Of Termination On Equity Incentive Awards  .  

a.                   
 If this Agreement is terminated other than by Sucampo for Cause, any unvested Equity Incentive Awards that have a duration
vesting condition as defined in the Stock Agreement shall immediately vest to the extent such unvested Equity Incentive Awards
would have vested in the 12 months from the date of termination; or 

b.                  
 If Sucampo is acquired or is the non-surviving party in a merger, or Sucampo sells all of its assets, and in advance of
the closing of such transaction or within 12 months thereafter, this Agreement is terminated other than for Cause, any unvested
Equity Incentive Awards that have a duration vesting condition as defined in the Stock Agreement shall immediately vest and any
unvested Equity Incentive Awards with a performance condition shall immediately vest and may be exercised only to the extent the
performance targets have been achieved or would be achieved by such acquisition, merger or sale in accordance with the terms of
the Plan and the Stock Agreement. 

c.        
 If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with a provision of the Stock Agreement and/or the Plan, the provision more
favorable to the Executive shall govern. 

6.                  
  No Further Compensation . Executive shall receive all compensation and benefits provided to Executive by Sucampo that
fully accrued and fully vested before the date of termination of this Agreement. No other compensation or benefits of any nature
provided by Sucampo shall continue, accrue or vest after the date of termination, except as provided under the terms of any Sucampo
benefits plan in which Executive is enrolled as of the date of termination. 

I.   Arbitration.    

1.                  
 Executive and Sucampo agree to resolve by arbitration any and all disputes arising from or relating to Executive s
employment with Sucampo, Executive s application for 

Executive s Initials

promissory estoppel), or tort claims; 

d.

plan which specifies that its claims procedure shall culminate in an arbitration procedure different from this one, or is underwritten
by a commercial insurer which decides such claims. 

2.                 Covered Disputes do not
include: (a) claims for workers' compensation benefits; (b) claims for unemployment compensation benefits; (c) claims based
upon Sucampo's current (successor or future) stock option plans, employee pension and/or welfare benefit plans if those plans
contain some form of a grievance, arbitration, or other procedure for the resolution of disputes under the plan; and (d)
claims by law which are not subject to mandatory binding pre- dispute arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act,
such as claims under the Dodd-Frank Act. 

3.                  
 Executive agrees that, if Sucampo terminates the Agreement for Cause and an arbitrator later determines that Sucampo did
not have Cause to terminate the Agreement, then the remedy awarded to Executive shall be limited to such compensation and benefits
as Executive would have received in the event of Executive's termination other than for Cause at the same time as the original
termination. 

4.                  
 Executive affirms that Executive has been provided with a copy of Sucampo s Arbitration Procedures, and has had an
opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedures, to seek counsel, and has read, understands and accepts them. By signing
below, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that Sucampo has the unilateral right to amend its arbitration procedures from time
to time as long as the underlying procedures provide similar access to the arbitration process 

J.                  
   Executive s R epresenta tions .   Executive represents to Sucampo that Executive has no obligations to any
other person or entity that conflict with the Executive s obligations under this Agreement. Executive further represents
that, to the extent Executive has disclosed information to Sucampo, created any original materials or used any proprietary information
in consulting, working or rendering services with, for or to Sucampo, Executive has the right to do so, and such actions shall
not violate any privacy, proprietary or other rights of others.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the United States
and the State of Maryland, without regard to its choice of law provisions. 

L.   Severability.    

If any term of this Agreement
is declared unenforceable, the decision-maker of competent jurisdiction shall interpret or modify this Agreement, to the extent
necessary, for it to be enforceable. If any term of this Agreement is declared unenforceable and cannot be modified to be enforceable,
such term or provision shall immediately become null and void, leaving the remainder of this Agreement in full force and effect.

By signing below, Executive confirms that Executive
understands Sucampo does not enter into any oral agreements with any personnel.

inducements, agreements or understandings between the Parties regarding such topics. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of Sucampo, its successors and assigns, without the need for further agreement or consent by Executive. If Sucampo

shall not automatically be terminated, and Sucampo agrees to use its best efforts to ensure that the transferee or surviving company
shall assume and be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. The failure of either party to enforce any of the provisions in
this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of that party to enforce any such provision.

 During the term of this Agreement, the Agreement may not be modified, altered or changed, except through a writing signed

employ Executive at-will without an employment agreement, or either party may end Executive s employment under the terms
of Section H.

Exhibit 10.6  

AMENDED AND RESTATED EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT  

This Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement
(the  Agreement ) is made by and between Sucampo AG, Baarerstrasse 22, 6300 Zug, ( Sucampo ), and Peter
Lichtlen ( Executive ), and amends, restates and supersedes the Employment Agreement between Sucampo and Executive
dated October 21, 2014. 

A.        Employment and Duties.   

1.       
 Sucampo shall employ Executive as its Chief Medical Officer. While employed by Sucampo, Executive shall devote Executive s
full-time work efforts exclusively on behalf of Sucampo and shall not perform work of any nature for compensation of any kind for
any person or entity other than for Sucampo, unless approved in writing and signed by Sucampo s CEO. 

2.       
 This Agreement shall be in effect for an indefinite period of time, following the first date on which both Executive and
Sucampo have signed the Agreement (the  Anniversary Date ). The Agreement can be terminated by either party pursuant
to Section H. 

3.      
 Sucampo hereby consents to Executive acting as a non-operative member of the board of directors of Numab AG, as organized
under the laws of Switzerland, and be entitled to advise Numab AG; provided, however, that Numab AG's activity remains limited
to development of therapeutic biologicals, in particular antibody-based drugs. Executive has represented that he does not and will
not receive any financial compensation for his directorship with Numab AG and will only act in a strategic role. This strategic
role will not affect Executive's full commitment to Sucampo in any way and the time requirement for the Numab AG role will be,
on average, no more than one hour per week. In addition, Sucampo hereby consents to Executive acting as the VP Clinical Development
for Numab AG, on the terms and conditions described in the letter, dated December 17, 2015, from Sucampo to Executive attached
hereto as Exhibit 2. Prior to giving any advice to Numab AG on any new project (molecular target, indication if known), Executive
shall obtain the prior written consent of Sucampo. Executive shall obtain Numab AG's prior authorization to disclose the new projects
and Sucampo shall keep all information on such projects strictly confidential. During the time Executive works for Sucampo, he
shall not have any duties or responsibilities regarding any interest or work that Sucampo may express or actually perform in or
with Numab AG. Executive shall not provide Numab AG any information whatsoever that Executive comes in contact with in any form
while employed by Sucampo that has anything to do with Sucampo s interest in or work with Numab AG. 

B.      Compensation and Benefits.  

1.        Base Salary . Sucampo shall pay Executive an annual base salary of Three Hundred Fifty-Seven Thousand Three Hundred Twenty-Eight

Executive s Initials

F.        Breach of Obligations of Confidentiality, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.  

1.        Executive acknowledges that any threatened or actual breach of Section C or E of 

Executive s Initials  

this Agreement may
cause irreparable harm to Sucampo, for which money damages would be inadequate to compensate Sucampo. Consequently, in the event
of a breach or threatened breach of Section C or E of this Agreement,  and in addition to any remedy that may be contained
in any other agreement, the Executive shall pay to Sucampo liquidated damages in an amount of CHF 25'000 per case and event. Payment
of liquidated damages does not exempt the Executive from adhering to his obligations under sections C and E. Sucampo's right to
claim compensation for damages and financial loss arising out of or relating to such breach, and exceeding the amount of liquidated
damages, is expressly reserved. Independently of the foregoing rights, Sucampo (i) may request that the Executive cease any violation
of the obligations set out in sections C and E, and (ii) may seek court orders, including interim orders (Realvollstreckung), prohibiting
such breaching activity.  Each disclosure or transmission of Protected Property shall constitute a
separate violation liquidated damages will apply to each violation. Further, if Executive breaches or fails to honor any provision
in Section C or E of this Agreement, and Sucampo is successful in whole or in part in any legal or equitable action to defend its
right under or to enforce any terms of Section C or E, Executive agrees to reimburse Sucampo for Sucampo s costs, expenses,
and reasonable attorneys  fees associated with such action. Executive waives any defense as to the validity of any liquidated
damages stated in this Agreement on the grounds that such liquidated damages are void as penalties, are not reasonably related

and absolute discretion, determines that there has been a sufficient change in the share ownership or ownership of the voting power
of Sucampo s voting securities to constitute a change of effective ownership or control of Sucampo. 

b.          
 If, in advance of the closing or within 12 months following the occurrence of a Change in Control of Sucampo, this Agreement
is terminated other than for Cause, and Executive signs and returns to Sucampo without revocation a release prepared by Sucampo
of all 

Executive s Initials  

legally waivable claims related to or arising from
Executive s employment with Sucampo and all other terms determined exclusively by Sucampo, then (i) Sucampo shall pay Executive:
(A) a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (1) 18 months of Executive s then-current annual Base Salary (including the Base
Salary from date when notice of termination was given up to the date of termination of Executive's employment) and (2) 150% of
the current target bonus percentage of the Executive s current annual Base Salary, to be made not later than 60 days following
Executive s date of termination; and (ii) Executive s Equity Incentive Awards shall vest as set forth in Section H.5
(collectively, the  Change in Control Benefits ). 

c.          
 If within 12 months following a Change in Control, there is a material diminution of Executive s role in the company,
material diminution of status, or diminution of reporting structure, Executive shall have the right to resign and receive the Change
in Control Benefits enumerated in Section H.3.b. without being required to satisfy the standard for Good Reason defined in Section
H.2.b.ii. 

3.       
  Withholding; Timing Of Payments . Sucampo shall deduct from the Separation Benefits or Change in Control Benefits
the applicable Executive's portion of social security charges and other charges due under applicable law. Sucampo shall, only to
the extent necessary, modify the timing of delivery of the Separation Benefits or the Change in Control Benefits to Executive if
Sucampo reasonably determines that the timing would subject such Benefit to any additional tax or interest assessed under applicable
laws. 

4.        Effect
Of Termination On Equity Incentive Awards  .  

a.         
 If this Agreement is terminated other than by Sucampo for Cause, any unvested Equity Incentive Awards that have a duration
vesting condition as defined in the Stock Agreement shall immediately vest to the extent such unvested Equity Incentive Awards
would have vested in the 12 months from the date of termination; or 

b.         
 If Sucampo is acquired or is the non-surviving party in a merger, or Sucampo sells all of its assets, and in advance of
the closing of such transaction or within 12 months thereafter, this Agreement is terminated other than for Cause, any unvested
Equity Incentive Awards that have a duration vesting condition as defined in the Stock Agreement shall immediately vest and any
unvested Equity Incentive Awards with a performance condition shall immediately vest and may be exercised only to the extent the
performance targets have been achieved or would be achieved by such acquisition, merger or sale in accordance with the terms of
the Plan and the Stock Agreement. 

c.        
 If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with a provision of the Stock Agreement and/or the Plan, the provision more
favorable to the Executive shall govern. 

5.       
  No Further Compensation . Executive shall receive
all compensation and benefits provided to Executive by Sucampo that fully accrued and fully vested before the date of termination
of this Agreement. No other compensation or benefits of any nature provided by Sucampo shall continue, accrue or vest after the
date of termination, except as provided under the terms of any Sucampo benefits plan in which Executive is enrolled as of the date
of termination. 

Executive s Initials  

6.       
  Retirement Age . This Agreement terminates without notice and without any severance being due at the end of the month
on which the Executive reached the ordinary retirement age. 

7.       
  Release Period . The Company has at any time the right to relieve Executive from his obligation to work at full pay
provided, however, that any income that Executive receives from any activity during such release period shall be deducted. Executive
shall compensate any vacation during such release period and shall not engage in any competing activity. 

I.        [Section intentionally left blank.] 

J.      
  Executive s Representations.   Executive represents to Sucampo that Executive has no obligations to any other
person or entity that conflict with the Executive s obligations under this Agreement. Executive further represents that,
to the extent Executive has disclosed information to Sucampo, created any original materials or used any proprietary information
in consulting, working or rendering services with, for or to Sucampo, Executive has the right to do so, and such actions shall
not violate any privacy, proprietary or other rights of others. 

K.       Choice of Law.  

This Agreement is governed by Swiss law. 

L.       Severability.  

If any term of this Agreement
is declared unenforceable, the decision-maker of competent jurisdiction shall interpret or modify this Agreement, to the extent
necessary, for it to be enforceable. If any term of this Agreement is declared unenforceable and cannot be modified to be enforceable,
such term or provision shall immediately become null and void, leaving the remainder of this Agreement in full force and effect. 

M.       No Oral Agreements.  

By signing below, Executive confirms that Executive understands
Sucampo does not enter into any oral agreements with any personnel. 

N.      Entire Agreement; Amendment.  

1.       
 This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between the Parties concerning the topics addressed in this Agreement. This
Agreement fully supersedes the Employment Agreement between the parties dated October 21, 2014 and any other prior oral or written
inducements, agreements or understandings between the Parties regarding such topics. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of Sucampo, its successors and assigns, without the need for further agreement or consent by Executive. If Sucampo
is acquired during the Term, or is the non-surviving party in a merger, or sells all or substantially all of its assets, 

Executive s Initials  

this Agreement shall not automatically be terminated,
and Sucampo agrees to use its best efforts to ensure that the transferee or surviving company shall assume and be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement. The failure of either party to enforce any of the provisions in this Agreement shall not be construed
to be a waiver of the right of that party to enforce any such provision. 

2.       
 During the term of this Agreement, the Agreement may not be modified, altered or changed, except through a writing signed
by both Parties. 

O.       Notices.

in a written instrument given by personal delivery, air courier or registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, addressed to such party at the address set forth below or such other address as may thereafter be designated in a written

Re: Modification of Work Arrangement  

Dear Peter, 

You have informed me of your desire to assume responsibilities,
beginning April 1, 2016, as VP Clinical Development at Numab AG, a company engaged in the development of antibody-based products
in the field of Immunology, Oncology, Inflammatory Diseases, and Metabolic Diseases. 

We understand that your engagement on behalf of Numab is expected
to be intermittent in nature, and that you expect to be able to fully discharge your responsibilities as Sucampo's Chief Medical
Officer consistent with your current level of engagement on behalf of Sucampo. Based on Numab's current business and these expectations,
we agree that your proposed engagement at Numab is compatible with your employment agreement, including Section 7.1 (Duties of
Loyalty) and Section 10 (Non-Competition), and we hereby consent to your engagement at Numab without change to your compensation
received under your employment agreement with Sucampo. 

It is our shared understanding and agreement that this arrangement
will be formally reviewed by you and your direct supervisor on a quarterly basis. Sucampo reserves the right to withdraw its consent
to your engagement at Numab at any time with 30 days' prior notice for any or no reason.
