   PREFORMED LINE PRODUCTS COMPANY   
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (UNAUDITED)      (In thousands, except
share and per share data, unless specifically noted)     NOTE A   BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Preformed Line Products Company and subsidiaries (the  Company  or  PLPC )
have been prepared in accordance with United States of America (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  
 The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements contain all estimates and adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring accruals, required to fairly present the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full-year ending December 31, 2016.    The Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from
the audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes to
consolidated financial statements included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 11, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
  Reclassifications     Certain prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to current year presentation, as discussed in Note K segment information.    NOTE B   OTHER FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION
    Inventories   net       
   Cost of inventories for certain material is determined using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method and totaled approximately
$29.0 million at September 30, 2016 and $26.8 million at December 31, 2015. An actual valuation of inventories under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of the year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly,
interim LIFO calculations are based on management s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs. Because these estimates are subject to change and may be different than the actual inventory levels and costs at the end of the year,
interim results are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net change in LIFO inventories resulted in a $.2 million and $.3 million benefit to Income before income
taxes, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the net change in LIFO inventories resulted in a $.4 million benefit to Income before income taxes for each period.

  Noncurrent inventory is included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
  Property, plant and equipment net     Major classes of
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and were as follows:      
    Legal proceedings     From
time to time, the Company may be subject to litigation incidental to its business. The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that the Company believes would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.    NOTE C   PENSION PLANS  
 The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the Preformed Line Products Company Employees  Retirement Plan (the  Plan ). Net
periodic benefit cost for this plan included the following components:      
   The Company made $1.0 million in contributions to the Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company
does not anticipate contributing additional funding to the Plan in 2016.    NOTE D   ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ( AOCI )  
 The following tables set forth the total changes in AOCI by component, net of tax:  
      8  

Table of Contents  

(a) 
 This AOCI component is included in the computation of net periodic pension costs.      NOTE E   COMPUTATION
OF EARNINGS PER SHARE    Basic earnings per share were computed by dividing Net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for each
respective period. Diluted earnings per share were calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted-average of all potentially dilutive common stock that was outstanding during the periods presented.  
 The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:  
   
   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, 47,850 and 55,350 stock options, respectively, were excluded from
the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, 59,750 and 51,850 stock options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss
per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.  
      9  

Table of Contents  

  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, there were no restricted
share units excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.    NOTE F   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES  
 The Company s finite and indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of the following:  
   
   The aggregate amortization expense for other intangibles with finite lives for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $.3 million and $.8 million, respectively. The aggregate amortization expense for the other intangibles with finite lives for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $.3 million and $.9 million,
respectively. Amortization expense is estimated to be $.3 million for the remaining period of 2016, $1.0 million annually for 2017, 2018 and 2019 and $.9 million for 2020. The weighted-average remaining amortization period is approximately 17.7
years. The weighted-average remaining amortization period by intangible asset class is as follows: patents, 9.3 years; land use rights, 58.5 years; trademarks, 9.6 years; technology, 15.1 years; and customer relationships, 13.3 years.  
 The Company s measurement date for its annual impairment test for goodwill is October 1st of each year. The Company performs its annual impairment
test for goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology, market comparables, and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit. The Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit
with its carrying value to assess if goodwill has been impaired. Based on the assumptions as to growth, discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology, results of the valuations could be significantly different.
However, the Company believes that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units.    The
Company s only intangible asset with an indefinite life is goodwill. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, by segment, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are as follows:

  NOTE G   SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  
  The 1999 Stock Option Plan     Activity in the Company s
1999 Stock Option Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows:      
   There were 6,450 and 0 Stock options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was less than $.1 million. Cash received for the exercise of stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $.2
million.    The Company recorded no compensation expense related to stock options for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as all options
were fully vested.     Long Term Incentive Plan of 2008 and 2016 Incentive Plan   
 The Company maintains an equity award program to give the Company a competitive advantage in attracting, retaining, and motivating officers, employees and
directors and to provide an incentive to those individuals to increase shareholder value through long-term incentives directly linked to the Company s performance. Under the Preformed Line Products Company Long Term Incentive Plan of 2008 (the
 LTIP ), certain employees, officers, and directors were eligible to receive awards of options, restricted shares and restricted share units (RSUs). The total number of Company common shares reserved for awards under the LTIP was 900,000,
of which 800,000 common shares were reserved for RSUs and 100,000 common shares have been reserved for share options. The LTIP was terminated and replaced with the Preformed Line Products Company 2016 Incentive Plan (the  Incentive Plan )
in May 2016 upon approval by the Company s Shareholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 10, 2016. No further awards will be made under the LTIP and previously granted awards remain outstanding in accordance with their
terms. Under the Incentive Plan, certain employees, officers, and directors will be eligible to receive awards of options, restricted shares and RSUs. The total number of Company common shares reserved for awards under the Incentive Plan is
1,000,000 of which 900,000 common shares have been reserved for restricted share awards and 100,000 common shares have been reserved for share options. As of September 30, 2016, no options or restricted shares have been granted under the
Incentive Plan. The Incentive Plan expires on May 10, 2026.     Restricted Share Units   
 For the regular annual grants, a portion of the RSUs is subject to time-based cliff vesting and a portion is subject to vesting based upon the Company s
performance over a set period for all participants except the CEO. All of the CEO s regular annual RSUs are subject to vesting based upon the Company s performance over a three-year period.  
 The RSUs are offered at no cost to the employees; however, the participant must remain employed with the Company until the restrictions on the RSUs lapse. The
fair value of RSUs is based on the market price of a common share on the grant date. The Company currently estimates that the only time-based RSUs to be forfeited are those from the 2015 and 2016 grants due to the retirement of the Company s
Chief Financial Officer in May 2017. Dividends declared are accrued in cash.  
      11  

Table of Contents  

  A summary of the RSUs outstanding under the LTIP for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:
     
   For time-based RSUs, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period of the award in General and administrative expense in the accompanying Statements of Consolidated Income. Compensation expense related to the time-based RSUs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $.1 million
and $.2 million, respectively. Compensation expense related to the time-based RSUs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $.1 million and $.2 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, there was $.4 million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to time-based RSUs that is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining period of approximately 1.8 years.  
 For the performance-based RSUs, the number of RSUs in which the participants will vest depends on the Company s level of performance measured by growth
in pre-tax income and sales growth over a requisite performance period. Depending on the extent to which the performance criterions are satisfied under the LTIP, the participants are eligible to earn common shares over the vesting period.
Performance-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $.3 million and $.6 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, a $.1 million increase in
performance-based compensation expense and $.2 million reduction in performance-based compensation expense was recorded related to the 2015 performance-based RSU grant, due to changes in estimates for growth in sales and operating income.
Performance-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was income of $1.0 million and $.8 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, a $.8 million and $.8 million reduction,
respectively, in performance-based compensation expense was recorded related to the 2013 performance-based RSU grant, due to changes in estimates for growth in sales. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, a $.6 million and
$1.2 million reduction, respectively, in performance-based compensation expense was recorded related to the 2014 performance-based RSU grant, due to changes in estimates for growth in sales and pre-tax income. As of September 30, 2016, the
remaining performance-based RSUs compensation expense of $2.0 million is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 2.1 years.    The excess
tax benefits from time and performance-based RSUs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was less than $.1 million for each period, as reported on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows in financing activities, and represents
the reduction in income taxes otherwise payable during the period, attributable to the actual gross tax benefits in excess of the expected tax benefits for RSUs vested in the current period.  
 In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the LTIP), vesting of the RSUs will be accelerated and all restrictions will lapse. Unvested
performance-based awards are based on a target potential payout. Actual shares awarded at the end of the performance period may be less than the target potential payout level depending on achievement of performance-based award objectives.  
 To satisfy the vesting of its RSU awards, the Company has reserved new shares from its authorized but unissued shares. Any additional awards granted will also
be issued from the Company s authorized but unissued shares.

   Share Option Awards   
 The LTIP plan permitted the grant of 100,000 options to buy common shares of the Company to certain employees at not less than fair market value of the shares
on the date of grant. Options issued to date under the LTIP vest 50% after one year following the date of the grant, 75% after two years, and 100% after three years, and expire from five to ten years from the date of grant. Shares issued as a result
of stock option exercises will be funded with the issuance of new shares.    The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating fair
values of options. The Black-Scholes model requires assumptions regarding the volatility of the Company s stock, the expected life of the stock award and the Company s dividend yield. The Company utilizes historical data in determining
these assumptions. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. zero coupon Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. Forfeitures have been estimated to be zero.  
 There were 0 and 2,000 options granted for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 The fair value for the stock options granted in 2015 was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions:    The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2015 was $11.78.  
   
   Activity in the Company s LTIP for nine months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows:  
   
   There were 1,000 and 0 stock options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was less than $.1 million. Cash received for the exercise of stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was less than
$.1 million.    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded compensation expense related to the stock options
currently vested of less than $.1 million and $.1 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded compensation expense related to the stock options currently vested of less than $.1 million
and $.2 million, respectively. The total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized at September 30, 2016 is expected to be $.2 million over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years.

   Deferred Compensation Plan   
 The Company maintains a trust, commonly referred to as a rabbi trust, in connection with the Company s deferred compensation plan. This plan allows for
two deferrals. First, Directors make elective deferrals of Director fees payable and held in the rabbi trust. The deferred compensation plan allows the Directors to elect to receive Director fees in common shares of the Company at a later date
instead of fees paid each quarter in cash. Second, this plan allows certain Company employees to defer LTIP restricted shares or RSUs for future distribution in the form of common shares. Assets of the rabbi trust are consolidated, and the value of
the Company s common shares held in the rabbi trust is classified in Shareholders  equity and generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock. The Company recognizes the original amount of the deferred compensation (fair
value of the deferred stock award at the date of grant) as the basis for recognition in common shares issued to the rabbi trust. Changes in the fair value of amounts owed to certain employees or Directors are not recognized as the Company s
deferred compensation plan does not permit diversification and must be settled by the delivery of a fixed number of the Company s common shares. As of September 30, 2016, 297,281 shares have been deferred and are being held in the rabbi
trust.    NOTE H   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  
 The carrying value of the Company s current financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes
payable, and short-term debt, approximates its fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. At September 30, 2016, the fair value of the Company s long-term debt was estimated using discounted cash flow analysis
based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements which are considered to be Level 2 inputs. There have been no transfers in or out of Level 2 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016. Based on the analysis performed, the carrying value of the Company s long-term debt approximates fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
 NOTE I   RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    In
November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  which requires that deferred tax liabilities and
assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Prior to the issuance of the standard, deferred tax liabilities and assets were required to be separately classified into a current amount and a noncurrent amount in the balance
sheet. The new accounting guidance represents a change in accounting principle and the standard is required to be adopted in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and the Company elected to early adopt
this guidance as of March 31, 2016 and to apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2015, the Company reclassified the prior period amount of $8.6 million related to its deferred tax
assets and $.2 million related to its deferred tax liabilities from current to noncurrent, resulting in an increase of $7.4 million to its noncurrent deferred tax assets and a decrease of $1.0 million to its noncurrent deferred income tax
liabilities. Because the application of this guidance affects classification only, such reclassifications did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of its operations.  
 NOTE J   NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED    In March
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 provides guidance in GAAP for the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company is required to adopt ASU 2016-09 for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning
of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating what impact, if any, its adoption will have to the presentation of
the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
      14  

Table of Contents  

  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  The amendments in this Update
require the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the
underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation. Both the asset and liability will initially be measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Subsequent measurement, including
the presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a finance or an operating lease. Initial costs directly attributable to negotiating and arranging the lease will be included in the asset. For
leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee can make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize an asset and corresponding liability. Lessees will also be required to provide additional qualitative and
quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures are intended to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements and provide additional information about the
nature of an organization s leasing activities. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating what impact, if any, its adoption will have to the presentation of the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In July
2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  The amendments in this Update more closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of
business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an
interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating what impact, if any, its adoption will have to the presentation of the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  or ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 requires an
entity to recognize revenue in a matter that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve
that core principle, the amendment provides five steps that an entity should apply when recognizing revenue. The amendment also specifies the accounting of some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands the disclosure
requirements around contracts with customers. An entity can either adopt this amendment retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of
initial application. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 deferring the effective date of the amendment to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating what impact, if any, its
adoption will have to the presentation of the Company s consolidated financial statements.    NOTE K   SEGMENT INFORMATION  
 The following tables present a summary of the Company s reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.
Financial results for the PLP-USA segment include the elimination of all segments  intercompany profit in inventory. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company reconfigured a product line in The Americas segment and consolidated its
manufacturing processes into the PLP-USA segment. As such, prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

NOTE L   INCOME TAXES    The
Company s effective tax rate was 27% and 90% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 27% and 45% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% was primarily due to an increase in earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, where such
earnings are permanently reinvested, coupled with the recognition of favorable discrete items, primarily a $.4 million release of valuation allowance in the Asia Pacific region and a $.2 million reversal of unrecognized tax benefits for the
expiration of statutes of limitation. The lower effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same periods for 2015 was primarily due to an increase in earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates
than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, where such earnings are permanently reinvested coupled with the recognition of favorable discrete items, primarily a $.4 million release of valuation allowance in the Asia Pacific region and a $.2 million
reversal of unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of statutes of limitation. The effective rate for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was not meaningful primarily due to the amount, timing and mix of earnings by
jurisdiction and the reversal of losses in certain jurisdictions where no tax benefit was recognized in 2015, partially offset by an increase in earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate where such earnings
are permanently reinvested.

  As described in Note I, the Company elected to early adopt FASB guidance ASU 2015-17  Income Taxes  
Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  as of March 31, 2016 and to apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented related to the classification of current and noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accordingly, as of December 31, 2015, the Company reclassified the prior period amount of $8.6 million related to its deferred tax asset and $.2 million related to its deferred tax liability from current to noncurrent, resulting in an increase
of $7.4 million to the Company s noncurrent deferred tax asset and a decrease of $1.0 million to its noncurrent deferred income tax liability.    The
Company provides valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company recognized a $.4 million benefit for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 due to release of valuation allowance in the Asia Pacific Region.    As of September 30, 2016, the Company had gross
unrecognized tax benefits of $0 million. Under the provisions of ASC 740 Income Taxes, the Company reduced previously unrecognized tax benefits by $.2 million primarily due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. The Company does
not anticipate any material changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.    NOTE M   PRODUCT WARRANTY RESERVE  
 The Company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs to Costs of products sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These amounts are recorded
in Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company records and accounts for its warranty reserve based on specific claim incidents. Should the Company become aware of a specific potential warranty claim for
which liability is probable and reasonably estimable, a specific charge is recorded and accounted for accordingly. Adjustments are made quarterly to the accruals as claim information changes.  
 The following is a rollforward of the product warranty reserve:      
   NOTE N   CHARGES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES  
 During the year ended December 2015, the Company reconfigured one of its operations within its Asia Pacific segment by reducing its workforce and manufacturing
facilities while outsourcing production predominantly to its locations with lower cost operations. This was done in response to a slowdown in economic activity in the region as well as continued downward market pressure on prices. Additionally, the
Company reduced the number of personnel and facilities in the PLP-USA segment in response to downward market pressure on prices. Both of these actions reduced infrastructure and manufacturing costs. There was $.1 million and $2.7 million of expense
recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for these restructuring activities. The restructuring liability remaining at September 30, 2016 of $.6 million was recorded in Accrued expenses.

New Accounting Standards to be Adopted      OVERVIEW  
 Preformed Line Products Company (the  Company ,  PLPC ,  we ,  us , or  our ) was incorporated in Ohio in
1947. We are an international designer and manufacturer of products and systems employed in the construction and maintenance of overhead and underground networks for the energy, telecommunication, cable operators, information (data communication),
and other similar industries. Our primary products support, protect, connect, terminate, and secure cables and wires. We also provide solar hardware systems, mounting hardware for a variety of solar power applications, and fiber optic and copper
splice closures. PLPC is respected around the world for quality, dependability and market-leading customer service. Our goal is to continue to achieve profitable growth as a leader in the research, innovation, development, manufacture, and marketing
of technically advanced products and services related to energy, communications and cable systems and to take advantage of this leadership position to sell additional quality products in familiar markets. We have 29 sales and manufacturing
operations in 17 different countries.    We report our segments in four geographic regions: PLP-USA (including corporate), The Americas (includes operations
in North and South America without PLP-USA), EMEA (Europe, Middle East   Africa) and Asia-Pacific in accordance with accounting standards codified in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280,
Segment Reporting. Each segment distributes a full range of our primary products. Our PLP-USA segment is comprised of our U.S. operations, which manufacture our traditional products primarily supporting our domestic energy, telecommunications and
solar products. Our other three segments, The Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific, support our energy, telecommunications, data communication and solar products in each respective geographical region.  
 The segment managers responsible for each region report directly to the Company s Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, and
are accountable for the financial results and performance of their entire segment for which they are responsible. The business components within each segment are managed to maximize the results of the entire operating segment and Company rather than
the results of any individual business component of the segment.    We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on several factors
primarily based on sales and net income.

  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  
 In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reconfigured a product line in The Americas segment and consolidated its manufacturing processes into the PLP-USA segment
operations. This action reduced infrastructure and manufacturing costs for the product line. As a result, certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 segment financial results to be comparable to the 2016 financial results for The Americas
and PLP-USA reporting segments.    PREFACE    Our consolidated
financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our discussions of the financial results include non-GAAP measures (e.g., foreign currency impact) to provide additional information
concerning our financial results and provide information that we believe is useful to the readers of our consolidated financial statements in the assessment of our performance and operating trends.  
 Our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. As foreign
currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar, our sales and costs decrease as the foreign currency-denominated financial statements translate into fewer U.S. dollars. On average, foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2016; however, they did not weaken as significantly as they did in the first nine months of 2015. The fluctuations of foreign currencies during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 had an unfavorable
impact on net sales of $1.0 million and $11.7 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. On a reportable segment basis, the favorable (unfavorable) impact of foreign currency on net sales and net income for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, was as follows:      
   The operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are compared to the same period in 2015. Net sales
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $88.3 million decreased $.7 million, or 0.8%, compared to 2015. Excluding the unfavorable effect of currency translation, net sales were slightly higher at $89.3 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 32.7% in 2016 from 29.4% in 2015. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $28.9 million increased $2.7
million compared to 2015. Excluding the unfavorable effect of currency translation, gross profit increased $3.4 million, or 13%, compared to 2015. Costs and expenses of $22.2 million decreased $1.8 million compared to 2015. Excluding the favorable
effect of currency translation, costs and expenses decreased $1.5 million compared to 2015. Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $6.6 million, an increase of $4.5 million compared to 2015. Net income for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 of $4.7 million was an increase of $4.5 million compared to the net income in 2015. The effect of currency translation decreased operating income $.4 million and decreased net income $.2 million.  
 The operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are compared to the same period in 2015. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, net sales of $250.2 million decreased $12.5 million, or 4.8%, compared to 2015. The fluctuations of foreign currencies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 had an unfavorable impact on net sales of $11.7 million as compared to
2015. Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency translation, net sales decreased $.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 32.0% and 29.4% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross profit of $80.0 million increased $2.6 million as compared to 2015. Excluding the unfavorable effect of currency translation of $4.4 million, gross profit increased $7.0 million, or 9%,
compared to 2015. Costs and expenses of $65.6 million decreased $4.6 million compared to 2015. Excluding the favorable  
      20

effect of currency translation, costs and expenses decreased $1.8 million compared to 2015. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $14.4 million increased $7.2
million compared to 2015. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $10.2 million increased $6.5 million compared to 2015. The unfavorable effect of currency translation decreased operating income $1.6 million and net income
$1.2 million.    The following table reflects the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on operating income for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015:      
   Despite the uncertainty in the current global economy, we believe our business fundamentals and our financial position are
sound and that we are strategically well-positioned. We remain focused on assessing our business structure, global facilities and overall capacity in conjunction with the requirements of local manufacturing in the markets that we serve. If
necessary, we will modify redundant processes and utilize our global manufacturing network to manage costs, while driving increased sales volumes and delivering value to our customers. We have continued to invest in the business to improve
efficiency, develop new products, increase our capacity and become an even stronger supplier to our customers. We currently have a bank debt to equity ratio of 20.4% and can borrow needed funds at an attractive interest rate under our credit
facility.    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    THREE MONTHS ENDED
SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015    The following table sets forth a summary of the Company s Statement of
Consolidated Income and the percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company s past operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.  
   
    Net sales.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net sales were $88.3 million, a decrease of $.7 million,
or 1%, from the three months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the effect of currency translation, net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $.3 million compared to the same period in 2015 as summarized in the
following table:  
      21  

Table of Contents  

The decrease in PLP-USA net sales of $1.6 million, or 4%, was primarily due to a volume decrease in transmission and solar
sales. International net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were unfavorably affected by $1.0 million when local currencies were converted to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of net sales excludes the effect of currency
translation. The Americas net sales of $16.8 million increased $2.3 million, or 16%, primarily due to a volume increase in transmission sales. EMEA net sales of $15.2 million increased $3.8 million, or 31%, primarily due to a volume increase in
telecommunications sales and transmission projects in the region. In Asia-Pacific, net sales of $21.0 million decreased $4.3 million, or 17%, compared to 2015. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to a sales volume decline in solar and
transmission products.     Gross profit.  Gross profit of $28.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $2.7 million, or
10%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the effect of currency translation, gross profit increased $3.4 million, or 13%, as summarized in the following table:  
   
   PLP-USA gross profit of $13.3 million increased $.8 million compared to the same period in 2015. PLP-USA s increase in
gross profit was primarily due to a shift in sales mix toward products with higher margins for 2016 as compared to 2015. International gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was unfavorably impacted by $.7 million when local
currencies were translated to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of gross profit excludes the effects of currency translation. The Americas gross profit increase of $1.1 million was primarily the result of the sales increase of $2.3 combined
with product margin decline in the region due to sales mix. The EMEA gross profit increased $.7 million as a result of a $3.8 million sales increase, partially offset by product margin decline in the region due to a shift in sales mix. While
Asia-Pacific experienced a $4.3 million reduction in sales, gross profit increased $.9 million due to a shift in product sales mix along with continued cost savings associated with the 2015 reconfiguration of the operations of one of its locations
within the segment.     Costs and expenses.  Costs and expenses of $22.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $1.8
million, or 8%, compared to 2015. Excluding the favorable effect of currency translation, costs and expenses decreased $1.5 million, or 6%, as summarized in the following table:  
      22  

Table of Contents  

PLP-USA costs and expenses of $10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $.7 million, or 6%,
compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased foreign currency exchange gains of $3.1 million, partially offset by increased general and administrative expense of $2.4 million. The foreign currency exchange gains were primarily related to
translating into U.S. dollars its foreign denominated loans, trade and royalty receivables from its foreign subsidiaries at the September 30, 2016 exchange rates. Costs and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were
favorably impacted by $.4 million when local currencies were translated to U.S. dollars. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, costs and expenses decreased $1.5 million. The following discussion of costs and expenses excludes the
effect of currency translation. The Americas costs and expenses of $3.6 million remained constant for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. EMEA costs and expenses of $3.1 million increased $.4 million mainly due to increased
personnel related costs. Asia-Pacific costs and expenses of $4.7 million decreased $1.2 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower personnel related expenses due to cost savings associated with the 2015 reconfiguration of the operations of
one of its locations within the segment.     Other income (expense).  Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $.1
million compared to 2015, mainly as a result of higher interest expense.     Income taxes . Income taxes for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 were $1.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively, based on pre-tax income of $6.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 27% and 90%, respectively,
compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, which differ from the U.S., federal statutory income tax rate, and the relative amount of income earned in
those jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from year to year. In addition to the impact of state and local income taxes, the following items had the most significant impact on
the difference between our statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% and our effective tax rate:    2016  

1. 
 $.2 million, or 3%, decrease, primarily related to the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of statutes of limitations.    

2. 
 $.3 million, or 5%, decrease, resulting from U.S. permanent items, primarily related to the repatriation of foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested.    
 2015      

1. 
 $1.3 million, or 62%, increase, resulting from losses in certain jurisdictions where no tax benefit is recognized.        

2. 
 $.2 million, or 9%, decrease, resulting from earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate where such earnings are permanently reinvested.    

3. 
 $.1 million, or 2%, increase, resulting from U.S. permanent items, primarily related to the repatriation of foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested.    
  Net income.  As a result of the preceding items, net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.7 million, compared to net income
of $.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the effect of currency translation, net income increased $4.8 million as summarized in the following table:  
      23  

Table of Contents  

NM - Not Meaningful    PLP-USA
net income increased $1.6 million compared to 2015 due to a $1.4 million increase in operating income combined with a decrease in income taxes of $.4 million, partially offset by an increase in other expense of $.2 million. International net income
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 incurred an unfavorable change of $.2 million when local currencies were converted to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of net income excludes the effect of currency translation. The Americas
net income increased $.7 million as a result of a $1.1 million increase in operating income partially offset by an increase in income taxes of $.4 million. EMEA net income increased $.4 million as a result of an increase in operating income of $.3
combined with a decrease in income taxes of $.1 million. Asia-Pacific net loss decreased $2.1 million as a result of a $2.2 million increase in operating income partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $.1 million.  
 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  
 The following table sets forth a summary of the Company s Statements of Consolidated Income and the percentage of net sales for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company s past operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.      
    Net sales . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net sales were $250.2 million, a decrease of $12.5
million, or 5%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the unfavorable effect of currency translation, net sales decreased $.8 million as summarized in the following table:  
      24  

Table of Contents  

PLP-USA net sales of $104.1 million decreased $5.2 million, or 5%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in solar
sales. International net sales of $146.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were unfavorably affected by $11.7 million when local currencies were converted to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of changes in net sales
excludes the unfavorable effect of currency translation. The Americas net sales of $43.8 million increased $6.2 million, or 14%, primarily due to higher volume in transmission and telecommunications sales. EMEA net sales of $43.8 million increased
$8.0 million, or 20%, primarily due to increased volume in transmission and distribution sales, partially offset by decreased volume in telecommunications sales. Asia-Pacific net sales of $58.5 million decreased $9.7 million, or 14%, compared to the
same period in 2015. The decrease in net sales was related to volume decreases in solar and transmission sales.     Gross profit . Gross profit of
$80.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $2.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the effect of currency translation, gross profit increased $7.0 million, or 9%, as summarized
in the following table:      
   PLP-USA gross profit of $35.0 million decreased $2.3 million compared to the same period in 2015. PLP-USA s decrease in
gross profit was related to the decrease in sales volume, a shift in sales mix and increased freight costs resulting from the sales mix impact. International gross profit of $45.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
unfavorably impacted by $4.4 million when local currencies were translated to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of gross profit changes excludes the effects of currency translation. The Americas gross profit increase of $4.6 million was
primarily the result of a $6.2 million increase in net sales, improved product margins in the region and positive results from cost savings initiatives. The EMEA gross profit increased $3.6 million as a result of increased net sales of $8.0 million
in the region combined with a favorable product sales mix. Although sales decreased $9.7 million, Asia-Pacific gross profit increased $1.1 million as the overall sales were in higher margin products, along with continued cost savings associated with
the prior year reconfiguration of its operations and personnel reductions.     Costs and expenses . Costs and expenses of $65.6 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $4.6 million, or 7%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the favorable effect of currency translation, costs and expenses decreased 3% as summarized in the following
table:  
      25  

Table of Contents  

PLP-USA costs and expenses decreased $1.4 million primarily due to a $5.9 million improvement in net foreign currency exchange
effect offset by higher general and administrative expense of $4.6 million, including the $1.0 million charge related to the expiring lease of the Company aircraft incurred in the second quarter of 2016 combined with various decreases of $.1
million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was a gain recognized on foreign currency transactions while there was a loss for the same period in 2015. The foreign currency exchange gains were primarily related to translating
into U.S. dollars its foreign denominated loans, trade receivables and royalty receivables from the Company s foreign subsidiaries at the September 30, 2016 exchange rates. International costs and expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were unfavorably impacted by $2.8 million when local currencies were translated to U.S. dollars. The following discussions of costs and expenses exclude the effect of currency translation. The Americas costs and expenses
decrease of $.1 million was primarily due to improvement in foreign currency exchange of $.7 million, mostly offset by increased personnel related costs. EMEA costs and expenses increased $1.0 million as a result of higher personnel related expenses
predominantly from continued infrastructure expansion. Asia-Pacific costs and expenses decreased $1.3 million primarily due to $1.1 million of net foreign currency exchange gains across the region in the nine months ended September 30, 2016
versus the same period in 2015, combined with reduced personnel related costs.     Other income (expense).  Other expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 of $.4 million decreased $.2 million compared to 2015 primarily due to the 2015 reversal of a receivable recorded at the opening balance sheet date of a previous acquisition. The receivable represented the indemnification by
the prior owner for unrecognized tax benefits. The resolution of a foreign income tax audit resulted in a tax liability for less than the previously recorded accrual. The difference was recorded as a tax benefit in income tax expense and the
corresponding receivable, after receipt of the indemnified tax related amount, was recognized as other expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
  Income taxes.  Income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $3.8 million and $2.9 million, respectively, based on
pre-tax income of $14.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 27% and 45%, respectively, compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. Our tax rate is
affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, which differ from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate, and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may
occur in any given period but are not consistent from year to year. In addition to the impact of state and local income taxes, the following items had the most significant impact on the difference between our statutory U.S. federal income tax rate
of 35% and our effective tax rate:    2016      

1. 
 $.4 million, or 3%, increase, resulting from losses in certain jurisdictions where no tax benefit is recognized.        

2. 
 $.7 million, or 5%, decrease, resulting from earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate where such earnings are permanently reinvested.    

3. 
 $.4 million, or 3%, decrease, resulting from the release of valuation allowance in our Asia Pacific segment.        

4. 
 $.4 million, or 3%, decrease, primarily related to the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of statutes of limitations, coupled with various U.S. permanent items and discrete items.

  2015      

1. 
 $1.8 million, or 28%, increase, resulting from losses in certain jurisdictions where no tax benefit is recognized.        

2. 
 $.6 million, or 9%, decrease, resulting from earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate where such earnings are permanently reinvested.    

3. 
 $.8 million, or 12%, decrease, resulting from a favorable resolution of a foreign audit in our Asia Pacific segment for which a larger tax liability had previously been accrued.    

4. 
 $.2 million, or 3%, increase, resulting from U.S. permanent items, primarily related to the repatriation of foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested.    
  Net income.  As a result of the preceding items, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $10.2 million, compared to $3.6
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the unfavorable effect of currency translation, net income increased $7.7 million as summarized in the following table:  
   
   NM - Not Meaningful    PLP-USA
net income decreased $.1 million due to a $.9 million decrease in operating income combined with higher other expense of $.5 million and lower income taxes of $1.3 million. International net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
increased $6.6 million on a consolidated basis when local currencies were converted to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of net income excludes the effect of currency translation. The Americas net income increased $3.1 million as a result of a
$4.8 million increase in operating income partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in income tax expense. EMEA net income increased $2.1 million primarily due to a $2.6 million increase in operating income offset by increased income tax expense
of $.5 million. Asia-Pacific net loss decreased $2.6 million. The operating loss decreased $3.1 million, offset by a lower net tax benefit in the region of $.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period
in 2015.    APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  
 Our critical accounting policies are consistent with the information set forth in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations, included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on March 11, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are, therefore, not presented herein.  
 WORKING CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Management
Assessment of Liquidity     We measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short-term and long-term operating needs, repay debt, fund additional
investments, including acquisitions, and make dividend payments to shareholders. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, cash dividends, business acquisitions and
access to bank lines of credit.  
      27  

Table of Contents  

  Our investments include expenditures required for equipment and facilities as well as expenditures in support of
our strategic initiatives. In 2016, we used cash of $21.7 million for capital expenditures. We ended the first nine months of 2016 with $32.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations
throughout the world. At September 30, 2016, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S. We expect accumulated non-U.S. cash balances will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs
through future cash flows, use of U.S. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources. We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing financial statements for
customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity from
customer credit issues.    Our financial position remains strong and our current ratio was 3.1 to 1 at September 30, 2016. Total debt at
September 30, 2016 was $46.1 million. At September 30, 2016, our unused availability under our line of credit was $30.2 million and our bank debt to equity percentage was 20.4%. On August 22, 2016, we increased our borrowing capacity
under our credit facility from $50 million to $65 million and extended the term to June 30, 2019. All other terms remain the same, including the interest rate at LIBOR plus 1.125% unless our funded debt to Earnings before Interest, Taxes and
Depreciation ratio exceeds 2.25 to 1, then the LIBOR spread becomes 1.500%. The line of credit agreement contains, among other provisions, requirements for maintaining levels of net worth and funded debt-to-earnings before interest taxes
depreciation amortization along with an interest coverage ratio. At June 27, 2016, we entered into a promissory note with PNC Bank, NA, pursuant to which we borrowed $14.5 million at a fixed rate of 2.71%, due July 1, 2026, which was used
to purchase a corporate aircraft to replace the expiring lease of the previous aircraft. The loan is secured by the aircraft. The net worth and profitability requirements are calculated based on the line of credit agreement. At September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with these covenants.    We expect that our major source of funding for 2016 and beyond will be our
operating cash flows, our existing cash and cash equivalents as well as our line of credit agreement. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the United States, which, except for current earnings in certain jurisdictions, is
deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We believe our future operating cash flows will be more than sufficient to cover debt repayments, other
contractual obligations, capital expenditures and dividends for the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we believe our borrowing capacity provides substantial financial resources, if needed, to supplement funding
of capital expenditures and/or acquisitions. We also believe that we can expand our borrowing capacity, if necessary; however, we do not believe we would increase our debt to a level that would have a material adverse impact upon results of
operations or financial condition.     Sources and Uses of Cash   
 Cash increased $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities was $21.0 million. The major investing
and financing uses of cash were capital expenditures of $21.7 million, net repurchase of common shares of $4.4 million and dividends of $3.1 million. Currency had a negative $2.1 million impact on cash and cash equivalents when translating foreign
denominated financial statements to U.S. dollars.    Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased
$13.2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in net income of $6.5 million, an increase in non-cash transactions of $2.4 million and a decrease in operating assets (net
of operating liabilities) of $4.2 million.    Net cash used by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $23.0 million
represents an increase of $14.7 million when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily related to higher capital expenditures of $15.0 million primarily related to the purchase of a corporate aircraft to
replace the expiring lease of the previous aircraft.    Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6.5
million compared to $6.9 million of cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $13.4 million increase was primarily a result of an increase in net debt borrowings in 2016 compared to 2015 of $13.9
million.  
      28

This increase in cash provided was partially offset with a net increase in cash used in stock repurchases of $.8 million.  
 RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    In November 2015,
the FASB issued Accounting Standards update (ASU) No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified
balance sheet. Prior to the issuance of the standard, deferred tax liabilities and assets were required to be separately classified into a current amount and a noncurrent amount in the balance sheet. The new accounting guidance represents a change
in accounting principle and the standard is required to be adopted in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and we elected to early adopt this guidance as of March 31, 2016 and to apply the guidance
retrospectively to all periods presented. Accordingly, we reclassified the prior period amount of $8.6 million related to our deferred tax assets and $.2 million related to our deferred tax liabilities from current to noncurrent. The
reclassification resulted in an increase of $7.4 million to our noncurrent deferred tax assets and a decrease of $1.0 million to our noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities. Because the application of this guidance affects classification only,
such reclassifications did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of our operations.    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE
ADOPTED    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting. ASU 2016-09 provides guidance in GAAP for the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash
flows. The Company is required to adopt ASU 2016   09 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. If an
entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same
period. We are currently evaluating what impact, if any, its adoption will have to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.    In February
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  The amendments in this Update require the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about
leasing arrangements. Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation. Both the asset and liability will initially be measured at the present
value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Subsequent measurement, including the presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a finance or an operating lease. Initial costs
directly attributable to negotiating and arranging the lease will be included in the asset. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee can make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize an asset and
corresponding liability. Lessees will also be required to provide additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures are intended to supplement the
amounts recorded in the financial statements and provide additional information about the nature of an organization s leasing activities. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating what impact, if any, its adoption will have to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.  
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  The amendments in this Update more
closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable
value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured
using LIFO or the retail inventory method. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this
Update should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are currently evaluating what impact, if any, its adoption will have to the presentation of our consolidated
financial statements.

  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), 
or ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue in a matter that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, the amendment provides five steps that an entity should apply when recognizing revenue. The amendment also specifies the accounting of some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a
customer and expands the disclosure requirements around contracts with customers. An entity can either adopt this amendment retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with cumulative effect of initially applying the
update recognized at the date of initial application. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 deferring the effective date of the amendment to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating
what impact, if any, its adoption will have to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.    FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  
 Cautionary Statement for  Safe Harbor  Purposes Under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  
 This Form 10-Q and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) contain forward-looking statements regarding the
Company s and management s beliefs and expectations. As a general matter, forward-looking statements are those focused upon future plans, objectives or performance (as opposed to historical items) and include statements of anticipated
events or trends and expectations and beliefs relating to matters not historical in nature. Such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to the Company s operations and business environment, all of which are
difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company s control. Such uncertainties and factors could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by such forward-looking
statements.    The following factors, among others, could affect the Company s future performance and cause the Company s actual results to differ
materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements made in this report:      

The overall demand for cable anchoring and control hardware for electrical transmission and distribution lines on a worldwide basis, which has a slow growth rate in mature markets such as the United States (U.S.),
Canada, Australia and Western Europe and may grow slowly or experience prolonged delay in developing regions despite expanding power needs;        

The potential impact of the global economic condition on the Company s ongoing profitability and future growth opportunities in our core markets in the U.S. and other foreign countries where the financial situation
is expected to be similar going forward;        

Decrease in infrastructure spending globally as a result of worldwide depressed spending;        

The impact of low oil and other commodity prices on our growth opportunities, particularly with respect to energy projects;        

The ability of our customers to raise funds needed to build the facilities their customers require;        

Technological developments that affect longer-term trends for communication lines, such as wireless communication;        

The decreasing demand for product supporting copper-based infrastructure due to the introduction of products using new technologies or adoption of new industry standards;    

The Company s success at continuing to develop proprietary technology and maintaining high quality products and customer service to meet or exceed new industry performance standards and individual customer
expectations;    
      30

The Company s success in strengthening and retaining relationships with the Company s customers, growing sales at targeted accounts and expanding geographically;    

The extent to which the Company is successful at expanding the Company s product line or production facilities into new areas or implementing efficiency measures at existing facilities;    

The effects of fluctuation in currency exchange rates upon the Company s foreign subsidiaries  operations and reported results from international operations, together with non-currency risks of investing in
and conducting significant operations in foreign countries, including those relating to political, social, economic and regulatory factors;

    ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
 The Company operates manufacturing facilities and offices around the world and uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance the Company s global
operations. As a result, the Company is subject to business risks inherent in non-U.S. activities, including political and economic uncertainty, import and export limitations and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency
exchange rates. The Company believes that the political and economic risks related to the Company s international operations are mitigated due to the geographic diversity in which the Company s international operations are located.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading
purposes.    The Company s primary currency rate exposures are related to foreign denominated debt, intercompany debt, forward exchange contracts,
foreign denominated receivables and payables and cash and short-term investments. A hypothetical 10% change in currency rates would have a favorable/unfavorable impact on fair values on such instruments of $5.6 million and on income before taxes of
$2.3 million.    The Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable
rate revolving credit facilities and term notes, which consisted of borrowings of $32.0 million at September 30, 2016. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $.3
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

 There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  
    PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   
    ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   
 The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any
ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

and request additional advances hereunder until the Expiration Date, subject to the terms and conditions of this Note and the Loan Documents (as hereinafter defined). The   Expiration Date   shall mean June 30, 2019, or such

shall not exceed the face amount of this Note.  
      1  

(b) The Borrower Representative may request that advances under this Note and subject LCs under the Loan
Documents be made or issued in an Agreed Foreign Currency;  provided , that in no event shall the sum of (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of advances under this Note made in Agreed Foreign Currencies  plus  (ii) the
sum of the aggregate undrawn balance of all then outstanding subject LCs under the Loan Documents issued in Agreed Foreign Currencies and the aggregate amount of all unreimbursed draws of all then outstanding subject LCs under the Loan Documents
issued in Agreed Foreign Currencies (the   Foreign LC Exposure  ) exceed $15,000,000 at any one time outstanding (the   Agreed Foreign Currency Limit  ). In no event shall advances made under this Note in Agreed Foreign
Currencies in Australian Dollars to PLP Australia (the   Australian Loan  ) exceed $2,000,000 Australian Dollars at any one time outstanding (the   Australian Loan Limit  ). Further, in no event shall the Foreign LC
Exposure exceed $5,000,000 at any one time outstanding. As used herein, the term   Agreed Foreign Currencies   shall mean Mexican Pesos, Australian Dollars and any other foreign currency requested by the Borrower Representative and
approved by the Bank in its sole discretion, and   Agreed Foreign Currency   shall mean any one of such currencies. Other than Australian Loans, each advance under this Note made in an Agreed Foreign Currency shall bear interest at

 (c) All advances under this Note and subject LCs under the Loan Documents made or issued in Agreed Foreign Currencies shall be governed by the Bank s
standard fees, charges, agreements, policy guidelines and other terms and provisions relating to such advances and issuances as in effect from time to time (collectively, the   Bank s Standard Foreign Currency Terms  ), in
addition to the specific provisions set forth herein. In the event of any conflict between the Bank s Standard Foreign Currency Terms and the terms of this Note or any other Loan Document, the Bank s Standard Foreign Currency Terms shall
govern.    (d) The Bank will determine the Dollar Amount of all outstanding advances under this Note made in Agreed Foreign Currencies and the Foreign LC
Exposure (such outstanding advances and the Foreign LC Exposure at any time being the   Foreign Currency Outstandings  ) from time to time on and as of any Business Day elected by the Bank in its sole discretion (each such day upon or
as of which the Bank so determines Dollar Amounts being a   Computation Date  ). If at any time the Dollar Amount of Foreign Currency Outstandings (calculated as of the most recent Computation Date) exceeds the Agreed Foreign Currency
Limit, then the Borrowers shall immediately prepay such Foreign Currency Outstandings in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to eliminate any such excess. If at any time the aggregate amount of all Australian Loan advances outstanding under
this Note exceeds the Australian Loan Limit, then the Borrowers shall immediately prepay in Australian Dollars an aggregate principal amount to eliminate such excess (as such amount is determined by the Bank). As used herein, the term
  Dollar Amount   shall mean, with respect to any currency at any date, (i) the amount of such currency if such currency is in Dollars or (ii) the equivalent in such currency of such amount of Dollars if such currency is
currency other than Dollars, calculated on the basis of the arithmetical mean of the buy sell spot rates of exchange of the Bank for such currency on the London market at 11:00 a.m. London time, on or as of the most recent Computation Date.
  Dollars   and   $   mean the lawful currency of the United States of America.    All payments due hereunder shall be made
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imports, deductions, charges or withholdings imposed by any jurisdiction or taxing authority, domestic or foreign, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding (i) taxes imposed on the Bank s net income and (ii) taxes imposed on the Bank s net income and franchise taxes imposed on the Bank, by the jurisdiction of the Bank s lending office or any political subdivision
thereof (all such non- 
      2  

excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as   Taxes  ). If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or
withhold any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this paragraph) the Bank will receive an amount equal to the sum the Bank would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made, and (ii) each Borrower agrees to pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the
relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law and promptly provide to the Bank the official receipt or other document evidencing such payment. In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or
document taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Note (hereinafter referred to as
  Other Taxes  ). If any Taxes or Other Taxes required to be paid by any Borrower hereunder are not paid and are imposed on and paid by the Bank, the Borrowers shall indemnify the Bank and reimburse the Bank for the amount of such
payment, together with any interest, penalties and expenses in connection therewith, whether or not such tax shall have been correctly or legally imposed. Such reimbursement shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date the Bank makes
written demand therefor.    The specification herein that payment be made in the relevant Agreed Foreign Currency or Dollars, as the case may be, at 1900
East Ninth Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44114 or such other location as may be designated by the Bank from time to time, is of the essence hereof. If payment is not made in the currency due hereunder or under any other Loan Document (the
  Contractual Currency  ) or if any court or tribunal shall render a judgment or order for the payment of amounts due hereunder or under any other Loan Document and such judgment is expressed in a currency other than the Contractual
Currency, each Borrower shall indemnify and hold the Bank harmless against any deficiency in terms of the amount received by the Bank arising or resulting from any variation as between (i) the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency
is converted into the currency actually received or the currency in which the judgment is expressed (the   Received Currency  ) and (ii) the rate of exchange at which the Bank would, in accordance with normal banking procedures,
be able to purchase the Contractual Currency with the Received Currency by the Bank on the Business Day following receipt of the Received Currency. If the court or tribunal has fixed the date on which the rate of exchange is determined for the
conversion of the judgment currency into the Contractual Currency (the   Conversion Date  ) and if there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Conversion Date and the date of receipt by the Bank, then the
Borrowers will, notwithstanding such judgment or order, pay such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Received Currency when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of receipt will produce the
amount then due to the Bank from the Borrowers hereunder in the Contractual Currency.    If a Borrower shall wind up, liquidate, dissolve or become bankrupt
while there remains outstanding (i) any amounts owing to the Bank under this Note or under any other Loan Document, (ii) any damages owing to the Bank in respect of a breach of any of the terms hereof or (iii) any judgment or order
rendered in respect of such amounts or damages, each Borrower shall indemnify and hold the Bank harmless against any deficiency in terms of the Contractual Currency in the amounts received by the Bank arising or resulting from any variation as
between (a) the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency is converted into another currency (the   Liquidation Currency  ) for purposes of such winding-up, liquidation, dissolution or bankruptcy with regard to the
amount in the Contractual Currency due or contingently due hereunder or under any other Loan Document or under any judgment or order into which the relevant obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall have been merged and
(b) the rate of exchange at which the Bank could, in accordance with normal banking procedures be able to purchase the Contractual Currency with the Liquidation Currency at the earlier of (1) the date of payment of such amounts or damages
and (2) the final date or dates for the filing of proofs of a claim in a winding- 
      3  

up, liquidation, dissolution or bankruptcy. As used in the preceding sentence, the  final date  or  dates for the filing of proofs of a claim in a winding-up, liquidation,
dissolution or bankruptcy  shall be the date fixed by the liquidator or other appropriate person or otherwise applicable under the applicable law as being the last practicable date as of which the liabilities of a Borrower may be ascertained
for such winding-up, liquidation, dissolution or bankruptcy before payment by the liquidator or other appropriate person in respect thereof.     2.  Rate
of Interest .  Each advance outstanding under this Note will bear interest at a rate or rates per annum as may be selected by the Borrowers from the interest rate options set forth below (other than advances denominated in Australian Dollars

applies, the period of thirty (30) days, commencing on the date of disbursement of an advance (or the date of conversion of an advance to the Australian Bank Bill Swap Bid Rate, as the case may be) and each successive period of thirty
(30) days thereafter; provided that, if an Australian Dollar Loan Interest Period would end on a day which is not a Business Day, it shall end on the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the next succeeding calendar month in
which case the Australian Dollar Loan Interest Period shall end on the next preceding Business Day.      Base Rate   shall
mean the highest of (A) the Prime Rate, and (B) the sum of the Federal Funds Open Rate  plus  fifty (50) basis points (0.50%), and (C) the sum of the Daily LIBOR  plus  one hundred (100) basis points (1.0%), so
long as a Daily LIBOR is offered, ascertainable and not unlawful.

determined by the Bank at such time (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error); provided however, that if such day is not a Business Day, the Federal Funds Open Rate for such day shall be the  open  rate on the

      6

(i) the rate of interest determined by the Bank in accordance with its usual procedures (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) to be the eurodollar rate two (2) Business Days prior to the first day of such LIBOR
Interest Period for an amount comparable to such advance and having a borrowing date and a maturity comparable to such LIBOR Interest Period by (ii) a number equal to 1.00 minus the LIBOR Reserve Percentage,  provided ,  however , if

 LIBOR and the Daily LIBOR shall be adjusted with respect to any advance to which the LIBOR Option or Base Rate Option or the Daily LIBOR Option applies, as
applicable, on and as of the effective date of any change in the LIBOR Reserve Percentage. The Bank shall give prompt notice to the Borrowers of LIBOR or the Daily LIBOR as determined or adjusted in accordance herewith, which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.    If the Bank determines (which determination shall be final and conclusive) that, by reason of circumstances affecting
the eurodollar market generally, deposits in dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to banks in the eurodollar market for the selected term, or adequate means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR, then the Bank shall give notice
thereof to the Borrowers. Thereafter, until the Bank notifies the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (a) the availability of the LIBOR Option and Daily LIBOR Option shall be suspended, and
(b) the interest rate for all advances then bearing interest under the LIBOR Option or the Daily LIBOR Option, as applicable, shall be converted at the expiration of the then current LIBOR Interest Period(s) to the Base Rate Option.  
 In addition, if, after the date of this Note, the Bank shall determine (which determination shall be final and conclusive) that any enactment, promulgation or
adoption of or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by a governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by the Bank with any guideline, request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for the Bank to make or maintain or
fund loans based on LIBOR or in an Agreed Foreign Currency, the Bank shall notify the Borrowers. Upon receipt of such notice, until the Bank notifies the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer apply,
(a) the availability of the LIBOR Option and the Daily LIBOR Option and the option to request advances and subject LCs in such Agreed Foreign Currency shall be suspended, and (b) the interest rate on all advances then bearing interest
under the LIBOR Option and the Daily LIBOR Option shall be converted to the Base Rate Option either (i) on the last day of the then current LIBOR Interest Period(s) if the Bank may lawfully continue to maintain advances based on LIBOR to such
day, or (ii) immediately if the Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain advances based on LIBOR, and (c) Borrowers will prepay all outstanding advances hereunder made in such Agreed Foreign Currency, together with interest thereon, and
(d) all subject LCs issued in such Foreign Currencies shall be deemed terminated.    The foregoing notwithstanding, it is understood that the Borrowers
may select different Options to apply simultaneously to different portions of the advances and may select up to six (6) different interest periods to apply simultaneously to different portions of the advances bearing interest under the LIBOR
Option. Interest hereunder will be calculated based on the actual number of days that principal is outstanding over a year of 360 days. In no event will the rate of interest hereunder exceed the maximum rate allowed by law.  
  3.  Interest Rate Election  . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Note, at the end of each interest period applicable to any advance, the
Borrower Representative may renew the Option applicable to such advance or convert such advance to a different Option;  provided   that , during any period in which any Event of Default (as hereinafter defined) has occurred and is
continuing, any advances bearing interest under the LIBOR Option or the Daily LIBOR Option shall, at the Bank s sole discretion, be converted at the end of the applicable LIBOR Interest Period (or immediately in the case of the Daily LIBOR
Option) to the Base Rate Option and the LIBOR Option and the Daily LIBOR Option will not be  
      8  

available to the Borrowers with respect to any new advances (or with respect to the conversion or renewal of any existing advances) until such Event of Default has been cured by the Borrowers or
waived by the Bank. The Borrower Representative shall notify the Bank of each election of an Option, each conversion from one Option to another, the amount of the advances then outstanding to be allocated to each Option and where relevant the
interest periods therefor. In the case of converting to the LIBOR Option or the Daily LIBOR Option, such notice shall be given at least three (3) Business Days prior to the commencement of any LIBOR Interest Period or when the Borrower
Representative would like to commence the Daily LIBOR Option, as the case may be. If no interest period is specified in any such notice for which the resulting advance is to bear interest under the LIBOR Option, the Borrower Representative shall be
deemed to have selected a LIBOR Interest Period of one month s duration. If no notice of election, conversion or renewal is timely received by the Bank with respect to any advance, the Borrower Representative shall be deemed to have elected the
Base Rate Option. Any such election shall be promptly confirmed in writing by such method as the Bank may require.     4.  Advance Procedures .  A
request for advance made by telephone must be promptly confirmed in writing by such method as the Bank may require. Each Borrower authorizes the Bank to accept telephonic requests for advances, and the Bank shall be entitled to rely upon the
authority of the CFO, VP   Finance, Controller, General Counsel, or Treasury Manager providing such instructions. Each Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds the Bank harmless from and against any and all damages, losses, liabilities, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses) which may arise or be created by the acceptance of such telephone requests or making such advances. The Bank will enter on its books and records, which entry when made will be
presumed correct, the date and amount of each advance, the interest rate and interest period applicable thereto, as well as the date and amount of each payment.  
  5.  Payment Terms; Commitment Fee  . The Borrowers shall pay accrued interest on the unpaid principal balance of this Note in arrears: (a) for
the portion of advances bearing interest under the Base Rate Option and the Daily LIBOR Option, on the first day of each month during the term hereof, (b) for the portion of advances bearing interest under the LIBOR Option, on the last day of
the respective LIBOR Interest Period for such advance, (c) if any LIBOR Interest Period is longer than three (3) months, then also on the three (3) month anniversary of such interest period and every three (3) months thereafter,
and (d) for all advances, at maturity, whether by acceleration of this Note or otherwise, and after maturity, on demand until paid in full. All outstanding principal and accrued interest hereunder shall be due and payable in full on the
Expiration Date. All advances under this Note shall be repaid and each payment of interest thereon shall be paid in the currency in which such advance was made. If for any reason any Borrower is prohibited by any law, rule, regulation or any other
reason from making any required payment hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents in an Agreed Foreign Currency, such Borrower will make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Amount of such Agreed Foreign Currency payment amount.  
 If any payment under this Note shall become due on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday under the laws of the State where the Bank s office indicated
above is located, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment. Each Borrower hereby authorizes the Bank to charge such
Borrower s deposit account at the Bank for any payment when due hereunder. Payments received will be applied to charges, fees and expenses (including attorneys  fees), accrued interest and principal in any order the Bank may choose, in its
sole discretion.    The Borrowers shall pay to the Bank quarterly in arrears, on the last day of each calendar quarter, a commitment fee in the amount of
the product of twenty (20) basis points (0.20%) per annum  multiplied by  the average daily unused amount of the Facility during the most recently ended quarter.  
      9  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, if, after the
making of any advance under this Note in any currency other than Dollars, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which such advance was made (the
  Original Currency  ) no longer exists or a Borrower is not able to make payment to the Bank in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by such Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in
Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrowers take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.
    6.  Late Payments; Default Rate .  If any Borrower fails to make any payment of principal, interest or other amount coming due pursuant to the
provisions of this Note within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date due and payable, such Borrower also shall pay to the Bank a late charge equal to the lesser of five percent (5%) of the amount of such payment or $100.00 (the
  Late Charge  ). Such fifteen (15) day period shall not be construed in any way to extend the due date of any such payment. Upon maturity, whether by acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at the Bank s option upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default (as hereinafter defined) and during the continuance thereof, each advance outstanding under this Note shall bear interest at a rate per annum (based on the actual number of days that principal is outstanding over a
year of 360 days) which shall be two percentage points (2%) in excess of the interest rate in effect from time to time under this Note but not more than the maximum rate allowed by law (the   Default Rate  ). The Default
Rate shall continue to apply whether or not judgment shall be entered on this Note. Both the Late Charge and the Default Rate are imposed as liquidated damages for the purpose of defraying the Bank s expenses incident to the handling of
delinquent payments, but are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Bank s exercise of any rights and remedies hereunder, under the other Loan Documents or under applicable law, and any fees and expenses of any agents or attorneys which the
Bank may employ. In addition, the Default Rate reflects the increased credit risk to the Bank of carrying a loan that is in default. Each Borrower agrees that the Late Charge and Default Rate are reasonable forecasts of just compensation for
anticipated and actual harm incurred by the Bank, and that the actual harm incurred by the Bank cannot be estimated with certainty and without difficulty.  
  7.  Prepayment; Reduction of Facility .  The Borrowers shall have the right to prepay any advance hereunder at any time and from time to time, in
whole or in part; subject, however, to payment of any break funding indemnification amounts owing pursuant to paragraph 8 below. The Borrowers shall have the right to reduce the Facility from time to time in a minimum of $1,000,000 increments.  
  8.  Yield Protection; Break Funding Indemnification  . The Borrowers shall pay to the Bank on written demand therefor, together with the written
evidence of the justification therefor, all direct costs incurred, losses suffered or payments made by Bank by reason of any change in law or regulation or its interpretation imposing any reserve, deposit, allocation of capital, or similar
requirement (including without limitation, Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) on the Bank, its holding company or any of their respective assets. In addition, each Borrower agrees to indemnify the Bank against any
liabilities, losses or expenses (including, without limitation, loss of margin, any loss or expense sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, and any loss or expense incurred in connection with funds acquired to
effect, fund or maintain any advance (or any part thereof) bearing interest under the LIBOR Option) which the Bank sustains or incurs as a consequence of either (i) any Borrower s failure to make a payment on the due date thereof,
(ii) any Borrower s revocation (expressly, by later inconsistent notices or otherwise) in whole or in part of any notice given to Bank to request, convert, renew or prepay any advance bearing interest under the LIBOR Option, or
(iii) any Borrower s payment or prepayment (whether voluntary, after acceleration of the maturity of this Note or otherwise) or conversion of any advance bearing interest under the LIBOR Option on a day other than the last day of the
applicable LIBOR Interest Period. A notice as to any amounts payable pursuant to this  
      10  

paragraph given to any Borrower by the Bank shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and shall be payable upon demand. Each Borrower s indemnification obligations hereunder
shall survive the payment in full of the advances and all other amounts payable hereunder.     9.  Other Loan Documents .  This Note is issued in
connection with the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement between the Borrowers and the Bank, dated as of September 24, 2015 (as further amended, modified or renewed from time to time, the   Loan Agreement  ), and the other
agreements and documents now or hereafter executed and/or delivered in connection herewith or therewith or referred to herein or therein (including, without limitation, the subject LCs), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference (this
Note, the Loan Agreement, and such other agreements and documents, each as amended, modified or renewed from time to time, being collectively referred to as the   Loan Documents  ), and is secured by the property (if any) described in
the Loan Documents and by such other collateral as previously may have been or may in the future be granted to the Bank to secure this Note. Capitalized and other terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the other Loan
Documents.        10.  Events of Default .  The occurrence of any of the following events will be deemed to be an   Event of
Default   under this Note: (i) (A) the nonpayment of (1) any principal under this Note when due and (2) interest, other indebtedness or any other amounts payable under this Note or any of the other Loan Documents (other
than reimbursements referred to in clause (i)(B) of this Section 10) within ten (10) days after the same is due, and (B) failure to reimburse the Bank for any draft or other item paid by Bank pursuant to or otherwise in respect of any

receivership, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, conservatorship or similar proceeding (and, in the case of any such proceeding instituted against any Obligor, such proceeding is not dismissed or stayed within 30 days of the commencement
thereof, provided that the Bank shall not be obligated to advance additional funds hereunder during such period); (iv) any assignment by any Obligor for the benefit of creditors, or any levy, garnishment, attachment or similar proceeding is
instituted against any property of any Obligor held by or deposited with the Bank or the cessation of all or a substantial part of the business operations of any Obligor; (v) a default with respect to any other indebtedness of any Obligor for
borrowed money, if the effect of such default is to cause or permit the acceleration of such debt, provided that this subsection shall not apply if and only so long as the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all such indebtedness in default does
not exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000) at any one time outstanding; in this subsection,  default  means that (A) there shall have occurred (or shall exist) in respect of the indebtedness in question any event, condition or other
thing that constitutes, or that with the giving of notice or the lapse of any applicable grace period or both would constitute, a default which accelerates (or permits any creditor or creditors or representative or creditors to accelerate) the
maturity of any such indebtedness, (B) any such indebtedness (other than any payable on demand) shall not have been paid in full at its stated maturity, or (C) any such indebtedness payable on demand shall not have been paid in full within
ten (10) banking days after any actual demand for payment); (vi) if at any time (A) the aggregate of all undischarged final judgments (excluding final judgments the execution of which, on the date of determination, are effectively
stayed) against the Obligors or any thereof for the payment of money shall exceed $5,000,000 or (B) the aggregate of all liabilities of the Obligors arising from defaults under ERISA (as defined in the Loan Agreement), shall exceed $5,000,000;

Document or any other documents now or in the future evidencing or securing the obligations of any Obligor to the Bank, is false, erroneous or misleading in any material respect; (xi) if
this Note or any guarantee executed by any Obligor is secured, the failure of any Obligor to provide the Bank with additional collateral if in the Bank s opinion at any time or times, the market value of any of the collateral securing this Note
or any guarantee has depreciated below that required pursuant to the Loan Documents or, if no specific value is so required, then in an amount deemed material by the Bank; (xii) the revocation or attempted revocation, in whole or in part, of
any guarantee by any Obligor; or (xiii) the occurrence of a Change of Control. As used herein, the term   Obligor   means any Borrower, and any guarantor of the Borrowers  obligations to the Bank existing on the date of this
Note or arising in the future.    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default: (a) the Bank shall be under no further
obligation to make advances hereunder; (b) if an Event of Default specified in clause (iii) or (iv) above shall occur, the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest hereunder together with any additional amounts payable
hereunder shall be immediately due and payable without demand or notice of any kind; (c) if any other Event of Default shall occur, the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest hereunder together with any additional amounts payable
hereunder, at the Bank s option and without demand or notice of any kind, may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable; (d) at the Bank s option, this Note will bear interest at the Default Rate from the date of the
occurrence of the Event of Default; and (e) the Bank may exercise from time to time any of the rights and remedies available under the Loan Documents or under applicable law.  
  11.  Power to Confess Judgment . Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes any
  attorney-at-law,   including an attorney employed by or retained and paid by the Bank, to appear in any court of record in or of the State of Ohio, or in any other state
or territory of the United States, at any time after the indebtedness evidenced by this Note becomes due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, to waive the issuing and service of process and to confess a judgment against any Borrower in favor of
the Bank, and/or any assignee or holder hereof for the amount of principal and interest and expenses then appearing due from the Borrowers under this Note, together with costs of suit and thereupon to release all errors and waive all right of appeal
or stays of execution in any court of record. Each Borrower hereby expressly (i) waives any conflict of interest of the attorney(s) retained by the Bank to confess judgment against any Borrower upon this Note, and (ii) consents to the
receipt by such attorney(s) of a reasonable legal fee from the Bank for legal services rendered for confessing judgment against any Borrower upon this Note. A copy of this Note, certified by the Bank, may be filed in each such proceeding in place of
filing the original as a warrant of attorney.      12.  Right of Setoff .  In addition to all liens upon and rights of setoff against any
Borrower s money, securities or other property given to the Bank by law, the Bank shall have, with respect to the Borrowers  obligations to the Bank under this Note and to the extent permitted by law, a contractual possessory security
interest in and a contractual right of setoff against, and each Borrower hereby grants the Bank a security interest in, and hereby assigns, conveys, delivers, pledges and transfers to the Bank, all of such Borrower s right, title and interest
in and to, all of such Borrower s deposits, moneys, securities and other property now or hereafter in the possession of or on deposit with, or in transit to, the Bank or any other direct or indirect subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services
Group, Inc., whether held in a general or special account or deposit, whether held jointly with someone else, or whether held for safekeeping or otherwise, excluding, however, all IRA, Keogh, and trust accounts. Every such security interest and
right of setoff may be exercised without demand upon or notice to the Borrowers. Every such right of setoff shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder without any action of the Bank,
although the Bank may enter such setoff on its books and records at a later time.  
      12  

13.  Indemnity .  Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each of the Bank, each legal entity, if any, who
controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Bank, and each of their respective directors, officers and employees (the   Indemnified Parties  ), and to defend and hold each Indemnified Party harmless from and against
any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including all fees and charges of internal or external counsel with whom any Indemnified Party may consult and all expenses of litigation and preparation therefor) which any Indemnified
Party may incur or which may be asserted against any Indemnified Party by any person, entity or governmental authority (including any person or entity claiming derivatively on behalf of any Borrower), in connection with or arising out of or relating
to the matters referred to in this Note or in the other Loan Documents or the use of any advance hereunder, whether (a) arising from or incurred in connection with any breach of a representation, warranty or covenant by any Borrower, or
(b) arising out of or resulting from any suit, action, claim, proceeding or governmental investigation, pending or threatened, whether based on statute, regulation or order, or tort, or contract or otherwise, before any court or governmental
authority;  provided ,  however , that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses solely attributable to an Indemnified Party s gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The indemnity agreement contained in this Section shall survive the termination of this Note, payment of any advance hereunder and the assignment of any rights hereunder. Any Borrower may participate at its expense in the defense of any such action
or claim.     14.  Miscellaneous.   All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals and other communications required or permitted hereunder
(  Notices  ) must be in writing (except as may be agreed otherwise above with respect to borrowing requests) and will be effective upon receipt. Notices may be given in any manner to which the parties may separately agree. Without
limiting the foregoing, first-class mail, facsimile transmission, electronic mail and commercial courier service are hereby agreed to as acceptable methods for giving Notices. Regardless of the manner in which provided, Notices may be sent to a
party s address as set forth above or to such other address as any party may give to the other for such purpose in accordance with this paragraph. No delay or omission on the Bank s part to exercise any right or power arising hereunder
will impair any such right or power or be considered a waiver of any such right or power, nor will the Bank s action or inaction impair any such right or power. The Bank s rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive of
any other rights or remedies which the Bank may have under other agreements, at law or in equity. No modification, amendment or waiver of, or consent to any departure by the Borrowers from, any provision of this Note will be effective unless made in
a writing signed by the Bank, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. The Borrowers agree to pay on demand, to the extent permitted by law, all costs and expenses incurred
by the Bank in the enforcement of its rights in this Note and in any security therefor, including without limitation reasonable fees and expenses of the Bank s counsel. If any provision of this Note is found to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court, all the other provisions of this Note will remain in full force and effect. Each Borrower and all other makers and indorsers of this Note hereby forever waive presentment, protest, notice of dishonor and
notice of non-payment. Each Borrower also waives all defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral. If this Note is executed by more than one Borrower, the obligations of such persons or entities hereunder will be joint and several. This
Note shall bind each Borrower and its heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and the benefits hereof shall inure to the benefit of the Bank and its successors and assigns;  provided ,  however , that no Borrower may
assign this Note in whole or in part without the Bank s written consent and the Bank at any time may assign this Note in whole or in part.    If for
the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the  specified currency ) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to
the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Bank could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Bank s main
office on the Business Day  
      13  

preceding that on which final,  non-appealable  judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due to the Lender hereunder shall,
notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by Bank of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency Bank may in accordance with
normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to Bank in the specified currency, the Borrowers agree, to the
fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify Bank against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to Bank in the
specified currency Bank agrees to remit such excess to the Borrowers.    If, as a result of the implementation of the European monetary union, (i) any
Agreed Foreign Currency ceases to be lawful currency of the nation issuing the same and is replaced by the Euro, or (ii) any Agreed Foreign Currency and the Euro are at the same time recognized by any governmental authority of the nation
issuing such currency as lawful currency of such nation and the Bank shall so request in a notice delivered to the Borrower Representative, then any amount payable hereunder by any party hereto in such Agreed Foreign Currency shall instead be
payable in the Euro and the amount so payable shall be determined by translating the amount payable in such Agreed Foreign Currency to the Euro at the exchange rate recognized by the European Central Bank for the purpose of implementing European
monetary union. Prior to the occurrence of the event or events described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence, each amount payable hereunder in any Agreed Foreign Currency will, except as otherwise provided herein, continue to
be payable only in that Agreed Foreign Currency.    Each Borrower agrees, at the request of the Bank to compensate the Bank for any loss, cost, expense or
reduction in return that the Bank shall reasonably determine shall be incurred or sustained by Bank as a result of the implementation of European monetary union and that would not have been incurred or sustained but for the transactions provided for
herein. A certificate of the Bank setting forth the Bank s determination of the amount or amounts necessary to compensate the Bank shall be delivered to the Borrower Representative and shall be conclusive absent manifest error so long as such
determination is made on a reasonable basis. The Borrowers shall pay the Bank the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.  
 Each Borrower agrees, at the time of or at any time following the implementation of any changes to the European monetary union, to use reasonable efforts to
enter into an agreement amending this Note in order to reflect the implementation of such changes, and to place the Bank and the Borrowers in the position with respect to the settlement of payments of the Euro as they would have been with respect to
the settlement of the Agreed Foreign Currency it replaced.    This Note has been delivered to and accepted by the Bank and will be deemed to be made in the
State where the Bank s office indicated above is located.  T HIS  N OTE   WILL   BE   INTERPRETED   AND   THE   RIGHTS   AND 
 LIABILITIES   OF   THE  B ANK   AND   THE  B ORROWERS   DETERMINED   IN   ACCORDANCE   WITH 
 THE   LAWS   OF   THE  S TATE   WHERE   THE  B ANK   S   OFFICE   INDICATED   ABOVE 
 IS   LOCATED ,  EXCLUDING   ITS   CONFLICT   OF   LAWS   RULES .  Each Borrower hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of
any state or federal court in the county or judicial district where the Bank s office indicated above is located; provided that nothing contained in this Note will prevent the Bank from bringing any action, enforcing any award or judgment or
exercising any rights against any Borrower individually, against any security or against any property of any Borrower within any other county, state or other foreign or domestic jurisdiction. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the venue
provided above is the most convenient forum for both the Bank and the Borrowers. Each Borrower waives any objection to venue and any objection based on a more convenient forum in any action instituted under this Note.  
      14
