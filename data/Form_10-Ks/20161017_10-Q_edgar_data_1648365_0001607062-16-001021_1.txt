NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Use
of estimates    

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from
these estimates.  

Revenue
recognition   

Revenue
is recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin  Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,  as revised
on SAB No. 104. As such, the Company recognizes revenue when work is done or services have been rendered.  

Specifically
for our business we considered recognizes revenue on the accrual basis, which considers revenue to be earned when the services
have been performed. Revenues are recognized when the rights and responsibility for IT or software product have passed to the
client. We considered gross revenue as a principal. Our revenue includes the gross amounts that come from Client for a software
development service.  

Cost

Our
service cost will consist primarily of the Intellectual work, time and expenses that we spent for service implement. If the
execution of the order we need to purchase additional hard, software or pay for some products,  it can be increase a
cost of service. In case when we hired the other contractor our expenses and service cost will be increase.

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED    

Net
income per common share    

Basic
income per common share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  

Cash
equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments to work in cash equivalent segment. The Company's bank accounts are deposited
in Chase financial institutions.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for its income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  The method of accounting
for income taxes under ASC 740 is an asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred
tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax bases and financial reporting
bases of other assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based
on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation
allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense
is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.  

NOTE
3   COMMON STOCK ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING

for $14,950  

NOTE
4   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.  

NOTE
5   CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK   

The
Company maintains cash balances at the Chase bank. The balance, at any given time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
( FDIC ) insurance limits of $250,000 per institution. The Company s cash balances at Aeptember 30, 2016 were
within FDIC insured limits.   

NOTE
6   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

time to time, the Company may become subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of its
business. The Company is not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, nor is the Company aware of any other pending

   NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   

NOTE
7   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY   

From
the Company s inception on February 17, 2015 through September 30, 2016, the Company has issued 51,495,000 shares of common
stock.  

NOTE
8   GOING CONCERN    

The
accompanying financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  

For
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company had revenue $28,829 and working capital of $19,519. The Company s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably
or raise additional capital through debt financing and/or through sales of common stock.  

Management
plans to fund operations of the Company through the proceeds from an offering pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1
or private placements of restricted securities.  

Management
believes that the Company s capital requirements will depend on many factors including the success of the Company s
development efforts and its efforts to raise capital. Management also believes the Company needs to raise additional capital for
working purposes. There is no assurance that such financing will be available in the future.   The conditions described
above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern.  

NOTE
9   INCOME TAXES   

On
September 30,2016 the company paid $911 income tax for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.  

NOTE
10   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS    

The
Company has evaluated events subsequent through the date these financial statements have been issued to assess the need for potential
recognition or disclosure in this report. Such events were evaluated through the date these financial statements were available
to be issued. Based upon this evaluation, it was determined that no subsequent events occurred, other than noted in the paragraph
above, that require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.  

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations.   

Forward-Looking
Statements   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q
(the  Report ). This Report contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or our future financial
performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   should, 
 expects,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts, 
 potential  or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements
are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance
or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  

For
a description of such risks and uncertainties, refer to Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on 07/24/2015. While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good
faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will always vary, sometimes materially,
from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein.  

Except
as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking
statements to conform these statements to actual results.  

Business
Overview    

We
were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 17, 2015. Our general business strategy is to develop and become a company
that provides better search engine optimization ( SEO ) software and techniques to smaller clients. We will be actively
engaged in in providing high impact internet marketing strategies to small internet based businesses and people seeking to create
websites. We believe that there is a niche in this area as smaller companies are not coveted by the big internet advertising firms
and they cannot afford to pay the higher fees demanded by large SEO web design companies.  

We
are an early stage development business with limited revenue generating options. The company will use a variety of online marketing
tools and channels including: Our website (iweblife.com) is the first step of implementing our business. Our website is complete
and will update as the implementation of new orders. IWEB services available will be described on our website and our own design
will show potential customers what we are capable of producing, we will also post our clients information as examples of other
work we have completed. Social media has currently proven itself the most cost-effective and efficient medium to communicate with
potential customers and to get the Company name and services noticed by potential customers. Due to the popularity of social media
we will also use all sources of social media marketing that are available to us. This will also allow us to show our potential
clients our ability to design and create, through the use of our social media account designs and website links.  

We
are working with any clients around the world and for now we have several international clients. Also we continue search for new
domestic clients. Also we plan on establishing relationships with small businesses and through professional networking using the
Internet and various community meetings and trade shows. In the future, our marketing teams will create a virtual network with
our potential customers. Networking will be very helpful in bringing us references of potential clients and spreading information
about our web design, advertising and SEO abilities by word of mouth. Our ability to generate advertising and referral revenue
will be due n large part to our ability to get traffic to our website and social media.  

Results
of Operations For the three months ending September 30, 2016    

Revenues  

  We
generated revenues of $28,829 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. We generated revenues for the three-month period
ending September 30, 2015 of $7,700.  

Total
operating expenses  

  During
the three-month periods ending September 30, 2016 our total operating expenses were $11,270 and $10,525 during the three-month
periods ending September 30, 2015. Our operating expenses consisted of legal, audit, tax, payment to contractor and other general
administrative expenses.  

Net
Profit/Loss  

  During
the three-month periods ending September 30, 2016 we had a profit $17,559 and during the three-month periods ending September
30, 2015 we had a loss $(2,825)  

Going
Concern Consideration   

Our
auditor's report dated August 25, 2016 consolidated that the Company has limited working capital.  

  These
matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

  Our
last three months reflect net loss and our capital resources are reduced.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

For
the three-month ended September 30, 2016 we had positive working capital of $19,519 in cash. We received this capital as payments
from our clients. We expect to spend this capital to develop and grow the business and payments to contractor.  

  As
of September 30, 2015, we had cash of $4,145. Cash used in operating activities for the three-month ended September 30, 2015 consisted
of our net loss of $2,825.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital
resources that are material to investors.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

We
are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide the information under this item pursuant to Reg. S-K.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

As
of the end of the period covered by this Report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
1934 Act). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, there have been no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting
during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of management s last evaluation.

ACT OF 2002   

I,
Dmitriy Kolyvayko, certify that:  

1.  
      I
    have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of IWEB.INC;   

2.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
    fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading
    with respect to the period covered by this quarterly report;   

3.  
      Based
    on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present
    in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Small Business Issuer as of,
    and for, the periods presented in this quarterly report;   

4.  
      I
    am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
    and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for
    the Small Business Issuer and have:   

(a)  
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision,
    to ensure that material information relating to the small business issuer, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
    known to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

(b)  
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision,
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

(c)  
      Evaluated
    the effectiveness of the Small Business Issuer s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my
    conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this
    report based on such evaluation; and   

(d)  
      Disclosed
    in this report any change in the Small Business Issuer s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
    the small business issuer's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the small business issuer's internal control over financial reporting.   

5.  
      I
    have disclosed, based on a most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the small business issuer's
    auditors of the small business issuer's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

(a)  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the small business issuer's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
    information; and   

(b)  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the small business
    issuer's internal control over financial reporting.
