   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     
   SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   
   (UNAUDITED)   
     
   NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
     
  The  accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company  or  Emmaus ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company s unaudited consolidated interim financial statements contain adjustments, including normal recurring accruals necessary to present fairly the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows. Due to the uncertainty of the Company s ability to meet its current operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, as the continuation and expansion of its business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, successful and sufficient market acceptance of its products, and finally, achieving a profitable level of operations. The consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. The consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on May 20, 2016 (the  Annual Report ). Interim results for the periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. 
     
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of management estimates. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  
     
   NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
     
  Refer  to the Annual Report for a summary of significant accounting policies. There have been no material changes to the Company s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Below are disclosures of certain interim balances, transactions, and significant assumptions used in computing fair value as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and comparative amounts from the prior fiscal periods: 
     
   Inventories     All of the raw material purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 was from one vendor. The below table presents inventory by category: 

Advertising cost     Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $9,101 and $11,720, respectively. Advertising costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $24,540 and $47,955, respectively. 
     
   Marketable securities     The Company s marketable securities consist of 39,250 shares of CellSeed, Inc. ( CellSeed ) stock which are part of 147,100 shares acquired in January 2009 for 100,028,000 Japanese Yen (equivalent to $1,109,819), at 680 Yen per share. CellSeed s IPO (Tokyo Stock Exchange symbol 7776) was completed on March 16, 2010. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the closing price per share for CellSeed was 581 Yen ($5.74) and 672 Yen ($5.58), respectively. 
     
   As of September 30, 2016, 39,250 shares of CellSeed stock are pledged to secure a  $300,000 convertible  note issued to Mitsubishi UFJ Capital III Limited Partnership that is due on demand and are classified as current assets, as marketable securities, pledged to creditor. 
     
   Prepaid expenses and other current assets     Prepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

The value of the liability classified warrants, the value of warrant derivative liabilities and the change in fair value of the liability classified warrants and warrant derivative liabilities were determined using a Binomial Monte-Carlo Cliquet (aka  Ratchet ) Option Pricing Model. The model is similar to traditional Black-Scholes-type option pricing models, except that the exercise price resets at certain dates in the future. T he values as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and the initial value as of September 11, 2013 were calculated based on the following assumptions:  

The values of lender equity classified warrants as of September 30, 2016, May 13, 2016 and April 18, 2016 were calculated based on the following assumptions:

   Debt and related party debt     The following table presents the effective interest rates on the original loan principal amount for loans originated in the respective periods that either had a beneficial conversion feature or an attached warrant: 

Related party notes are disclosed as separate line items in the Company s balance sheet.  
     
   Net loss per share     As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, potentially dilutive securities exercisable or convertible into 14,859,090 and 11,311,625 shares of Company common stock were outstanding. As the Company reported a net loss, none of the potentially dilutive securities were included in the calculation of diluted loss per share since their effect would be anti-dilutive for all periods presented. 
     
   Recent accounting pronouncements     In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The amendments applicable to the Company in this Update (1) supersede the guidance to classify equity securities, except equity method securities, with readily determinable fair values into trading or available-for-sale categories and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income, (2) allow equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values to be remeasured at fair value either upon the occurrence of an observable price change or upon identification of an impairment, (3) require assessment for impairment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values qualitatively at each reporting period, (4) eliminate the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used in calculating the fair value of financial instruments required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, (5) require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, (6) require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements, (7) clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. The amendments in this Update are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. The amendments should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the Update. The impact of the adoption of the amendments in this Update will depend on the amount of equity securities and financial instruments subject to the amendments in this Update held by the Company at the time of adoption. 
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases . The amendments in this Update require a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. For leases less than twelve months, an entity is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The amendments in this Update are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the amendments in this Update on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations; however, adoption of the amendments in this Update are expected to be material for most entities who have a material lease with a term of greater than twelve months.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including: income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This Update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating this new Update.

  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-10 clarify identification of performance obligations and licensing implementation. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606: For public companies, this Update is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the implementation of ASU 2016-10 will have on the Company s financial statements.  
     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the following eight specific cash flow classification issues: (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; (6) distributions received from equity method investees; (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and (8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. Current GAAP does not include specific guidance on these eight cash flow classification issues. The amendments of this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on its financial statements.

   NOTE 5   NOTES PAYABLE   
     
  In April and May of 2016, the Company entered into secured loan agreements pursuant to which it borrowed an aggregate amount of $1,295,000 at a fixed interest rate of 10% per annum. These loans will mature on the earlier of the closing of a new debt financing (subject to certain exceptions, including refinancings of its outstanding convertible notes) or May 1, 2017. These loans are secured by all of the Company s personal property and are personally guaranteed by Dr. Niihara, its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and secured by certain of his real property. Furthermore, the loan agreements contain certain negative covenants that may hinder the Company s ability to raise additional capital or might otherwise affect its liquidity, including restrictions on its ability to (1) acquire material assets outside of the ordinary course of business, (2) sell, lease, license transfer or dispose of its personal property outside of the ordinary course of business, (3) pay or declare dividends, (4) make investments in or loans to other persons, (5) redeem or repurchase its stock, (6) make deposits or investments unless they are subject to a deposit control account, (7) incur additional indebtedness other than permitted debt, (8) make payments on subordinated obligations, (9) undergo a merger, change in control or sale of a substantial portion of its assets, or (10) use loan proceeds to make payments to its affiliates. If the Company is unable to repay these loans when they become due, or if it otherwise suffers an event of default under the loan agreements, the lender may have the right to foreclose on its collateral, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, liquidity and operations.  
     
  In connection with these loans, the Company issued the lender warrants for the purchase of 62,500 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of the lowest of the fair market value of the common stock during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 or the lowest public sale price of the common stock during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. In addition, if these loans remain outstanding for at least 30 days during the 90-day periods ending June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, the Company is obligated to issue the lender additional warrants for the purchase of 37,500, 18,750 and 18,750 shares of Company common stock, respectively, for an exercise price of the lowest of the fair market value of the common stock as of the start or end of such 90-day period or the lowest public sale price of the common stock during the quarter ended on the applicable measurement date. As these loans have been outstanding for more than 30 days during the 90-day period ending June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, the Company accordingly issued the lender additional warrants for the purchase of 37,500 and 18,750 shares, respectively, of Company common stock on the terms set forth above. These warrants may be exercised through a cashless exercise feature.  
     
  In August and September 2016, the Company issued convertible notes to third parties totaling $1,221,600 in aggregate principal amount, which notes bear interest at 10% per annum starting from October 1, 2016 and mature on the respective one-year anniversary dates of the notes. If the Company completes the listing on the OTC market, the principal amount of the notes will automatically convert into shares of Company common stock at a fixed conversion price of $4.50 (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar transactions with respect to the capital stock of the Company). Within thirty days of such closing, all accrued and unpaid interest on the notes, if any, will be payable to the holders in cash. At or after the first anniversary of the loan dates, the holders of the notes may convert some or all of the unpaid principal amount of the notes, including unpaid accrued interest, into shares of Company common stock at a conversion price of $4.50 per share.  
     
  On August 26, 2016, the Company offered all of its note holders an opportunity to convert all or a portion of the principal amount of and accrued interest on their notes into shares of Company common stock at a price of $3.50 per share. Pursuant to the offer, 19 note holders elected to convert a total of $4,007,598 of principal and $260,124 of accrued interest on their notes into an aggregate of 1,219,350 shares of our common stock.  
     
  The conversion price of $3.50 per share was less than the stated conversion price of the convertible notes that were converted, which conversion prices ranged from $4.50 to $7.00 per share. Accordingly, the conversion resulted in the Company recognizing an inducement expense of $1,444,863, which represents the fair value of the incremental increase in the number of shares of Company common stock received by the convertible note holders.  
     
  The note holders of a total of $622,384 of principal and accrued interest on non-convertible notes participated in the offer. Under the guidance of ASC 405-20, the Company de-recognized the principal and accrued interest on these non-convertible notes in consideration for issuing Company common stock. As a result of delivering its common stock to the holders of these non-convertible notes holders, the Company concluded that it has satisfied and is released from its legal obligation for the notes. The fair value of the common stock provided as consideration was $889,120 whereas the face value of the principal and accrued interest was $622,384, resulting in a loss on the debt settlement of $266,736 charged in full against the earning during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

  The average stated interest rate of notes payable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 10%. The average effective interest rate of notes payable for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 was 26% and 23% respectively, after giving effect to discounts relating to beneficial conversion features and the fair value of warrants issued in connection with these notes. The notes payable and convertible notes payable do not have restrictive financial covenants or acceleration clauses associated with a material adverse change event. The holders of the convertible notes have the option to convert their notes into Company common stock at the stated conversion price during the term of their convertible notes. Conversion prices on these convertible notes payable range from $3.05 to $3.60 per share. Certain notes with a $4.50 or a $7.00 stated conversion price in the second year of their two-year term are subject to automatic conversion into shares of Company common stock at a conversion price equal to 80% of the initial public offering price at the time of a qualified public offering. All due on demand notes are treated as current liabilities.  
     
  Contractual principal payments due on notes payable are as follows:  

The Company estimated the total fair value of any beneficial conversion feature and accompanying warrants in allocating the debt proceeds. The proceeds allocated to the beneficial conversion feature were determined by taking the estimated fair value of shares issuable under the convertible notes less the fair value of the number of shares that would be issued if the conversion rate equaled the fair value of Company common stock as of the date of issuance (see Note 2). The fair value of the warrants issued in conjunction with notes was determined using the Black Scholes Merton Option Pricing Model with the following inputs for the periods ended:  

In situations where the notes included both a beneficial conversion feature and a warrant, the proceeds were allocated to the warrants and beneficial conversion feature based on their respective pro rata fair values.  
     
   NOTE 6   STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT   
     
   Private placement     On September 11, 2013, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,020,501 units at a price of $2.50 per unit (the  Private Placement ). Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one common stock warrant for the purchase of an additional share of common stock. The aggregate purchase price for the units was $7,551,253. In addition, 300,000 warrants for the purchase of a share of common stock were issued to a broker under the same terms as the Private Placement transaction (the  Broker Warrants ). 
     
  The warrants issued in the Private Placement and the Broker Warrants entitle the holders thereof to purchase, at any time on or prior to September 11, 2018, shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $3.50 per share. The warrants contain non-standard anti-dilution protection and, consequently, are being accounted for as liabilities, were originally recorded at fair value, and are adjusted to fair market value each reporting period. Because the shares of common stock underlying the Private Placement warrants and Broker Warrants were not effectively registered for resale by September 11, 2014, the warrant holders have an option to exercise the warrants using a cashless exercise feature. The shares have not been registered for resale as of September 30, 2016. The availability to warrant holders of the cashless exercise feature as of September 11, 2014 caused the then-outstanding 2,225,036 Private Placement warrants and Broker Warrants with fair value of $7,068,000 to be reclassified from liability classified warrants to warrant derivative liabilities and to continue to be remeasured at fair value each reporting period.  On June 10, 2014, certain warrant holders exercised 1,095,465 warrants issued in the Private Placement for the exercise price of $3.50 per share, resulting in the Company receiving aggregate exercise proceeds of $3.8 million and issuing 1,095,465 shares of common stock. Prior to exercise, these Private Placement warrants were accounted for at fair value as liability classified warrants. As of June 10, 2014, immediately prior to exercise, the carrying value of these Private Placement warrants was reduced to their fair value immediately prior to exercise of $1.8 million, representing their intrinsic value, with this adjusted carrying value of $1.8 million being transferred to additional paid-in capital. Also on June 10, 2014, based on an offer made to holders of Private Placement warrants in connection with such exercises, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,095,465 replacement warrants to holders exercising Private Placement warrants, which replacement warrants have terms that are generally the same as the exercised warrants, including an expiration date of September 11, 2018 and an exercise price of $3.50 per share.

Table of Contents   
     
  The replacement warrants are treated for accounting purposes as liability classified warrants, and their issuance gave rise to a $3.5 million warrant exercise inducement expense based on their fair value as of issuance as determined using a Binomial Monte-Carlo Cliquet (aka Ratchet) Option Pricing Model.  Because the shares of common stock underlying the replacement warrants were not effectively registered for resale by June 10, 2015, the warrant holders have an option to exercise the warrants using a cashless exercise feature. The shares have not been registered for resale as of September 30, 2016. The availability to warrant holders of the cashless exercise feature as of June 10, 2015 caused the then-outstanding 1,095,465 replacement warrants with fair value of $2,545,000 to be reclassified from liability classified warrants to warrant derivative liabilities and to continue to be remeasured at fair value each reporting period. 
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate fair value of the Private Placement warrants, replacement warrants, and the Broker Warrants was $7,779,000 (see Note 2). For further details regarding registration rights associated with the Private Placement warrants, replacement warrants and Broker Warrants, see the Registration Rights section below in this footnote.

A summary of outstanding warrants by year issued and exercise price as of  September 30, 2016  is presented below: 

Stock options     During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors granted 2,596,200 stock options to its officers, directors and employees. Of these options, 300,000 granted to its directors will vest in equal one-third installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, have an exercise price of $4.70 per share and are exercisable through 2026. The remaining 2,296,200 options will vest as follows: one-third (1/3) will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, and the remaining two-thirds (2/3) will vest in twenty-four approximately equal monthly installments over a period of two years thereafter, except for 300,000 options granted to its directors which will vest in equal one-third installments over three years starting May 10, 2017. These options have an exercise price of $5.00 per share and are exercisable through 2026. During the year ended December 31, 2015, no options were granted by the Company s Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2016, there were 6,955,200 options outstanding under the Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $2.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense arising from stock options. As of September 30, 2016, there was $9.1 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. That expense is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining period of 2.3 years.  
     
   Registration rights     Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements relating to the Private Placement and certain warrants, as well as pursuant to the replacement of certain warrants by the Company on June 10, 2014, the Company agreed to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to have on file with the SEC, by September 11, 2014 and at the Company s sole expense, a registration statement to permit the public resale of 4,115,966 shares of Company common stock and 3,320,501 shares of common stock underlying warrants (collectively, the  Registrable Securities ). In the event such registration statement includes securities to be offered and sold by the Company in a fully underwritten primary public offering pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and the Company is advised in good faith by any managing underwriter of securities being offered pursuant to such registration statement that the number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in such offering is greater than the number of such securities which can be included in such offering without materially adversely affecting such offering, the Company will include in such registration the following securities in the following order of priority: (i) any securities the Company proposes to sell, and (ii) the Registrable Securities, with any reductions in the number of Registrable Securities actually included in such registration to be allocated on a pro rata basis among the holders thereof. The registration rights described above apply until all Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or may be sold without registration in reliance on Rule 144 under the Securities Act without limitation as to volume and without the requirement of any notice filing. If the shares of common stock underlying these warrants to purchase 3,320,501 shares are not registered for resale at the time of exercise, and the registration rights described above then apply with respect to the holder of such warrants, such holder may exercise such warrants on a cashless basis. In such a cashless exercise of all the shares covered by the warrant, the warrant holder would receive a number of shares equal to the quotient of (i) the difference between the fair market value of the common stock, as defined, and the $3.50 exercise price, as adjusted, multiplied by the number of shares exercisable under the warrant, divided by (ii) the fair market value of the common stock, as defined. As of September 30, 2016, based on a fair market value of a share of Company common stock of $5.00 and 3,320,501 warrants issued and outstanding and eligible for cashless exercise, the maximum number of shares the Company would be required to issue, if the warrant holders elected to exercise the cashless exercise feature with respect to all then eligible warrants, is 996,150 shares. If the fair market value of a share of Company common stock were to increase by $1.00 from $5.00 to $6.00, the maximum number of shares the Company would be required to issue, if the warrant holders elected to exercise the cashless exercise feature with respect to all then eligible warrants, would increase to 1,383,542 shares as of September 30, 2016. 
     
  The Company has not yet filed a registration statement with respect to the resale of the Registrable Securities. The Company believes that it has used commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement with respect to the resale of Registrable Securities.  
     
   Korean Private Placement     On September 12, 2016, the Company entered into Letter of Agreement with KPM Tech Co., Ltd. ( KPM ) and Hanil Vacuum Co., Ltd. ( Hanil ), both Korean-based public companies whose shares are listed on KOSDAQ, a trading board of Korea Exchange in South Korea. In the Letter of Agreement, the parties agreed that KPM and Hanil would purchase by September 30, 2016 $17 million and $3 million, respectively, of shares of our common stock at a price of $4.50 per share. In exchange, the Company agreed to invest $13 million and $1 million in future capital increases by KPM and Hanil, respectively, at prices based upon the trading prices of KPM and Hanil shares on KOSDAQ. The Letter of Agreement contemplates that KPM and Hanil may purchase additional shares of our common stock in a second transaction to be mutually agreed upon by the parties. In connection with the Letter of Agreement, KPM and Hanil entered into our standard form subscription agreement with respect to their purchase of shares which contains customary representations and warranties of the parties.

  On September 29, 2016, KPM and Hanil purchased and acquired from the Company 3,777,778 shares and 666,667 shares, respectively, of common stock at a price of $4.50 a share for $17 million and $3 million, respectively, for a gross total of $20 million. The Company recognized $720,000 as a reduction to its additional paid-in-capital for fees and commissions payable by the Company in connection with the transaction.  
     
  Pursuant to the Letter of Agreement dated September 12, 2016, the Company intends to invest $13 million and $1 million in future capital increases by KPM and Hanil, respectively, at prices based upon the trading prices of KPM and Hanil shares on KOSDAQ. Accordingly, the Company allocated $13 million and $1 million for a total of $14 million from the funds received from KPM and Hanil on September 29, 2016 for $17 million and $3 million, respectively, as an investment capital reserve on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  Pursuant to the terms of a subscription agreement dated as of September 11, 2013 among the Company and certain purchasers of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, the purchasers are entitled to participation rights with respect to the sale of shares pursuant to the Letter of Agreement. To the extent the purchasers exercise their participation rights, we may be obliged to sell to them a specified number of shares of our common stock at the price per share and other terms set forth in the Letter of Agreement. There can be no assurance that any purchaser will exercise its participation rights or that any shares of our common stock will be issued to any purchaser.  
     
  Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and pursuant to the terms of the Letter of Agreement dated September 12, 2016, the Company invested $13 million and $1 million in capital increases by KPM and Hanil, respectively, at $15.32 and $3.68, respectively, per capita share.  
     
  On August 26, 2016, the Company offered all note holders an opportunity to convert all or a portion of the principal amount of and accrued interest on their notes into shares of Company common stock at a price of $3.50 per share. Pursuant to the offer, 19 note holders elected to convert a total of $4,007,598 of principal and $260,124 of accrued interest on their notes.  
     
  The conversion price of $3.50 per share was less than the stated conversion price of the convertible notes that were converted, which conversion prices ranged from $4.50 to $7.00 per share. Accordingly, the conversion resulted in the Company recognizing an inducement expense of $1,444,863, which represents the fair value of the incremental increase in the number of shares of Company common stock received by the convertible note holders.  
     
  The note holders of a total of $622,384 of principal and accrued interest on non-convertible notes participated in the offer. Under the guidance of ASC 405-20, the Company de-recognized the principal and accrued interest on these non-convertible notes in consideration for issuing Company common stock. As a result of delivering its common stock to the holders of these non-convertible notes holders, the Company concluded that it has satisfied and is released from its legal obligation for the notes. The fair value of the common stock provided as consideration was $889,120 whereas the face value of the principal and accrued interest was $622,384, resulting in a loss on the debt settlement of $266,736 charged in full against the earning during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

   Company Overview   
     
  We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies primarily for rare and orphan diseases. We are initially focusing our product development efforts on SCD, a genetic disorder and a significant unmet medical need. Our lead product candidate is an oral pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment that demonstrated positive clinical results in our completed Phase 3 clinical trial for sickle cell anemia and sickle  0-thalassemia, two of the most common forms of SCD.  
     
  On September 7, 2016 we submitted a New Drug Application ( NDA ) to the FDA requesting U.S. marketing approval for our orally-administered pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD and the NDA has been accepted for review.  
     
  The NDA represents the first potential treatment for pediatric patients with SCD, and the first potential new treatment in nearly 20 years for adult patients. Our SCD therapy has Orphan Drug and Fast Track designation from the FDA. We are awaiting notice from the FDA regarding the request for a priority review.  
     
  Orphan Medicinal Product designation in the European Union has also been granted for the L-glutamine treatment for SCD. We plan to submit a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency.  
     
  We plan to market our L-glutamine treatment in the United States, if approved, by either strategic partnership or by building our own targeted sales force of approximately 30 sales representatives. We intend to utilize strategic partnerships to market our treatment in the rest of the world, if and when approved for marketing.  
     
  We have extensive experience in the field of SCD, including the development, outsourced manufacturing and conduct of clinical trials of our prescription grade L-glutamine product candidate for the treatment of SCD. Yutaka Niihara, M.D., M.P.H., is a leading hematologist in the field of SCD. Dr. Niihara is licensed to practice medicine in both the United States and Japan and has been actively engaged in SCD research and the care of patients with SCD for over 20 years, primarily at the University of California Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute ( LA BioMed ), a nonprofit biomedical research institute at Harbor UCLA Medical Center.  
     
  To a lesser extent, we are also engaged in the marketing and sale of NutreStore  L-glutamine powder for oral solution, which has received FDA approval, as a treatment for short bowel syndrome ( SBS ) in patients receiving specialized nutritional support when used in conjunction with a recombinant human growth hormone that is approved for this indication. Our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Newfield Nutrition , sells L-glutamine as a nutritional supplement under the brand name AminoPure  through retail stores in multiple states and via importers and distributors in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Since inception, we have generated minimal revenues from the sale and promotion of NutreStore  and AminoPure . 
     
  In May 2006, we formed Newfield Nutrition, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Emmaus Medical, that distributes L-glutamine as a nutritional supplement under the brand name AminoPure  . 
     
  In October 2010, we formed EM Japan, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Emmaus Medical, that markets and sells AminoPure   in Japan and other countries in Asia. EM Japan also manages our distributors in Japan and may also import other medical products and drugs in the future. 
     
  In November 2011, we formed EM Europe, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Emmaus Medical, whose primary focus is expanding our business in Europe.  
     
  Our corporate structure is illustrated below:

Table of Contents   
     
  Emmaus Medical, LLC was organized on December 20, 2000. In October 2003, Emmaus Medical, LLC undertook a reorganization and merged with Emmaus Medical, which was originally incorporated in September 2003.  
     
  Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 21, 2011, which we refer to as the Merger Agreement, by and among us, AFH Merger Sub, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, which we refer to as AFH Merger Sub, AFH Advisory and Emmaus Medical, Emmaus Medical merged with and into AFH Merger Sub on May 3, 2011 with Emmaus Medical continuing as the surviving entity, which we refer to as the Merger. Upon the closing of the Merger, we changed our name from  AFH Acquisition IV, Inc.  to  Emmaus Holdings, Inc.  Subsequently, on September 14, 2011, we changed our name from  Emmaus Holdings, Inc.  to  Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc.   
     
  Our future capital requirements are substantial and may increase beyond our current expectations depending on many factors, including, but not limited to: the duration and results of the clinical trials for our various products candidates going forward; unexpected delays or developments when seeking regulatory approvals; the time and cost in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims; current and future unexpected developments encountered in implementing our business development and commercialization strategies; the outcome of litigation  in which we may become engaged in the future; and further arrangements, if any, with collaborators. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, future cash requirements are expected to be financed through registered or unregistered equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. As of September 30, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $98.6 million and we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.6 million. Since inception we have had minimal revenues and have been required to rely on funding from sales of equity securities and borrowings from officers and stockholders. 
     
  We also own a minority interest of less than 1% in CellSeed, Inc., a Japanese company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is engaged in research and development of regenerative medicine products and the manufacture and sale of temperature-responsive cell culture equipment. In collaboration with CellSeed, we are engaged in research and development of cell sheet engineering regenerative medicine products.  
     
  Subsequent to September 30, 2016, we acquired a minority interest of 8.2% in KPM Tech Co., Ltd., and of 0.8% in Hanil Vacuum Co., Ltd., both Korean-based public companies whose shares are listed on KOSDAQ, a trading board of Korea Exchange in South Korea. KPM is principally engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of surface treatment chemicals. Hanil is principally engaged in the design, manufacturing and sale of vacuum coating systems.  
     
   Financial Overview   
     
   Revenue   
     
  S ince our inception in 2000, we have had limited revenue from the sale of NutreStore , an FDA-approved prescription drug to treat SBS and AminoPure , a nutritional supplement. We have funded operations principally through the private placement of equity securities and debt financings. Our operations to date have been primarily limited to staffing, licensing and promoting products for SBS, outsourcing distribution and sales activities, developing and sponsoring clinical trials of our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD, manufacturing products and maintaining and improving our patent portfolio. 
     
  Currently, we generate revenue through the  sale of NutreStore  L-glutamine powder for oral solution as a treatment for SBS as well as AminoPure . Pursuant to the exclusive sublicense agreement for US Patent No. 5,288,703, we are required to pay an annual royalty equal to 10% of adjusted gross sales of NutreStore  to CATO Holding Company ( CATO ). Management expects that any revenues generated from the sale of NutreStore  and AminoPure  will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the timing of orders and the amount of product sold. 
     
   Cost of Goods Sold   
     
  C ost of goods sold includes the raw materials, packaging, shipping and distribution costs of NutreStore  and AminoPure .

   Research and Development Expenses   
     
  R esearch and development costs consist of expenditures for new products and technologies, which primarily involve fees paid to the contract research organizations ( CRO ) that conduct the clinical trials of our product candidates, payroll-related expenses, study site payments, consultant fees, and activities related to regulatory filings, manufacturing development costs and other related supplies. The costs of later-stage clinical studies, such as Phase 2 and 3 trials, are generally higher than those of earlier stages of development, such as preclinical studies and Phase 1 trials. This is primarily due to the increased size, expanded scope, patient related healthcare and regulatory compliance costs, and generally longer duration of later-stage clinical studies. 
     
  The most significant clinical trial expenditures in prior years have been related to the CRO costs and the payments to study sites. The contract with the CRO is based on time and material expended, whereas the study site agreements are based on per patient costs as well as other pass-through costs, including, but not limited to, start-up costs and institutional review board fees. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones.  
     
  Future research and development expenses will depend on any new product candidates or technologies that we may introduce into our research and development pipeline. In addition, we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree, if any, such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.  
     
  At this time, due to the inherently unpredictable nature of the process for developing drugs, biologics and cell-based therapies and the interpretation of the regulatory requirements, we are unable to estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of costs which will be incurred in obtaining FDA approval of our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD and the continued development of our other preclinical and clinical programs. Clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations and can vary widely. These and other risks and uncertainties relating to product development are described in the Annual Report under the headings  Risk Factors Risks Related to Development of our Product Candidates,   Risk Factors Risks Related to our Reliance on Third Parties,  and  Risk Factors Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters.   
     
  We estimate that the cost to us to develop in the United States corneal cell sheet products based on Cultured Autologous Oral Mucosal Epithelial Cell-Sheets ( CAOMECS ) technology will be approximately $3.0 million. This estimate includes the anticipated cost of obtaining FDA approval for the corneal cell sheets and assumes that we will need the FDA to approve a Biologic License Application ( BLA ) for the corneal cell sheets, rather than an NDA. We estimate that we will need another $2.4 million to commercialize any approved products based on corneal cell sheet technology.  
     
  In addition, we estimate that we will need $2.5 million for research related to other cell sheet applications and to build a current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMP ) laboratory to establish the infrastructure and production capabilities related to regenerative medicine products. At this time, we do not plan to incur any research and development costs for our NutreStore  and AminoPure  products.  
     
   General and Administrative Expenses   
     
  G eneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, business development, information technology, marketing and legal functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs, patent filing costs and professional fees and expenses for legal, consulting, auditing and tax services. Inflation has not had a material impact on our general and administrative expenses over the past two years. 
     
   Environmental Expenses   
     
  The  cost of compliance with environmental laws has not been material over the past two years and any such costs are included in general and administrative costs. 
     
   Inventories   
     
  I nventories consist of finished goods and work-in-process and are valued on a first-in, first-out basis and at the lower of cost or market value. All of the raw material purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were from one vendor.

   Results of Operations   
     
   Three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
     
   Net    Losses . Net losses increased by $2.8 million, or 82%, to $6.3 million from $3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in losses is primarily a result of increased other expenses and operating expenses, in each case as discussed below. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $98.6 million. Losses, partially offset by revenue from commercialized products, will continue as we advance our sickle cell treatment toward potential regulatory approval and commercialization. As a result, we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses and be unprofitable for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that we will ever operate at a profit, even if all of our products are commercialized. 
     
   Revenues, Net  . Net revenues decreased by $15,000, or 20%, to $62,000 from $77,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Combined revenues from our AminoPure  L-glutamine nutritional supplement product and our NutreStore  L-glutamine powder for oral solution for treatment of SBS remained at the same level during these periods. 
     
   Cost of Goods Sold  . Cost of goods sold decreased by $16,000, or 43%, to $21,000 from $37,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Cost of goods sold includes costs for raw material, packaging, testing, shipping and costs related to scrapped inventory. All of the raw material purchased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was from one vendor. Cost of goods sold decreased due to increased sales in direct sales, which has a higher gross profit margin, associated with our AminoPure  L-glutamine nutritional supplement product. 
     
   Research and Development Expenses  . Research and development expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 21%, to $0.4 million from $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our preparation of NDA submission activities. We expect our research and development costs to remain at the same level in the rest of 2016 to support our NDA post-submission activities, work on marketing approvals outside the US and potentially future clinical trial activity. 
     
   Selling Expenses  . Selling expenses increased by $23,000, or 28%, from $81,000 to $104,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Selling expenses includes the costs for distribution, promotion, travel, tradeshows and exhibits related to NutreStore  and AminoPure  as well as the marketing and branding expenses for our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD. The increase was due to an increase in the branding cost of our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD as we approach the potential regulatory approval and commercialization. 
     
   General and Administrative Expenses.   General and administrative expenses increased by $0.5 million, or 22%, to $2.7 million from $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. General and administrative expenses include share-based compensation expenses, professional fees, office rent and payroll expenses. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.5 million in share-based compensation expense due to issuance of stock options and a $0.1 million increase in office rent expenses, partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in professional fees. 
     
   Other Income and Expense  . Total other expense increased by $2.4 million, or 313%, to $3.2 million expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.8 million expense for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in convertible note inducement expense, a $0.7 million increase in interest costs as a result of increased debt and a $0.3 million increase in loss on debt settlement from promissory note conversion into Company common stock. 
     
  We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase for, among others, the following reasons:  
     
                        as a result of increased payroll, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal, accounting and investor relations costs, and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company; 
     
                        to support research and development activities, which we expect to expand as development of our product candidate(s) continues and the post-submission activities of an NDA for pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD; and 
     
                        to build a sales and marketing team before we receive regulatory approval of a product candidate in anticipation of commercial launch. 
     
   Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
     
   Net    Losses . Net losses increased by $5.5 million, or 66%, to $13.9 million from $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in losses is primarily a result of increased other expenses, partially offset by decreased operating expenses, in each case as discussed below. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $98.6 million. Losses, partially offset by revenue from commercialized products, will continue as we advance our sickle cell treatment toward potential regulatory approval and commercialization. As a result, we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses and be unprofitable for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that we will ever operate at a profit, even if all of our products are commercialized.

Table of Contents   
     
   Revenues, Net  . Net revenues remained approximately the same at $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Combined revenues from our AminoPure  L-glutamine nutritional supplement product and our NutreStore  L-glutamine powder for oral solution for treatment of SBS remained at the same level during these periods. 
     
   Cost of Goods Sold  . Cost of goods sold decreased by $18,000, or 12%, to $132,000 from $150,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Cost of goods sold includes costs for raw material, packaging, testing, shipping and costs related to scrapped inventory. All of the raw material purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was from one vendor. 
     
   Research and Development Expenses  . Research and development expenses increased by $0.4 million, or 44%, to $1.4 million from $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in our preparation of NDA submission activities. We expect our research and development costs to continue through the rest of 2016 to support our NDA post-submission activities, work on marketing approvals outside the US and potentially future clinical trial activity. 
     
   Selling Expenses  . Selling expenses decreased by $44,000, or 13%, to $282,000 from $326,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 due primarily to a decrease in marketing, advertising and travel expenses. Selling expenses includes the costs for distribution, promotion, travel, tradeshows and exhibits related to NutreStore  and AminoPure  as well as the marketing and branding expenses for our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD. 
     
   General and Administrative Expenses.   General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.2 million, or 2%, to $7.2 million from $7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. General and administrative expenses include share-based compensation expenses, professional fees, office rent, and payroll expenses. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $1.2 million for share-based compensation due to expiration of certain options, partially offset by increases of $0.2 million for professional fees, $0.2 million for fund raising expenses including due diligence and account management fees, $0.1 million for office rent expenses and $0.1 million for insurance expenses. 
     
   Other Income and Expense  . Total other expense increased by $5.3 million, or 2,487%, to $5.1 million expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.2 million income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to absences of gain on derecognition of accounts payable and settlement of litigation of $0.4 million and change in fair value of liability classified warrants of $0.7 million, a negative change in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities of $1.4 million, $1.4 million of convertible note inducement expense, an increase in interest costs of $1.0 million as a result of increased debt and an increase in loss on debt settlement of $0.3 million for the promissory note conversion into Company common stock. 
     
  We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase for, among others, the following reasons:  
     
                        as a result of increased payroll, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal, accounting and investor relations costs, and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company; 
     
                        to support research and development activities, which we expect to expand as development of our product candidate(s) continues and the post-submission activities of an NDA for pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD; and 
     
                        to build a sales and marketing team before we receive regulatory approval of a product candidate in anticipation of commercial launch. 
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  B ased on our losses to date, anticipated future revenue and operating expenses, debt repayment obligations, investment commitment and cash and cash equivalents balance of $6.6 million as of September 30, 2016, we do not have sufficient operating capital for our business without raising additional capital. We incurred losses of $13.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and had an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016 of $98.6 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we incur expenses for post-submission activities of the NDA, the commercialization of our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment of SCD, research costs for the corneal cell sheets using CAOMECS technology and the expansion of corporate infrastructure, including costs associated with being a public reporting company and additional expenses that may be associated with pursuing a possible initial public offering. We have previously relied on unregistered equity offerings, debt financings and loans, including loans from related parties. As part of this effort, we have received various loans from officers, stockholders and other investors as discussed below. As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding notes payable in an aggregate principal amount of $19.2 million, consisting of $9.5 million of non-convertible promissory notes and $9.7 million of convertible notes. Of the $19.2 million aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding as of September 30, 2016, approximately $17.0 million is either due on demand or will become due and payable within the next twelve months. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies, including the commercialization of our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD and the development in the United States of CAOMECS-based cell sheet technology.

Table of Contents   
     
  We have had recurring operating losses, have a significant amount of notes payable and other obligations due within the next year and projected operating losses including the expected costs relating to the commercialization of our  pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD that exceed both the existing cash balances and cash expected to be generated from operations for at least the next year. In order to meet our expected obligations, management intends to raise additional funds through equity and debt financings. In addition, we may seek to raise additional funds through collaborations with other companies or financing from other sources and a possible initial public offering. Additional funding may not be available in amounts or on terms which are acceptable to us, if at all. Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
     
  In addition, we currently estimate that we will need an additional $0.9 million for our post-NDA submission expenses with the FDA  for our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment for SCD. Our cash burn rate for the first nine months ending September 30, 2016 was approximately $2.2 million per month. 
     
  As discussed in our Annual Report under the heading  Risk Factors Risks Related to Development of our Product Candidates,  if the FDA does not accept for filing our NDA for our pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine treatment or does not approve our NDA based on a single Phase 3 clinical trial, in each case unless we conduct a second Phase 3 clinical trial or confirmatory study, the potential approval of our product candidate will be delayed. Under these circumstances, we will incur additional costs to seek to convince the FDA that a confirmatory study is unnecessary for filing or approval, or to design and conduct a second Phase 3 clinical trial or confirmatory study, or both. If we conduct a second Phase 3 clinical trial or confirmatory study prior to the approval of our NDA, it is possible that the results of that trial will be less favorable than the results of our completed Phase 3 trial and further delay or complicate the approval process. The incurrence of additional costs may require us to raise additional capital, and any delay in obtaining approval of our product candidate will reduce the period during which we can market and sell our product with patent protection and may affect our ability to obtain other protections against competition.  
     
  Our cash flow from operations is not adequate and our future capital requirements will be substantial and may increase beyond our current expectations depending on many factors including, but not limited to: the number, duration and results of the clinical trials for our various  product candidates going forward; unexpected delays or developments in seeking regulatory approvals; the time and cost in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims; other unexpected developments encountered in implementing our business and commercialization strategies; the outcome of and expenses incurred during existing and any future litigation; and further arrangements, if any, with collaborators. We will rely, in part, on sales of AminoPure  for revenues, which we expect will increase due to the expected growth in its export volume as we have added additional distributors and expanded retail markets outside of the United States. Revenues from NutreStore  currently are not significant and we are unsure whether sales of NutreStore  will increase. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, future cash needs are expected to be financed through registered or unregistered equity offerings, debt financings, loans, including loans from related parties, or other sources, such as strategic partnership agreements and corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, there can be no assurance of the availability of such capital on terms acceptable to us (or at all). 
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and during the year ended December 31, 2015,  we borrowed $5.2 million and $7.3 million, respectively, pursuant to convertible notes and non-convertible promissory notes, of which $0.8 million and $2.2 million, respectively, have been issued to related parties. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate principal amounts outstanding under convertible notes and non-convertible promissory notes totaled $19.2 million and $19.1 million, respectively. The convertible notes and non-convertible promissory notes bear interest at rates ranging from 6% to 11% and are unsecured, except for a 2011 convertible note in the principal amount of $0.3 million and two of 2016 non-convertible promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1.3 million. The net proceeds of the loans were used for working capital, and general corporate purposes.

   Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015   
     
   Net cash used in operating activities   
     
  Net  cash flows used in operating activities increased by $14.4 million, or 263%, to $19.8 million from $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This increase was primarily due to a $5.5 million increase in net loss partially offset by a $13.1 million decrease of working capital, a $4.2 million increase in the non-cash adjustments to net loss. The increase in non-cash adjustments to net loss was primarily attributable to the following: $2.1 million for the change in the fair value of liability classified warrants and warrant derivative liabilities, $1.4 million for convertible note inducement expense, $0.8 million increase in interest expense accrued from discount of notes, $0.4 million for gain on derecognition of accounts payable and settlement of litigation, $0.4 million for a foreign exchange adjustment on notes payable and $0.3 million for loss on debt settlement for promissory note conversion into Company common stock, partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in share-based compensation and a $0.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense. 
     
   Net cash used in investing activities   
     
  Net  cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $2,000, or 52%, to $2,000 from $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities includes purchase of property and equipment. 
     
   Net cash from financing activities   
     
  Net  cash flows from financing activities increased by $20.5 million, or 380%, to $25.9 million from $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of an $22.1 million increase in proceeds of issuance of common stocks, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in proceeds from issuance of convertible and non-convertible promissory notes, a $0.9 million increase in repayment of convertible and non-convertible promissory notes and a $0.1 million decrease in proceeds from exercise of warrants. 
     
   Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements   
     
  We have no  off-balance sheet arrangements. 
     
   Critical Accounting Policies   
     
  M anagement s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern. Due to the uncertainty of the Company s ability to meet its current operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, as the continuation and expansion of its business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, successful and sufficient market acceptance of its products, and finally, achieving a profitable level of operations. The consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the present circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
     
  Refer to  Critical Accounting Policies  in Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of the Annual Report for our critical accounting policies. There have been no material changes in any of our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  D isclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

  As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation and due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. Our management is working at remediating the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. However, we have not yet completed a full annual accounting cycle since December 31, 2015 to fully validate the remediation of the material weakness in our internal controls and the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures.  
     
   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
     
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
     
   Material Weakness and Plan of Remediation   
     
  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Material weaknesses would permit information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits to not be recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  
     
  We conducted an evaluation pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. This evaluation was conducted under the supervision of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Business Officer, Sr. Vice President of Finance, and our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2015 principally due to the continuance of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, initially identified in our evaluations of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, with respect to the application of GAAP on certain complex transactions as well as maintaining effective controls over the completeness and accuracy of financial reporting for complex or unusual transactions. Further, as of mid-August 2015 through December 2015 we did not have a sufficient number of independent directors to constitute an audit committee.  
     
  Our management and Board of Directors are committed to the remediation of the material weakness, as well as the continued improvement of our overall system of internal control over financial reporting. We are in the process of implementing measures to remediate the underlying causes of the control deficiency that gave rise to the material weakness, which primarily include engaging additional and supplemental internal and external resources with the technical expertise in GAAP, as well as to implement new policies and procedures to provide more effective controls to track, process, analyze, and consolidate the financial data and reports.  
     
  We believe these measures will remediate the control deficiencies that gave rise to a material weakness. As we continue to evaluate and work to remediate these control deficiencies, we may determine that additional remedial measures are required.

   Part II. Other Information     
     
   Item 1. Legal Proceedings     
     
  Please refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on May 20, 2016 (the  Annual Report ), for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.

  Please refer to the risk factors disclosed in the  Risk Factors  section of the Annual Report.  
     
   Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds     
     
  On August 23, 2016, the Company issued a convertible note to a third party in the principal amount of $500,000, which note bears interest at 10% per annum and matures in six months with an option on the part of the holder to renew for up to two years. The principal amount plus any unpaid accrued interest due under the convertible note is convertible into shares of Company common stock at $3.50 per share.  
     
  In August and September 2016, the Company issued convertible notes to third parties totaling $1,221,600 in aggregate principal amount, which notes bear interest at 10% per annum starting from October 1, 2016 and mature on the respective one-year anniversary dates of the notes. If the Company completes the listing on the OTC market, the principal amount of the notes will automatically convert into shares of Company common stock at a fixed conversion price of $4.50 (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar transactions with respect to the capital stock of the Company). Within 30 days of such closing, all accrued and unpaid interest on the notes, if any, will be paid to the holder in cash. At or after the first anniversary of the loan date, the holders of the notes may convert some or all of the unpaid principal amount thereof, including unpaid accrued interest, into shares of Company common stock at a conversion price of $4.50 per share.  
     
  In connection with certain secured loans, on September 30, 2016 the Company issued the lender an additional warrant for the purchase of 18,750 shares of our common stock as these loans have been outstanding for more than 30 days during the 90-day period ending September 30, 2016 per the terms of the loans. These warrants may be exercised through a cashless exercise feature.  
     
  On August 26, 2016, the Company offered all of its note holders an opportunity to convert all or a portion of the principal amount of and accrued interest on their notes into shares of Company common stock at a price of $3.50 per share. Pursuant to the offer, 19 note holders elected to convert a total of $4,007,598 principal amount of and $260,124 of accrued interest on their notes into an aggregate of 1,219,350 shares of our common stock.  
     
  On September 27, 2016, a holder of options exercised its right to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock using a cashless exercise feature. As a result of this cashless exercise, we issued 14,000 shares of our common stock to the holder of these options and withheld issuing 36,000 shares of our common stock in satisfaction of the exercise price under the option.  
     
  All such securities noted above were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) or Regulation D under the Securities Act or, in the case of refinancings and conversions, upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. These securities qualified for exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D because the issuances did not involve a  public offering.  The issuances were not a public offering based upon the following factors: (i) a limited number of securities were issued to a limited number of investors; (ii) there was no public solicitation; (iii) each investor was an  accredited investor  as such term is defined by Rule 501 under the Securities Act; and (iv) the investment intent of the investors. No underwriters were used in connection with such sales of unregistered securities.

The Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as described herein.  
     
   1.               Amounts and Exercise Periods. 
     
  (a)           Holder may exercise this Warrant, in whole or in part, as to 650,000 Warrant Shares from January 1, 2018 to May 9, 2021 (the   2018 Warrant Shares  ). In no event may this Warrant with respect to the 2018 Warrant Shares be exercised after the date in this Section 1(a).  
     
  (b)           Holder may exercise this Warrant, in whole or in part, as to the remaining 650,000 Warrant Shares from January 1, 2019 to May 9, 2021 (the   2019 Warrant Shares  ). In no event may this Warrant with respect to the 2019 Warrant Shares be exercised after the date in this Section 1(b).  
     
   2.               Method of Exercise. 
     
  (a)           Subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of this Warrant and applicable securities laws, this Warrant may be exercised, from time to time in accordance with Section 1 hereof by the delivery (including, without limitation, delivery by facsimile) of the form of Notice of Exercise attached hereto as  Exhibit A  (the   Notice of Exercise  ), duly executed by the Holder, at the principal office of the Company, and as soon as practicable after such date, surrendering:  
     
  (i)            this Warrant at the principal office of the Company, and  
     
  (ii)           payment, (i) in cash (by check) or by wire transfer, (ii) by cancellation by the Holder of indebtedness of the Company to the Holder; or (iii) by a combination of (i) and (ii), of an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock being purchased upon such exercise by the then effective Exercise Price (the   Exercise Amount  ):  
     
 1   

(b)           Each exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the day on which this Warrant is surrendered to the Company as provided above. The person or persons entitled to receive the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of record of such Warrant Shares as of the close of business on the date the Holder is deemed to have exercised this Warrant.  
     
  (c)           As soon as practicable after the exercise of this Warrant, the Company at its expense will cause to be issued in the name of, and delivered to, the Holder, or as such Holder (upon payment by such Holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may direct:  
     
  (i)            a certificate or certificates for the number of Warrant Shares to which such Holder shall be entitled, and  
     
  (ii)           in case such exercise is in part only, a new warrant or warrants (dated the date hereof) of like tenor, calling in the aggregate on the face or faces thereof for the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of such Warrant Shares described in this Warrant minus the number of such Warrant Shares purchased by the Holder upon all exercises made in accordance with this Section 2.  
     
   3.               Representations and Warranties of the Company. 
     
  In connection with the transactions provided for herein, the Company hereby represents and warrants to the Holder that:  
     
  (a)            Organization, Good Standing, and Qualification.  The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify would have a material adverse effect on its business or properties.  
     
  (b)            Authorization.  Except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights, all corporate action has been taken on the part of the Company, its officers and directors necessary for the authorization, execution and delivery of this Warrant. The Company has taken all corporate action required to make all the obligations of the Company reflected in the provisions of this Warrant the valid and enforceable obligations they purport to be. The issuance of this Warrant will not be subject to preemptive rights of any stockholders of the Company. The Company has authorized sufficient shares of Common Stock to allow for the exercise of this Warrant.  
     
   4.               Representations and Warranties of the Holder. In connection with the transactions provided for herein, the Holder hereby represents and warrants to the Company that: 
     
  (a)            Authorization.  Holder represents that it has full power and authority to enter into this Warrant. This Warrant constitutes the Holder s valid and legally binding obligation, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights and (ii) laws relating to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.  
     
  (b)            Purchase Entirely for Own Account.  The Holder acknowledges that this Warrant is entered into by the Holder in reliance upon such Holder s representation to the Company that the Warrant and the Warrant Shares (collectively, the   Securities  ) will be acquired for investment for the Holder s own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof, and that the Holder has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in or otherwise distributing the same.  
     
 2   

By acknowledging this Warrant, the Holder further represents that the Holder does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement, or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such person or to any third person, with respect to the Securities.  
     
  (c)            Disclosure of Information.  The Holder acknowledges that it has received all the information it considers necessary or appropriate for deciding whether to acquire the Securities. The Holder further represents that it has had an opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the Company regarding the terms and conditions of the offering of the Securities.  
     
  (d)            Investment Experience.  The Holder is an investor in securities of companies in the development stage and acknowledges that it is able to fend for itself, can bear the economic risk of its investment, and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the Securities. If other than an individual, the Holder also represents it has not been organized solely for the purpose of acquiring the Securities.  
     
  (e)            Accredited Investor.  The Holder is an  accredited investor  within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D, as presently in effect, as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the   SEC  ) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the   Act  ).  
     
  (f)             Restricted Securities.  The Holder understands that the Securities are characterized as  restricted securities  under the federal securities laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from the Company in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations such securities may be resold without registration under the Act, only in certain limited circumstances. In this connection, Holder represents that it is familiar with Rule 144, as presently in effect, as promulgated by the SEC under the Act (  Rule 144  ), and understands the resale limitations imposed thereby and by the Act.  
     
  (g)            Further Limitations on Disposition.  The Holder, by acceptance hereof, agrees that, absent an effective registration statement filed with the SEC under the Act covering the disposition or sale of this Warrant or the Warrant Shares issued or issuable upon exercise hereof, as the case may be, and registration or qualification under applicable state securities laws, such Holder will not sell, transfer, pledge, or hypothecate any or all of this Warrant or such Warrant Shares, as the case may be, unless either (i) the Company has received an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such registration is not required in connection with such disposition or (ii) the sale of such Securities is made pursuant to SEC Rule 144.  
     
  (h)            Legends.  It is understood that the Securities may bear the following or a similar legend:  
     
   THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED, OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SUCH ACT OR UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER SUCH ACT.   
     
   5.               Valid Issuance; Taxes. All Warrant Shares issued upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and the Company shall pay all taxes and other governmental charges that may be imposed in respect of the issue or delivery thereof. The Company shall not be required to pay any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issuance of any certificate for Warrant Shares in any name other than that of the Holder of this Warrant, and in such case the Company 
     
 3   

shall not be required to issue or deliver any stock certificate or security until such tax or other charge has been paid, or it has been established to the Company s reasonable satisfaction that no tax or other charge is due.  
     
   6.               Adjustment of Exercise Price and Number and Kind of Warrant Shares. The number and kind of Warrant Shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: 
     
  (a)            Subdivisions, Combinations and Other Issuances.  If the Company shall at any time after the issuance but prior to the expiration of this Warrant subdivide its Common Stock, by split-up or otherwise, or combine its Common Stock, or issue additional shares of its Common Stock as a dividend with respect to any shares of its Common Stock, the Exercise Price shall be proportionally decreased and the number of Warrant Shares issuable on the exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately increased in the case of a subdivision or stock dividend. The Exercise Price shall be proportionally increased and the number of Warrant Shares issuable on the exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately decreased in the case of a combination. Any adjustment under this Section 5(a) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective, or as of the record date of such dividend, or in the event that no record date is fixed, upon the making of such dividend.  
     
  (b)            Reclassification, Reorganization and Consolidation.  In case of any reclassification, capital reorganization or change in the capital stock of the Company (other than as a result of a subdivision, combination or stock dividend provided for in Section 5(a) above), then, as a condition of such reclassification, reorganization or change, lawful provision shall be made, and duly executed documents evidencing the same from the Company or its successor shall be delivered to the Holder, so that the Holder shall have the right at any time prior to the expiration of this Warrant to purchase, at a total price equal to that payable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities or property receivable in connection with such reclassification, reorganization or change by a holder of the same number and type of securities as were purchasable as Warrant Shares by the Holder immediately prior to such reclassification, reorganization or change. In any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interest of the Holder so that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable with respect to any shares of stock or other securities or property deliverable upon exercise hereof, and appropriate adjustments shall be made to the per-share Exercise Price payable hereunder, provided the aggregate Exercise Price shall remain the same.  
     
  (c)            Notice of Adjustment.  When any adjustment is required to be made in the number or kind of Warrant Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Warrant, or in the Exercise Price, the Company shall promptly notify the Holder of such event and of the new Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares or other securities or property thereafter purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant.  
     
   7.               Termination of Warrant. 
     
  (a)             General . Subject to the first paragraph of this Warrant and Section 1, if the Holder s service to the Company shall terminate for any reason, including retirement, other than (i) Cause (as defined below), (ii) death or (iii) disability, this Warrant, to the extent that it is exercisable at the time of such termination, shall remain exercisable for the 90 day period following such termination, but in no event shall the Holder be permitted to purchase any of the 2018 Warrant Shares after May 9, 2021 or any of the 2019 Warrant Shares after May 9, 2021. This Warrant to the extent that it remains unexercisable as of the date of such a termination shall be terminated at the time of such termination. 
     
  (b)             Death or Disability . In the event that the Holder s service to the Company shall terminate on account of the death or disability of the Holder, Holder (or the Holder s legal representatives, heirs or legatees) shall be entitled to purchase those number of Warrant Shares that the Holder was entitled to purchase upon exercise of this Warrant prior to such termination of the Holder s service, for the one year period 
     
 4   

following such termination, but in no event shall the Holder (or the Holder s legal representatives, heirs or legatees) be permitted to purchase any of the 2018 Warrant Shares after May 9, 2021 or any of the 2019 Warrant Shares after May 9, 2021. The portion of this Warrant that remains unexercisable as of the date of a termination due to death or disability shall be terminated at the time of such termination.  
     
  (c)      Cause . If Holder is removed from service as a director of the Company by action of the Board of Directors or stockholders of the Company for Cause, this Warrant shall terminate at the commencement of business on the date of such removal. For purposes of this Warrant  Cause  shall mean (i) the Holder s willful and intentional repeated failure or refusal, continuing after notice that specifically identifies the breach(es) complained of, to perform substantially his material duties, responsibilities and obligations (other than a failure resulting from Holder s incapacity due to physical or mental illness or other reasons beyond the control of Holder), and which failure or refusal results in demonstrable direct and material injury to the Company; (ii) any willful and intentional act or failure to act involving fraud, misrepresentation, theft, embezzlement, dishonesty or moral turpitude (collectively,   Fraud  ), that results in demonstrable direct and material injury to the Company; and (iii) conviction of (or a plea of nolo contendere to) an offense that is a felony in the jurisdiction involved or which is a misdemeanor in the jurisdiction involved but which involves Fraud. For purposes of determining whether Cause exists, no act, or failure to act, on the Holder s part shall be deemed  willful  or  intentional  unless done, or omitted to be done, by such Holder in bad faith, and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. If, subsequent to the Holder s voluntary termination or involuntary termination without Cause, it is discovered that the Holder s service to the Company could have been terminated for Cause, the Company may deem such Holder s service to the Company to have been terminated for Cause. The Holder s termination for Cause shall be effective as of the date of the occurrence of the event giving rise to Cause, regardless of when the determination of Cause is made.  
     
   8.               No Fractional Shares or Scrip. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant, but in lieu of such fractional shares the Company shall make a cash payment therefor on the basis of the Exercise Price then in effect. 
     
   9.               No Stockholder Rights. Prior to exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall not be entitled to any rights of a stockholder with respect to the Warrant Shares, including (without limitation) the right to vote such Warrant Shares, receive dividends or other distributions thereon, exercise preemptive rights or be notified of stockholder meetings, and, except as otherwise provided in this Warrant, such Holder shall not be entitled to any stockholder notice or other communication concerning the business or affairs of the Company. 
     
   10.            No Right to Continued Service or Directorship. Nothing contained in this Warrant will confer upon the Holder any right to become or remain in the service of the Company or any subsidiary, nor limit or affect in any manner the right of the Company or any subsidiary to terminate the service of Holder. 
     
   11.            Restrictions on Transfer. As provided herein, this Warrant may be transferred only pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Act, or an exemption from such registration. Subject to such restrictions, the Company shall transfer this Warrant from time to time upon the books to be maintained by the Company for that purpose, upon surrender hereof for transfer, properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instructions for transfer and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Company, including, if required by the Company, an opinion of its counsel to the effect that such transfer is exempt from the registration requirements of the Act, to establish that such transfer is being made in accordance with the terms hereof, and a new Warrant shall be issued to the transferee and the surrendered Warrant shall be canceled by the Company. 
     
   12.            Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Warrant shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California as applied to agreements among California residents, made and to be performed entirely within the State of California, except for provisions that apply to the regulation of the Company as a Delaware corporation, in which case Delaware General Corporate Law shall 
     
 5   

apply. The Company and, by accepting this Warrant, the Holder, each irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California located in Los Angeles County and the United States District Court for the Central District of California for the purpose of any suit, action, proceeding or judgment relating to or arising out of this Warrant and the transactions contemplated hereby. Service of process in connection with any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on each party hereto anywhere in the world by the same methods as are specified for the giving of notices under this Warrant. The Company and, by accepting this Warrant, the Holder, each irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such suit, action or proceeding and to the laying of venue in such court. The Company and, by accepting this Warrant, the Holder, each irrevocably waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such courts and irrevocably waives any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  EACH OF THE COMPANY AND, BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, THE HOLDER HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO REQUEST A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS WARRANT AND REPRESENTS THAT COUNSEL HAS BEEN CONSULTED SPECIFICALLY AS TO THIS WAIVER.   
     
   13.            Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of this Warrant shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Company and the holders hereof and their respective successors and assigns. 
     
   14.            Titles and Subtitles. The titles and subtitles used in this Warrant are used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this Warrant. 
     
   15.            Notices.
