the registrant s most recently completed second fiscal quarter during the
fiscal year represented by this Annual Report, was $40,897,950.  This value was
computed by reference to the price at which the registrant s common stock was
last sold as of June 30, 2015, and excludes the market value of the registrant s

executive officers of the registrant and known holders of 10% or more of the
common stock of the registrant.  These determinations and the underlying assumptions
should not be deemed to constitute an admission that all directors and executive
officers of the registrant and known holders of 10% or more of the common stock
of the registrant are, in fact, affiliates of the registrant, or that there are
no other persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of our company.  Further

stock is included in Part III, Item 12 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Explanatory Note   

HPIL
Holding (the  Company ) is filing this Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A (the  Second
Amendment ) to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ) on August
30, 2016 (the  Original Filing ), as previously amended by Amendment No. 1 on
Form 10-K/A as filed with the Commission on October 5, 2016 (the  First
Amendment ), for the purpose of revising the cover page and Part II, Item 5,
Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities.  

The
Original Filing and First Amendment indicated that the Company is a voluntary
filer and has never been required to file reports under Section 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).  This
was based on the Company s lack of confirmation that a registration statement
filed by the Company under prior management had become effective.  Current
management was unable to confirm with the Company s prior management that it
had received an effective statement from the Commission with respect to the
registration statement.  Additionally, no electronic notice of effectiveness
was ever made available on the Commission s EDGAR system, so confirmation was
not readily ascertainable by review of the Company s filings on EDGAR.  Since
the Original Filing and First Amendment, the Company has discussed the status
of the subject registration statement with the Commission.  In those
discussions, the Commission telephonically confirmed that the subject
registration statement was declared effective.  Therefore, the Company wishes
to clarify that it is required to file reports under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act and is not operating as a voluntary filer and withdraws any
statement to the contrary.  

Based
on our misunderstanding, the Company filed several periodic reports with OTC
Markets, Inc. ( OTC ) in compliance with the OTC Pink Current Information Tier
Basic Disclosure Guidelines, instead of filing those periodic reports with the
Commission.  Since that time, we have filed with the Commission all required
reports and, as of the date of this Amendment, are current with our reporting
obligations under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.  

Except
as stated in this Explanatory Note, no other information contained in any Item
of the Original Filing or First Amendment is being amended, updated or
otherwise revised.  This Amendment speaks as of the filing date of the
Original Filing and, except for the filing of the First Amendment, does not
reflect any events that may have occurred subsequent to such date.  

PART II   

ITEM 5.   

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S
  COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY
  SECURITIES   

Market Information   

Before we effectuated the
merger on October 7, 2009 (as described herein in the Business Background
Section), we traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the name TNT Designs, Inc.
and trade symbol  TNTD .  After the merger and change in name and business the
Company traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the trade symbol  TRHG .  On
February 23, 2010, TRHG was delisted from the OTC Bulletin Board due to
non-timely filings of periodic reports and was subsequently quoted on the Pink
Sheets.  From the time of the Company name change on May 22, 2012 (as described
herein in the Business Background Section), until April 14, 2016, o  ur Common Stock traded on the OTCQB Market under the
symbol  HPIL.  On April 14, 2016,   to focus more on
the development of our business,   we decided to temporarily cease filing
of periodic reports with the   Securities and Exchange
Commission and transitioned to filing periodic reports through the OTC Disclosure   News Service pursuant to the Pink Basic
Disclosure Guidelines.  Therefore, even though we began filing periodic reports
with the Securities and Exchange Commission again, since April 14, 2016, we
have traded on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol  HPIL.   Because we have been operating under our new trade symbol
for a relatively short duration of time and have only commenced limited
operations of our new business and have generated limited revenue from the new
business, there has been limited market activity up to this point in time.  
  The following table sets forth, for the periods
indicated, the high and low bid information for our Common Stock as determined
from sporadic quotations on the OTC Markets.  The following quotations reflect
inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may
not represent actual transactions.  

Security Holders   

As of   August 30,
2016  , there were 47,308,000 common shares outstanding which were held by
  approximately   422   
stockholders of record.  

Dividends   

We have never declared or paid
any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash
dividends in the foreseeable future.  We currently intend to retain all of our
future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business.  

Transfer Agent   

Bay City Transfer Agency and
Registrar, Inc. is currently serving as our transfer agent.  

Common Stock   

We are authorized to issue
400,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001, of which   47,308,000    shares are issued
and outstanding as of August 30, 2016.  Each holder of our shares of our common
stock is entitled to one (1) vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by
the stockholders, including the election of directors.  The holders of shares
of common stock have no preemptive, conversion, subscription or cumulative
voting rights.  There is no provision in our Articles of Incorporation or
By-laws that would delay, defer or prevent a change in control of our Company.  

Preferred
Stock   

As of December 31, 2015, we were authorized to issue 100,000,000
shares of preferred stock. 25,000,000 shares of our preferred stock were
designated as Series 1, Class P-1 stock with a par value of $8.75 per share,
and the other 75,000,000 shares of preferred stock were designated as Series 1,
Class P-2 stock with a par value of $7.00 per share.  

2  

On April 19, 2016, we filed an
amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada to amend our Articles of
Incorporation, Article IV - Capital Stock, to cancel the Preferred Stock
effective as of April 18, 2016.  There were no shares of preferred stock (as
defined herein) issued and outstanding as of   December 31, 2015, nor as of the date of cancellation of the class,
April 18, 2016  .   

Recent Sales of
Unregistered Securities   

The Company did not sale or
issue any of its unregistered securities during the three months ended December 31, 2015.  However, during this same period, the
Company acquired shares of its common stock in two separate transactions.  

The Company divested its
remaining quotas (16 total) in HREM to Haesler in exchange for 175,000 shares
of the Company common stock pursuant to a Second Amendment Agreement dated
November 15, 2015 (see section (c) of Item 1, above, for a more detailed description
of this transaction).  Additionally, the Company sold the IFLOR Asset to GIOTOS
Limited in exchange for 10,040,000 shares of the Company common stock pursuant
to an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement dated December 9, 2015 (see section (c)
of Item 1, above, for a more detailed description of this transaction).

Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report
to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
