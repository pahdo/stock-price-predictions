NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited)  

1. 
    Basis of Presentation 
       
  The consolidated financial statements of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (we, us, our or the Company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended   February 27, 2016  . We use the same accounting policies in preparing quarterly and annual financial statements. All adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of quarterly operating results are reflected herein and are of a normal, recurring nature. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. The results of operations for the   six  -month period ended   August 27, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
    
  In connection with preparing the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the   six   months ended   August 27, 2016  , we evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the date of this filing and determined there were no items to recognize or disclose.   

2. 
    New Accounting Standards 
       
  In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  , which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. We early adopted this standard in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, and prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements in any period presented. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We will adopt this standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018 and do not expect it to have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements.           
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which provides for comprehensive changes to lease accounting. The new standard requires that a lessee recognize a lease obligation liability and a right to use asset for virtually all leases of property, plant and equipment, subsequently amortized over the lease term. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with a modified retrospective transition. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.           
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. Under the new standard, an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, Apogee's fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  

3. 
    Share-Based Compensation 
     Total share-based compensation expense included in the results of operations was   $2.9 million   and   $2.4 million   for the   six  -month periods ended   August 27, 2016   and   August 29, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Stock Options and SARs 
  There were no stock options or SARs issued in the first   six   months of either fiscal   2017   or   2016  . The following table summarizes activity for the   six   months ended   August 27, 2016  :    
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

Cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were   $1.3 million   and   $1.4 million   for the   six   months ended   August 27, 2016   and   August 29, 2015  , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of securities exercised (the amount by which the stock price on the date of exercise exceeded the stock price of the award on the date of grant) was   $4.5 million   during the   six   months ended   August 27, 2016   and   $6.6 million   during the prior-year period. 
    
  Nonvested Shares and Share Units 
  The following table summarizes nonvested share activity for the   six   months ended   August 27, 2016  :    

At   August 27, 2016  , there was   $9.7 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share and nonvested share unit awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   24   months. The total fair value of shares vested during the   six   months ended   August 27, 2016   was   $6.2 million  . 

4. 
    Earnings per Share 
       
  The following table presents a reconciliation of the share amounts used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

There were no anti-dilutive stock options excluded from the calculation of earnings per share for any of the periods presented, as the average market price exceeded the exercise price of options outstanding.

    Marketable Securities 
       
  We hold the following marketable securities, all classified as available for sale:    

We are invested in a mutual fund holding short-term government securities as a means of deploying excess cash generated from operations while preserving liquidity.     
    
  We have a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Prism Assurance, Ltd. (Prism), which holds municipal bonds. Prism insures a portion of our general liability, workers  compensation and automobile liability risks using reinsurance agreements to meet statutory requirements. The reinsurance carrier requires Prism to maintain fixed-maturity investments, which are generally high-quality municipal bonds, for the purpose of providing collateral for Prism s obligations under the reinsurance agreement. 
    
  As of   August 27, 2016  , marketable securities with a fair value of   $1.2 million     have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than 12 months with unrea  lized losses of   $0.1 million  . 
    
  We test for other-than-temporary losses on a quarterly basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an investment may not be recoverable. We consider the unrealized losses indicated above to be temporary in nature. We intend to hold our investments until the full principal amount can be recovered, and we have the ability to do so based on other sources of liquidity.  
    
  The amortized cost and estimated fair values of municipal bonds at   August 27, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities, as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalty.    

Gross realized gains and losses were   not significant   during the first   six   months of fiscal   2017   and fiscal   2016  . 

7. 
    Fair Value Measurements 
       
  Financial assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities); Level 2 (observable market inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data). We do not have any Level 3 assets or liabilities. 
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

Cash equivalents 
  Fair value of money market funds was determined based on quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. Commercial paper was measured at fair value using inputs based on quoted prices for similar securities in active markets.  
    
  Short- and long-term securities 
  Mutual funds were measured at fair value based on quoted prices for identical assets in active markets.  
    
  Municipal bonds were measured at fair value based on market prices from recent trades of similar securities and are classified as short-term or long-term based on maturity date. 

8. 
    Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets 
       
  The carrying amount of goodwill attributable to each reporting segment is as follows:

     Table of Contents  

The following table provides the gross carrying amount of other intangible assets and related accumulated amortization: 

Amortization expense on definite-lived intangible assets was   $0.8 million   and   $0.9 million   for the   six  -month periods ended   August 27, 2016   and   August 29, 2015  , respectively. The amortization expense associated with debt issue costs is included in interest expense while the remainder is in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated results of operations. At   August 27, 2016  , the estimated future amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets was: 

Debt at   August 27, 2016   consisted of   $20.4 million   of industrial revenue bonds that mature in fiscal years 2021 through 2043. The fair value of the industrial revenue bonds approximates carrying value at   August 27, 2016  , due to the variable interest rates on these instruments. The bonds would be classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy described in Note 7. 
    
  We maintain a   $125.0 million   committed revolving credit facility that expires in   December 2019  .   No   borrowings were outstanding under the facility as of   August 27, 2016   or   February 27, 2016  . As defined within our committed revolving credit facility, we are required to comply with two financial covenants. These financial covenants require us to stay below a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio and maintain a minimum net worth. At   August 27, 2016  , we were in compliance with both financial covenants. 
    
  We also maintain a $  4.0 million   Canadian dollar revolving demand facility available to our Canadian operation. No borrowings were outstanding under this facility as of   August 27, 2016   or   February 27, 2016  . Borrowings under the facility are made available at the sole discretion of the lender and are payable on demand, with interest at rates specified in the credit agreement.  
    
  Interest payments were   $0.3 million   for each of the   six   months ended   August 27, 2016   and   August 29, 2015  .

    Employee Benefit Plans 
       
  Pension Plans 
  The Company sponsors two defined-benefit pension plans: an unfunded Officers  Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the Tubelite Inc. Hourly Employees  Pension Plan. Components of net periodic benefit cost are: 

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions, Canada, Brazil and other international jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2013, or U.S. state and local income tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2009. The Company is not currently under U.S. federal examination for years subsequent to fiscal year 2012, and there is very limited audit activity of the Company s income tax returns in U.S. state jurisdictions or international jurisdictions. 
    
  The total liability for unrecognized tax benefits at   August 27, 2016   and   February 27, 2016   was approximately   $5.2 million   and   $5.0 million  , respectively. Penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense. The total liability for unrecognized tax benefits is expected to decrease by approximately   $0.6 million   during the next 12 months due to lapsing of statutes. 

12. 
    Other Non-Current Liabilities 

13. 
    Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
       
  Operating lease commitments.   As of   August 27, 2016  , the Company was obligated under non-cancelable operating leases for buildings and equipment. Certain leases provide for increased rental payments based upon increases in real estate taxes or operating costs. Future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases are:    

Bond commitments.   In the ordinary course of business, predominantly in our Architectural Services segment, we are required to provide surety or performance bonds that commit payments to our customers for any non-performance. At   August 27, 2016  ,   $125.4 million   of our backlog was bonded by performance bonds with a face value of   $322.9 million  . Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates, as we are released from the bonds upon completion of the contract. We have never been required to make any payments related to these performance bonds with respect to any of our current portfolio of businesses. 
    
  Warranties.   We accrue for warranty and claim costs as a percentage of sales based on historical trends and for specific sales credits as they become known and estimable. Actual warranty and claim costs are deducted from the accrual when paid. Factors that could have an impact on the warranty accrual in any given period include the following: changes in manufacturing quality, shifts in product mix and any significant changes in sales volume. A warranty rollforward is provided as follows:

     Table of Contents  

Letters of credit.   At   August 27, 2016  , we had ongoing letters of credit related to construction contracts and certain industrial revenue bonds. The total value of letters of credit under which we were obligated as of   August 27, 2016   was approximately   $23.5 million  , all of which have been issued under our committed revolving credit facility. Availability under this   $125.0 million   credit facility is reduced by borrowings under the facility and also by letters of credit issued under the facility. 
    
  Purchase obligations.   Purchase obligations for raw material commitments and capital expenditures totaled   $161.8 million   as of   August 27, 2016  . 
    
  New Markets Tax Credit transaction.   In June 2016, we entered into a transaction with a subsidiary of Wells Fargo (WF) under a qualified New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program related to an investment in plant and equipment within our Architectural Glass segment (the Project). The NMTC transaction is subject to 100 percent tax credit recapture for a period of seven years. Therefore, proceeds received in exchange for the transfer of the tax credits will be recognized as earnings in fiscal 2024, if the expected tax benefits are delivered without risk of recapture to WF and our performance obligation is relieved. 
    
  In exchange for substantially all of the benefits derived from the tax credits, WF contributed   $6.0 million   to the Project, which is included in other non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Direct and incremental costs incurred in structuring the arrangement have been deferred and will be recognized in proportion to the recognition of the related profits. These costs amounted to   $0.9 million   and are included in other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Variable-interest entities have been created as a result of the transaction structure, which have been included within our consolidated financial statements as WF does not have a material interest in the underlying economics of the Project.   
     Litigation.   We are a party to various legal proceedings incidental to our normal operating activities. In particular, like others in the construction supply and services industry, our businesses are routinely involved in various disputes and claims arising out of construction projects, sometimes involving significant monetary damages or product replacement. We are also subject to litigation arising out of general liability, employment practices, workers' compensation and automobile claims. Although it is very difficult to accurately predict the outcome of such proceedings, facts currently available indicate that no such claims will result in losses that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

14. 
    Segment Information 
       
  The Company has   four   reporting segments: Architectural Glass, Architectural Services, Architectural Framing Systems and Large-Scale Optical (LSO).  
             
    The Architectural Glass segment fabricates coated, high-performance glass used in customized window and wall systems comprising the outside skin of commercial, institutional and high-end multi-family residential buildings.  
                
    The Architectural Services segment designs, engineers, fabricates and installs the walls of glass, windows and other curtainwall products making up the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings. 
                
    The Architectural Framing Systems segment designs, engineers, fabricates and finishes the aluminum frames used in customized aluminum and glass window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems comprising the outside skin and entrances of commercial, institutional and high-end multi-family residential buildings. The Company has aggregated   four   operating segments into this reporting segment based on their similar products, customers, distribution methods, production processes and economic characteristics.  
                
    The LSO segment fabricates value-added glass and acrylic products for the picture framing, fine art, wall decor and display markets.

     Table of Contents  

Due to the varying combinations and integration of individual window, storefront and curtainwall systems, it is impractical to report product revenues generated by class of product, beyond the segment revenues currently reported. 

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Forward-Looking Statements 
  This discussion contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. The words  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intend,   estimate,   forecast,   project,   should  and similar expressions are intended to identify  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forecasts and projections in this document are  forward-looking statements,  and are based on management s current expectations or beliefs of the Company s near-term results, based on current information available pertaining to the Company, including the risk factors noted under Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 27, 2016  . From time to time, we may also provide oral and written forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public such as press releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, or other communications by the Company. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this report and in any public statements we make could be materially different from actual results. 
    
  Accordingly, we wish to caution investors that any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. These uncertainties and other risk factors include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties set forth under Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 27, 2016  . 
    
  We wish to caution investors that other factors might in the future prove to be important in affecting the Company s results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time; it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

  Net sales 
  Consolidated net sales increased   15.7 percent  , or $  37.7 million  , for the   second   quarter ended   August 27, 2016  , and 9.5 percent, or $45.6 million, for the six months ended August 27, 2016, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 in all three architectural segments was largely due to gains in volume, pricing and mix, driven by continued strength in non-residential construction end-markets as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. For the six-month period, sales growth was driven by a combination of project timing in the Architectural Services segment and volume growth in the Architectural Framing Systems segment. Foreign currency did not have a meaningful impact on sales results in either of the current year periods as compared to the prior year periods.  
    
  The relationship between various components of operations, as a percentage of net sales, is illustrated below:    

Gross profit 
  Gross profit as a percent of sales increased to   26.0   percent for the three- and six-month periods ended   August 27, 2016  , from   23.6 percent   and 23.4 percent in the three- and six-month periods, respectively, of the prior year. Gross profit improvements in both periods of fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 were driven by a combination of improved productivity and pricing and increased volume in our three Architectural-based segments.   
  Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses 
  SG A expenses for the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017 increased $5.2 million over the second quarter of last year, but were flat at   14.2 percent   of net sales in both quarterly periods. For the six-month period ended August 27, 2016, SG A expenses increased $6.0 million compared to the prior year six-month period, but declined to 14.8 percent of sales compared to 14.9 percent in the prior-year comparative period. The increased expense in both periods of fiscal 2017 compared to the prior-year periods was due to increased sales-related wages to drive growth and overall incentive compensation due to improved results.        
  Income tax expense 
  Our effective tax rate in the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017 was   32.9 percent  , compared to   34.2 percent   in the same period last year, and our effective tax rate for the six-month period ended August 27, 2016 was 33.1 percent, compared to 34.1 percent in the same period last year, mainly as a result of differences in the timing of the federal research and development tax credit.

Segment Analysis 
    
  Architectural Glass 

For the quarter, Architectural Glass net sales increased   $6.8 million  , or   7.3 percent  , over the second quarter of the prior year due to improved pricing and mix and volume growth in our domestic markets. For the six-month period of the current year, net sales declined   $1.0 million  , or   0.5 percent  , from the six-month period last year due to lower export and international sales offsetting improved domestic pricing and mix. Additionally, fiscal 2017 results in both periods were impacted by weaker performance in our Brazilian glass fabrication operation due to the ongoing challenging local economic conditions. Foreign currency impact on sales was nominal in both periods of fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. 
  Operating margin improved 240 basis points and 210 basis points for the three- and six-month periods of the current year, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, driven by improved productivity, pricing and mix and volume growth in the U.S., partially offset by the continued challenging Brazilian economic conditions.  
    
  Architectural Services 

Architectural Services net sales increased   $25.5 million  , or   48.9 percent  , and   $32.7 million  ,  or   30.3 percent  , for the three- and six-month periods ended August 27, 2016, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to year-on-year timing of project activity. 
  Operating margin improved 530 basis points and 450 basis points for the three- and six-month periods of the current year, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year, due to leveraging strong volume at better project margins with good project execution.  
    
  Architectural Framing Systems 

Architectural Framing Systems net sales increased   $11.6 million  , or   14.3 percent  , and   $20.8 million  , or   13.6 percent  , for the three- and six-month periods ended August 27, 2016, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to volume growth across all businesses, along with improved product mix.  
  Operating margin improved 210 basis points and 360 basis points for the three- and six-month periods of the current year, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year, due to improved operational performance, operating leverage on volume growth and lower material costs.

     Table of Contents  

Large-Scale Optical (LSO) 

LSO net sales declined   $1.2 million  , or   5.2 percent  , and   $1.4 million  , or   3.2 percent  , for the three- and six-month periods ended August 27, 2016, respectively, over the comparative prior-year periods, due to timing of customer orders.  
  Operating margin declined 140 basis points and 110 basis points for the three- and six-month periods of the current year, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year, due to lower volume and investments for growth in new geographies and product markets.    
    
  Backlog 
  Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the near term from firm contracts or orders. We use backlog as one of the metrics to evaluate near-term sales trends in our business. Backlog is not a term defined under GAAP and is not a measure of contract profitability. Backlog should not be used as the sole indicator of our future revenue and earnings.  
    
  We include a project within our backlog at the time a signed contract or a firm purchase order is received, generally as a result of a competitive bidding process. Backlog by reporting segment was: 

In general, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, an increased portion of our revenues from shorter lead-time work that turns quickly and books and ships within the same period. These book-and-ship sales are not included in our backlog within the period. Backlog at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017 declined from the prior periods as a result of inconsistent timing in committed Architectural Services segment projects. We expect approximately   $281 million  , or   63 percent  , of backlog at   August 27, 2016   to be recognized during the remainder of fiscal   2017  , and approximately   $167 million  , or   37 percent  , to be recognized in fiscal 2018.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Operating Activities.   Cash provided by operating activities was   $41.2 million   for the first   six   months of fiscal   2017  , decreasing $20.9 million over the prior year due to increased investment in working capital to support growth, partially offset by improved operating results.  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents  

Investing Activities.   In the first   six   months of fiscal   2017  , net cash used by investing activities was   $49.3 million  , compared to   $73.5 million   in the same period last year. Current year usage was mainly in the form of capital expenditures, while the prior year was driven by net purchases of short-term marketable securities of $53.2 million. In relation to our New Markets Tax Credit transaction, we also restricted $16.9 million of cash during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 for investment in our oversized glass fabrication project in our Architectural Glass segment to take place over the next 12 months (additional discussion in Note 13). 
    
  We expect fiscal   2017   capital expenditures of approximately $70 million, primarily to increase our product capabilities. In particular, we are investing in the oversized glass fabrication project, and to increase our manufacturing productivity across our reporting segments. 
    
  We continue to review our portfolio of businesses and their assets in comparison to our internal strategic and performance objectives. As part of this review, we may acquire other businesses, pursue geographic expansion, take actions to manage capacity and/or further invest in, fully divest and/or sell parts of our current businesses. 
    
  Financing Activities.   We paid dividends totaling   $7.1 million   ($0.25 per share) in the first six months of fiscal 2017. We maintain a $  125.0 million   committed revolving credit facility as described in Note 9. As defined within our committed revolving credit facility, we are required to comply with two financial covenants. These financial covenants require us to stay below a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio and maintain a minimum net worth. At   August 27, 2016  , we were in compliance with both financial covenants. 
    
  Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program. We did not repurchase any shares under the program during the first   six   months of either fiscal   2017   or fiscal 2016. We have repurchased a total of   3,057,632   shares, at a total cost of   $61.5 million  , since the inception of this program during fiscal 2004. We have remaining authority to repurchase   1,192,368   shares under this program, which has no expiration date. 
    
  Other Financing Activities.   The following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity as of   August 27, 2016  : 

From time to time, we acquire the use of certain assets through operating leases, such as warehouses, vehicles, forklifts, office equipment, hardware, software and some manufacturing equipment. Many of these operating leases have termination penalties. However, because the assets are used in the conduct of our business operations, it is unlikely that any significant portion of these operating leases would be terminated prior to the normal expiration of their lease terms. Therefore, we consider the risk related to termination penalties to be minimal. 
    
  Purchase obligations in the table above relate to raw material commitments and capital expenditures. 
    
  We expect to make contributions of   $1.0 million   to our defined-benefit pension plans in fiscal   2017  , which will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements. 
    
  As of   August 27, 2016  , we had reserves of   $5.2 million   and   $1.5 million   for unrecognized tax benefits and environmental liabilities, respectively. We expect approximately   $0.6 million   of the unrecognized tax benefits to lapse during the next 12 months. We are unable to reasonably estimate in which future periods the remaining unrecognized tax benefits and environmental liabilities will ultimately be settled. 
    
  At   August 27, 2016  , we had ongoing letters of credit related to industrial revenue bonds and construction contracts that reduce availability of funds under our committed credit facility.  The letters of credit by expiration period are: 
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

In addition to the above standby letters of credit, we are required, in the ordinary course of business, to provide surety or performance bonds that commit payments to our customers for any non-performance by us. At   August 27, 2016  ,   $125.4 million   of our backlog was bonded by performance bonds with a face value of   $322.9 million  . Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates, as we are released from the bonds upon completion of the contract. We have never been required to make any payments related to these performance bonds with respect to any of our current portfolio of businesses. 
    
  At   August 27, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents, short-term securities and restricted cash of   $94.6 million  , and   $101.5 million   available under our committed revolving credit facility. We believe that our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures and dividend payments for the next 12 months.

  The following statements are based on our current expectations for full-year fiscal   2017   results. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
              a) 
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
              b) 
    Changes in internal controls: There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   August 27, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
       
  The Company has been a party to various legal proceedings incidental to its normal operating activities. In particular, like others in the construction supply and services industry, the Company s construction supply and services businesses are routinely involved in various disputes and claims arising out of construction projects, sometimes involving significant monetary damages or product replacement. The Company is also subject to litigation arising out of employment practices, workers compensation, general liability and automobile claims. Although it is very difficult to accurately predict the outcome of such proceedings, facts currently available indicate that no such claims will result in losses that would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Company. 

Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
       
  There have been no material changes or additions to our risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 27, 2016  .
