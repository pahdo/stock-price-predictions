    Organization 
     Zoetis Inc. (including its subsidiaries, collectively, Zoetis, the company, we, us or our) is a global leader in the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines and vaccines, with a focus on both livestock and companion animals. We organize and operate our business in   two   geographic regions: the United States (U.S.) and International.  
  We directly market our products in approximately   45   countries across North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and South America. Our products are sold in more than   100   countries, including developed markets and emerging markets. We have a diversified business, marketing products across   eight   core species: cattle, swine, poultry, sheep and fish (collectively, livestock) and dogs, cats and horses (collectively, companion animals); and within   five   major product categories: anti-infectives, vaccines, parasiticides, medicated feed additives and other pharmaceuticals.  
   
           2. 
    Basis of Presentation 
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) can be condensed or omitted. Balance sheet amounts and operating results for subsidiaries operating outside the United States are as of and for the three and nine-month periods ended   August 28, 2016  , and   August 23, 2015  .  
  We follow a 13-week quarterly accounting cycle pursuant to which the first three quarters end on a Sunday and the fiscal year always ends on December 31 for our operations in the United States and on November 30 for subsidiaries operating outside the United States. As a result of this convention, the first quarter of fiscal 2016 had six additional days and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 will have five less days compared with the respective quarters of fiscal 2015.  
  Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these interim financial statements may not be representative of those for the full year.  
  We are responsible for the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. The condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that are considered necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position and operating results. The information included in this interim report should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year data to conform to current year presentation. 
   
           3. 
    Significant Accounting Policies  
     New Accounting Standards 
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update that will require the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs as opposed to when the asset is sold to an outside third party. The provisions of the new standard are effective beginning January 1, 2018, for annual and interim reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted beginning on January 1, 2017. The new standard requires a modified retrospective adoption approach, as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are continuing to assess the potential impact that adopting this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payments. The new standard requires the immediate recognition of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the income statement, and requires classification of excess tax benefits as an operating activity as opposed to a financing activity in the statements of cash flows. The standard also clarifies that all cash payments made to taxing authorities on the employees' behalf for shares withheld should be presented as financing activities on the statements of cash flows and provides for a policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. The provisions of the new standard are effective beginning January 1, 2017, and early adoption is permitted if all amendments are adopted in the same period. We elected to early adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2016. Excess tax benefits of   $7 million   generated during the first nine months of 2016 are reflected as a component of   Provision for taxes on income   as presented in the condensed consolidated statements of income. We have elected to apply the change in cash flow classification for excess tax benefits on a prospective basis. Cash payments made to taxing authorities on the behalf of company employees are reflected as a financing outflow in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with prior years. We continue to include the impact of estimated forfeitures when determining share-based compensation expense. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet with a corresponding right of use asset. Leases will be classified as financing or operating which will drive the expense recognition pattern. For lessees, the income statement presentation and expense recognition pattern for financing and operating leases is similar to the current model for capital  
  
   6   | 

     Table of Contents  

and operating leases, respectively. Accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged. Companies may elect to exclude short-term leases. The update also requires additional disclosures that will better enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The provisions of the new standard are effective beginning January 1, 2019, for annual and interim reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted beginning on January 1, 2017. The new standard requires a modified retrospective adoption approach, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We continue to assess the potential impact that adopting this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to simplify the measurement of inventory by requiring that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, rather than at the lower of cost or market, with market being defined as either replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin. The provisions of the new standard are effective beginning January 1, 2017, for annual and interim reporting periods. The guidance will be adopted prospectively and early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2017, the required effective date, and do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that provides revised guidance on whether to consolidate certain legal entities, such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations and securitization structures. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016. This guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that outlines a new, single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. This update supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance includes a five-step model for determining how, when and how much revenue should be recognized. This update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We plan to adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2018, the required effective date. The new standard allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective transition upon adoption. We continue to assess the transition method we will elect for adoption as well as the potential impact that adopting this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

    Acquisitions and Divestitures 
     A.  Acquisitions 
  Acquisition of Pharmaq  
  On November 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Pharmaq, a privately held Norwegian aquaculture company. We acquired   100%   of the issued share capital of Pharmaq for an aggregate cash purchase price of   $765 million  , adjusted to reflect cash, working capital and net indebtedness as of the closing date for net cash consideration transferred to the seller of   $668 million  . The acquisition expands the Zoetis aquaculture portfolio. 
  The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, with the assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at their respective acquisition date fair values as summarized below:

(a)   
    Accounts receivable were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are substantially comprised of gross trade receivables of   $21 million  ,   $1 million   of which is expected to be uncollectible. 
               (b)   
    Inventories recorded as of the acquisition date reflect fair value adjustments of   $17 million   which relates primarily to finished goods. The fair value was calculated based on estimated selling profit margin.

     Table of Contents  

(c)   
    The acquisition date fair value of intangible assets acquired was determined using the income approach and consists of the following:   $160 million   related to currently marketed vaccine products,   $30 million   related to currently marketed therapeutics,   $80 million   related to customer relationships and   $280 million   related to in-process research and development (IPR D). The most significant IPR D project acquired, with an acquisition date fair value of   $150 million  , relates to the salmon rickettsial syndrome (SRS) vaccine. The vaccine was commercially launched, subsequent to the acquisition, during November 2015. Other significant acquired IPR D projects relate to a vaccine for pancreatic disease,  PD  and Alphaflux, a therapeutic drug for the treatment of sea lice and vaccine technology for new species including Tilapia and Pangasius, were assigned acquisition date fair values of   $50 million  ,   $40 million  , and   $40 million  , respectively. Vaccine developed technology and customer relationships will be amortized over a   15   year useful life while therapeutic developed technology will be amortized over   10   years.  
               (d)   
    Pharmaq callable bonds and derivative contracts were recorded at acquisition date fair value and settled immediately following the closing.  
               (e)   
    The Pharmaq acquisition was structured as a stock purchase therefore we assumed the historical tax bases of its assets and liabilities. We also established net deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the fair value adjustments recorded as part of the opening balance sheet. The components of the Pharmaq net deferred tax liability are included within amounts reported in   Note 7. Income Taxes  . 
               (f)   
    Goodwill of   $302 million   is the excess of consideration transferred over the value of net assets acquired and was allocated to our existing reportable segments and is primarily attributable to corporate synergies related to platform functions. The primary strategic purpose of the acquisition was to enhance the company s existing product portfolio by enabling Zoetis to further expand into aquaculture. The goodwill recorded is not deductible for tax purposes. 
     All amounts recorded are subject to final valuation; however, any difference between such amounts and the final fair value determination for net assets acquired is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Any adjustments to our preliminary purchase price allocation identified during the measurement period, which will not exceed   one   year from the acquisition date, will be accounted for prospectively. 
  Acquisition of Abbott Animal Health 
  On February 10, 2015, we completed the purchase of certain assets of Abbott Animal Health (AAH), a subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AAH is a companion animal health business focused on the veterinary surgical suite. The purchase expands our companion animal product portfolio to include veterinarian solutions for anesthesia, pain management, and diabetes monitoring. 
  The   $254 million   purchase price included net cash of   $229 million   and an additional contingent payment of   $25 million   (acquisition date fair value of   $22 million  ) which was due to Abbott within one year of the acquisition date, subject to certain deductions in the event of sales disruptions due to supply issues. The   $25 million   payment was made to Abbott in February 2016. 
  The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, with the net assets acquired measured at their respective acquisition date fair values. Final amounts recorded for the acquisition include   $12 million   of inventory,   $8 million   of IPR D associated with oncology and osteoarthritis projects,   $5 million   of trade names related to diabetes and pain management products,   $16 million   of developed technology assets associated with pain management and surgical products,   $23 million   of other intangible assets including a favorable supply agreement and product exclusivity rights and property, plant and equipment of less than   $1 million  . Trade names and developed technology assets will be amortized over   15   years while other intangible assets acquired have a weighted average useful life of   5   years.  
  Goodwill of   $187 million   is the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of assets acquired and was allocated to our reportable segments and is predominantly attributable to synergies expected to be realized through the integration of AAH operations into the existing Zoetis business. The goodwill recorded is deductible for tax purposes. 
  The valuation was finalized during the first quarter of 2016. Final amounts noted above reflect a net increase of   $14 million   in intangible assets from the preliminary valuation, offset by a decrease in goodwill and inventory fair value adjustments. 
  B.  Divestitures 
  On April 28, 2016, we completed the sale of our   55 percent   ownership share of a Taiwan joint venture, including a manufacturing site in Hsinchu, Taiwan to Yung Shin Pharmaceutical Industrial Co., Ltd., a pharmaceutical company with an animal health business and headquarters in Taiwan. The sale also included a portfolio of products in conjunction with our comprehensive operational efficiency program. These products include medicated feed additives, anti-infective medicines and nutritional premixes for livestock, sold primarily in Taiwan and in international markets. We received   $13 million   in cash upon closing. The assets and liabilities related to this sale had been previously included within held for sale classification as of December 31, 2015. 
  On February 17, 2016, we completed the sale of our manufacturing site in Haridwar, India to the India-based pharmaceutical company Zydus Cadila (Cadila Healthcare Ltd.). The agreement also included the sale of a portfolio of our products in conjunction with our comprehensive operational efficiency program.

  On February 12, 2016, we completed the sale of   two   of our manufacturing sites in the United States: Laurinburg, North Carolina, and Longmont, Colorado, to Huvepharma NV (Huvepharma), a European animal health company. Huvepharma also assumed the assets and operations and the lease of our manufacturing and distribution site in Van Buren, Arkansas. The agreement included the sale of a portfolio of products in conjunction with our comprehensive operational efficiency program. These products included medicated feed additives, water soluble therapeutics and nutritionals for livestock sold in the U.S. and international markets. The related assets had been previously included within held for sale classification as of December 31, 2015.  
  During the first nine months of 2016, we received total cash proceeds of approximately   $88 million   related to the divestitures of our share of our Taiwan joint venture and the India and U.S. manufacturing sites noted above. During the first quarter of 2016, we recognized a net pre-tax gain of approximately   $33 million  , partially offset by a net pre-tax loss of approximately   $6 million   recognized during the second quarter of 2016. Gains and losses related to divestitures are recorded within   Other (income)/deductions  net  .

    Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives   
     In connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges associated with site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems. In connection with our acquisition activity, we typically incur costs and charges associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations, which may include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes, product transfers and restructuring the consolidated company, which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the consolidated company. All operating functions can be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development (R D), as well as functions such as business technology, shared services and corporate operations.  
  The components of costs incurred in connection with restructuring initiatives, acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives are as follows:    

            (a)   
    Integration costs represent external, incremental costs directly related to integrating acquired businesses and primarily include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes, as well as product transfer costs.  
               (b)   
    The restructuring charges/(benefits) for the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , and   September 27, 2015  , primarily relate to our operational efficiency initiative and supply network strategy.  
     The restructuring charges/(benefits) for the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , are associated with the following: U.S. (  $0 million   and   $2 million   benefit, respectively), International (  $1 million   benefit and   $16 million   benefit, respectively) and Manufacturing/research/corporate (  $5 million   and   $1 million  , respectively).  
  The restructuring charges for the three and   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , are associated with the following: U.S. (  $3 million   benefit and   $27 million  , respectively), International (  $2 million   and   $117 million  , respectively) and Manufacturing/research/corporate (  $9 million   and   $127 million  , respectively).  
  During 2015, we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program, which was incremental to the previously announced supply network strategy. These initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios through the elimination of approximately   5,000   product stock keeping units (SKUs), changing our selling approach in certain markets, reducing our presence in certain countries, and planning to sell or exit   ten   manufacturing sites over the long term. As of   October 2, 2016  , we divested   three   U.S. manufacturing sites,   one   international manufacturing site, and our   55 percent   ownership share of a Taiwan joint venture, inclusive of its related manufacturing site, and exited   one   international manufacturing site. See   Note 4B. Acquisitions and Divestitures: Divestitures   for additional information. We are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with non-customer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes. As part of these initiatives, we expect to reduce certain positions through divestitures, normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately   2,000   to   2,500  , subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries. As of   October 2, 2016  , approximately   1,800   positions have been eliminated and additional reductions are expected primarily over the next nine months.

Restructuring charges/(benefits) related to these initiatives are as follows: 

(a)      
    For the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , includes a reduction in employee termination accruals primarily as a result of higher than expected voluntary attrition rates experienced in the first half of 2016. 
               (b)   
    For the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , represents the net gain on the sale of certain manufacturing sites and products, partially offset by the loss on the sale of our share of our Taiwan joint venture, as part of our operational efficiency initiative.  
     The components of, and changes in, our restructuring accruals are as follows:  

(b)   
    Includes adjustments for foreign currency translation.

6. 
    Other (Income)/Deductions Net  
     The components of   Other (income)/deductions net   are as follows:  

(a)   
    For the three and   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , represents an impairment of finite-lived trademarks related to a canine pain management product. For the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , represents an impairment of IPR D assets related to the termination of a canine oncology project.  
               (b)   
    For the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , represents the net gain on the sale of certain manufacturing sites and products, partially offset by the loss on the sale of our share of a Taiwan joint venture, as part of our operational efficiency initiative.  
               (c)   
    Primarily driven by costs related to hedging and exposures to certain emerging market currencies.  
               (d)   
    For the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , primarily represents income associated with certain state business employment tax incentive credits. For the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , primarily represents inventory losses of   $3 million   sustained as a result of weather damage at storage facilities in Brazil and Australia, partially offset by interest income and other miscellaneous income.  
      
           7. 
    Income Taxes  
              A. 
    Taxes on Income 
     The effective tax rate was   28.8%   for the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with   30.4%   for the   three months ended September 27, 2015  . The lower effective tax rate for the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , was primarily attributable to:  
             
    a   $7 million   discrete tax benefit related to a revaluation of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities using the tax rates expected to be in place going forward as a result of the implementation of operational changes; and  
                
    the impact of the extent and location of restructuring charges related to the operational efficiency initiative, supply network strategy, asset impairments and gains and losses on asset divestitures, 
     partially offset by: 
             
    changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings from operations and repatriation costs. The jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary as a result of repatriation decisions and operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible items. 
     The effective tax rate was   33.3%   for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with   33.0%   for the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  . The higher effective tax rate for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , was primarily attributable to: 
             
    changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings from operations and repatriation costs. The jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary as a result of repatriation decisions and operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible items;  
                
    a   $38 million   net discrete tax expense recorded in the first half of 2016, related to changes in uncertain tax positions due to the impact of the European Commission s negative decision on the excess profits rulings in Belgium (see   C. Tax Contingencies  ), partially offset by a revaluation of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities using the tax rates expected to be in place going forward as a result of the decision; and 
                
    a valuation allowance of   $3 million   recorded in the second quarter of 2015, 
     partially offset by: 
             
    a   $7 million   discrete tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2016, related to a revaluation of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities using the tax rates expected to be in place going forward as a result of the implementation of operational changes; 
                
    a   $10 million   and   $9 million   discrete tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to a revaluation of deferred taxes as a result of a change in statutory tax rates;  
                
    a   $7 million   discrete tax benefit related to the adoption of a new accounting standard in 2016 requiring the excess tax benefits for share-based payments to be recognized as a component of   Provision for taxes on income  . See   Note 3. Significant Accounting Policies  ; 
                
    the impact of the extent and location of restructuring charges related to the operational efficiency initiative, supply network strategy, asset impairments and gains and losses on asset divestitures; and 
                
    a   $6 million   discrete tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2015 related to prior period tax adjustments.

B. 
    Deferred Taxes 
     As of   October 2, 2016  , the total net deferred income tax liability of $  147 million   is included in   Noncurrent deferred tax assets   ($  119 million  ) and   Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities   ($  266 million  ).  
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the total net deferred income tax liability of $  182 million   is included in   Noncurrent deferred tax assets   ($  82 million  ) and   Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities   ($  264 million  ).   
           C. 
    Tax Contingencies 
     As of   October 2, 2016  , the tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions of   $87 million   (exclusive of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $  10 million  ) are included in   Noncurrent deferred tax assets   ($  5 million  ) and   Other taxes payable   ($  82 million  ).  
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions of   $61 million   (exclusive of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $  7 million  ) are included in   Noncurrent deferred tax assets   ($  6 million  ) and   Other taxes payable   ($  55 million  ).  
  The increase in tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as of   October 2, 2016  , is primarily due to a net tax charge of approximately   $22 million  . The components of this net charge is a tax liability of   $50 million   related to the impact of the European Commission s negative decision on January 11, 2016, regarding the excess profits rulings in Belgium, reduced by a cash settlement of   $28 million   for the 2013-2014 periods. This charge does not include any benefits associated with a successful appeal of the decision. 
  Aside from the above, our tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations. Any settlements or statute of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. Substantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.  
  We believe that it is reasonably possible that our reserves for uncertain tax positions could decrease within the next twelve months by approximately   $22 million   due to the expected remaining payment due related to the impact of the European Commission s negative decision on the excess profits rulings in Belgium. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of uncertain tax positions and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and any variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant. 
   
           8. 
    Financial Instruments 
              A. 
    Debt 
     Credit Facilities 
  In   December 2012  , we entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a   five  -year   $1.0 billion   senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility), which became effective in February 2013 upon the completion of the initial public offering and expires in December 2017. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to   $1.5 billion  . The credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for such period) of   3.50:1  . Upon entering into a material acquisition, the maximum total leverage ratio increases to   4.25:1  , and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition. On November 10, 2015, we designated the acquisition of Pharmaq a material acquisition under the revolving credit agreement. For additional information, see   Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures  . On February 19, 2016, we amended this financial covenant to add back to Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA, any operational efficiency restructuring charge (defined as charges recorded by the company during the second quarter of 2015, related to our operational efficiency program announced on May 5, 2015, in an aggregate amount for all such charges not to exceed   $237 million  ) and Venezuela-related charges (defined as the write-down, impairment and other charges recorded by the company during the fourth quarter of 2015 relating to Venezuela, in an aggregate amount for all such charges not to exceed   $95 million  ). 
  The credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (the ratio of EBITDA at the end of the period to interest expense for such period) of   3.50:1  . In addition, the credit facility contains other customary covenants.  
  We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of   October 2, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . There were   no   amounts drawn under the credit facility as of   October 2, 2016  , or   December 31, 2015  . 
  We have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding short-term borrowings. As of   October 2, 2016  , we had access to   $81 million   of lines of credit which expire at various times through 2017 and are renewed annually. We did not have any borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of   October 2, 2016  . Short-term borrowings outstanding related to these facilities were   $4 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  
  Commercial Paper Program 
  In   February 2013  , we entered into a commercial paper program with a capacity of up to   $1.0 billion  . As of   October 2, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , there was   no   commercial paper issued under this program.

     Table of Contents  

Short-Term Borrowings 
  As of   October 2, 2016  , we did not have any short-term borrowings outstanding. As of   December 31, 2015  , short-term borrowings outstanding, including lines of credit, were $  5 million  , with a weighted-average interest rate of   5.2%  .  
  Senior Notes and Other Long-Term Debt 
  On November 13, 2015, we issued   $1.25 billion   aggregate principal amount of our senior notes (2015 senior notes), with an original issue discount of   $2 million  . On January 28, 2013, we issued   $3.65 billion   aggregate principal amount of our senior notes (the 2013 senior notes offering) in a private placement, with an original issue discount of   $10 million  .  
  There was   no   current portion of long-term debt as of   October 2, 2016  . The current portion of long-term debt was   $400 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , with a weighted-average interest rate of   1.150%  .  
  The 2013 and 2015 senior notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indenture (collectively, the indenture) between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee. The indenture contains certain covenants, including limitations on our, and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur liens or engage in sale-leaseback transactions. The indenture also contains restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets. In addition, the indenture contains other customary terms, including certain events of default, upon the occurrence of which the 2013 and 2015 senior notes may be declared immediately due and payable. 
  Pursuant to the indenture, we are able to redeem the 2013 and 2015 senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time by paying a  make whole  premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Pursuant to our tax matters agreement with Pfizer, we will not be permitted to redeem the 2013 senior notes due 2023 pursuant to this optional redemption provision, except under limited circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade of the 2013 and 2015 senior notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard   Poor's Ratings Services, we are, in certain circumstances, required to make an offer to repurchase all of the outstanding 2013 and 2015 senior notes at a price equal to   101%   of the aggregate principal amount of the 2013 and 2015 senior notes together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. 
  The components of our long-term debt are as follows: 

The fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, was   $4,760 million   and   $4,759 million   as of   October 2, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and has been determined using a third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data and Zoetis  credit rating (Level 2 inputs).  
  The principal amount of long-term debt outstanding, as of   October 2, 2016  , matures in the following years: 

Interest Expense 
  Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, was $  41 million   and   $125 million   for the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , respectively, and   $29 million   and   $86 million   for the three and   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , respectively. Capitalized interest was   $1 million   and $  2 million   for the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , and   $1 million   and   $3 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 27, 2015  , respectively. 
           B. 
    Derivative Financial Instruments 
     Foreign Exchange Risk 
  A significant portion of our revenue, earnings and net investment in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenue in relation to same- 
  
   13   | 

     Table of Contents  

currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. Depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments serve to protect net income against the impact of the translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions. The aggregate notional amount of foreign exchange derivative financial instruments offsetting foreign currency exposures was   $1.2 billion   and   $1.4 billion  , as of   October 2, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The derivative financial instruments primarily offset exposures in the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, euro, Japanese Yen, and U.K. pound. The vast majority of the foreign exchange derivative financial instruments mature within   60   days and all mature within   180   days. 
  All derivative contracts used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and are reported as assets or liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The company has not designated the foreign currency forward-exchange contracts as hedging instruments. We recognize the gains and losses on forward-exchange contracts that are used to offset the same foreign currency assets or liabilities immediately into earnings along with the earnings impact of the items they generally offset. These contracts essentially take the opposite currency position of that reflected in the month-end balance sheet to counterbalance the effect of any currency movement.  
  Interest Rate Risk 
  The company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rates and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. In anticipation of issuing fixed-rate debt, we may use forward-starting interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge against changes in interest rates that could impact expected future issuances of debt. To the extent these hedges of cash flows related to anticipated debt are effective, any unrealized gains or losses on the forward-starting interest rate swaps are reported in   Accumulated other comprehensive loss   and are recognized in income over the life of the future fixed-rate notes. When the company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that an anticipated transaction will occur within the originally expected period of execution, or within an additional two-month period thereafter, changes to fair value accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognized immediately in earnings. 
  In the first nine months of 2016, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of   $250 million  , having a term of   ten   years and an effective date and mandatory termination date of December 2017. We designated these swaps as cash flow hedges against interest rate exposure related principally to the anticipated future issuance of fixed-rate debt to be used primarily to refinance our   1.875%   2013 senior note due in 2018.

(a)         Primarily includes a   $16 million   purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition of a veterinary diagnostics business in Denmark and a   $12 million   purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition of a livestock business in South America, offset by a   $13 million   reduction in the acquisition date fair value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of certain assets of Abbott Animal Health. See   Note 4A. Acquisitions and Divestitures: Acquisitions.  
   (b)         Includes adjustments for foreign currency translation.  
  The gross goodwill balance was   $2,033 million   and   $1,991 million   as of   October 2, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Accumulated goodwill impairment losses were   $536 million   as of   October 2, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .

    Other Intangible Assets    
     The components of identifiable intangible assets are as follows:  

(a)   
    Includes the acquisition of intangible assets associated with the purchase of a veterinary diagnostics business in Denmark in the third quarter of 2016, the acquisition of intangible assets associated with the purchase of a livestock business in South America in the first quarter of 2016 and an increase in the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of certain assets of Abbott Animal Health, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. See   Note 4A. Acquisitions and Divestitures: Acquisitions.  
               (b)   
    Includes the acquisition of intangible assets associated with the purchase of a veterinary diagnostics business in Denmark in the third quarter of 2016. 
              C. 
    Amortization    
     Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in   Amortization of intangible assets   as it benefits multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in   Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses   or   Research and development expenses  , as appropriate. Total amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was   $24 million   and   $72 million   for the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , respectively, and   $16 million   and   $47 million   for the three and   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , respectively. 
   
   Our employees ceased to participate in the Pfizer, Inc. U.S. qualified defined benefit plans and the U.S. retiree medical plan effective December 31, 2012, and liabilities associated with our employees under these plans were retained by Pfizer. Pfizer is continuing to credit certain employees' service with Zoetis generally through December 31, 2017 (or termination of employment from Zoetis, if earlier) for certain early retirement benefits with respect to Pfizer's U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans. Pension and postretirement benefit expense associated with the extended service for certain employees in the U.S. plans totaled approximately   $2 million   in each   three month period ended     October 2, 2016  , and   September 27, 2015  , and   $5 million   in each nine month period ended   October 2, 2016  , and   September 27, 2015  .  
  The following table provides the net periodic benefit cost associated with our international defined benefit pension plans:  

Total company contributions to the international pension plans were   $1 million   and   $7 million   for the three and   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , and   $3 million   and   $6 million   for the three and   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , respectively. We expect to contribute a total of approximately   $9 million   to these plans in 2016.

    Share-Based Payments 
     The company may grant a variety of share-based payments under the Zoetis 2013 Equity and Incentive Plan (the Equity Plan) to employees and non-employee directors. The principal types of share-based awards available under the Equity Plan may include, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units (RSUs), deferred stock units (DSUs), performance-vesting restricted stock units (PSUs) and other equity-based or cash-based awards. 
  The components of share-based compensation expense are as follows:  

(a)      For the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  ,   we capitalized   $1 million   of share-based compensation expense to inventory; for the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , amounts capitalized to inventory were insignificant. For the three and   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , we capitalized   $1 million   of share-based compensation expense to inventory.  
   (b)      Includes additional share-based compensation expense as a result of accelerated vesting of the outstanding stock options and the settlement, on a pro-rata basis, of other equity awards of terminated employees in connection with our operational efficiency initiative and supply network strategy for the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , of approximately   $1 million  , which is included in   Restructuring charges/(benefits) and certain acquisition-related costs  . For the three months ended   October 2, 2016  , and the three and   nine months ended     September 27, 2015  , the amounts were insignificant.  
  During the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , the company granted   930,441   stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of   $42.32   per stock option and a weighted-average fair value of   $11.29   per option. The fair-value based method for valuing each Zoetis stock option grant on the grant date uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which incorporates a number of valuation assumptions. The weighted-average fair value was estimated based on the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of   1.55%  ; expected dividend yield of   0.89%  ; expected stock price volatility of   26.75%  ; and expected term of   6.5   years. In general, stock options vest after   P3Y   years of continuous service and the values determined through this fair-value based method generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into   Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses,   or   Research and development expenses,   as appropriate. 
  During the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , the company granted   732,671   RSUs with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $  42.10   per RSU. RSUs are accounted for using a fair-value-based method that utilizes the closing price of Zoetis common stock on the date of grant. In general, RSUs vest after   three   years of continuous service from the grant date and the values are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into   Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses,   or   Research and development expenses,   as appropriate.   
  During the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , the company granted   198,445   PSUs with a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $50.20   per PSU. PSUs are accounted for using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The units underlying the PSUs will be earned and vested over a   three  -year performance period, based upon the total shareholder return of the company in comparison to the total shareholder return of the companies comprising the S P 500 index at the start of the performance period (Relative TSR). The weighted-average fair value was estimated based on volatility assumptions of Zoetis common stock and an average of peer companies, which were   23.8%   and   25.2%  , respectively. Depending on the company s Relative TSR performance at the end of the performance period, the recipient may earn between   0%   and   200%   of the target number of units. Vested units are settled in shares of the company s common stock. PSU values are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term into   Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses,   or   Research and development expenses,   as appropriate.   
   
           13. 
    Stockholders' Equity  
     Zoetis is authorized to issue   6 billion   shares of common stock and   1 billion   shares of preferred stock.  
  In November 2014, the company's Board of Directors authorized a   $500 million   share repurchase program. Purchases of Zoetis shares may be made at the discretion of management, depending on market conditions and business needs. As of   October 2, 2016  , there was approximately   $75 million   remaining under this authorization.

           15. 
    Commitments and Contingencies    
     We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see   Note 7. Income Taxes  . 
           A. 
    Legal Proceedings  
     Our non-tax contingencies include, among others, the following:  
  
   18   | 

     Table of Contents  

Product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include injury, consumer, off-label promotion, antitrust and breach of contract claims.  
                
    Commercial and other matters, which can include product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings.  
                
    Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents or those of third parties on various products or processes.  
                
    Government investigations, which can involve regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and in other countries.  
     Certain of these contingencies could result in losses, including damages, fines and/or civil penalties, and/or criminal charges, which could be substantial.  
  We believe that we have strong defenses in these types of matters, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. 
  We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but the assessment process relies on estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.  
  Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions. 
  The principal matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is significant for financial reporting and disclosure purposes, we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors in order to assess materiality, such as, among other things, the amount of damages and the nature of any other relief sought in the proceeding, if such damages and other relief are specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be a class action and our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader s judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information about the company that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent.  
  PregSure         
  We have received in total approximately   255   claims in Europe and New Zealand seeking damages related to calves claimed to have died of Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia (BNP) on farms where PregSure BVD, a vaccine against Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD), was used. BNP is a rare syndrome that first emerged in cattle in Europe in 2006. Studies of BNP suggest a potential association between the administration of PregSure and the development of BNP, although no causal connection has been established. The cause of BNP is not known.  
  In   2010  , we voluntarily stopped sales of PregSure BVD in Europe, and recalled the product at wholesalers while investigations into possible causes of BNP continued. In   2011  , after incidences of BNP were reported in New Zealand, we voluntarily withdrew the marketing authorization for PregSure throughout the world.  
  We have settled approximately   168   of these claims for amounts that are not material individually or in the aggregate. Investigations into possible causes of BNP continue and these settlements may not be representative of any future claims resolutions.  
  Ulianopolis, Brazil 
  In February 2012, the Municipality of Ulianopolis (State of Para, Brazil) filed a complaint against Fort Dodge Sa de Animal Ltda. (FDSAL) and   five   other large companies alleging that waste sent to a local waste incineration facility for destruction, but that was not ultimately destroyed as the facility lost its operating permit, caused environmental impacts requiring cleanup.  
  The Municipality is seeking recovery of cleanup costs purportedly related to FDSAL's share of all waste accumulated at the incineration facility awaiting destruction, and compensatory damages to be allocated among the   six   defendants. We believe we have strong arguments against the claim, including defense strategies against any claim of joint and several liability.  
  At the request of the Municipal prosecutor, in April 2012, the lawsuit was suspended for   one   year. Since that time, the prosecutor has initiated investigations into the Municipality's actions in the matter as well as the efforts undertaken by the   six   defendants to remove and dispose of their individual waste from the incineration facility. On October 3, 2014, the Municipal prosecutor announced that the investigation remained ongoing and outlined the terms of a proposed Term of Reference (a document that establishes the minimum elements to be addressed in the preparation of an Environmental Impact Assessment), under which the companies would be liable to withdraw the waste and remediate the area. On March 5, 2015, we presented our response to the prosecutor s proposed Term of Reference, arguing that the proposed terms were overly general in nature, and expressing our interest in discussing alternatives to address the matter. The prosecutor agreed to consider our

     Table of Contents  

request to engage a technical consultant to conduct an environmental diagnostic of the contaminated area. On May 29, 2015, we, in conjunction with the other defendant companies, submitted a draft cooperation agreement to the prosecutor, which outlined the proposed terms and conditions for the engagement of a technical consultant to conduct the environmental diagnostic. On August 19, 2016, the parties entered into a cooperation agreement with the prosecutor, pursuant to which a third-party consultant will conduct a limited environmental assessment of the site  . 
  Lascadoil Contamination in Animal Feed 
  An investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Michigan Department of Agriculture is ongoing to determine how lascadoil, oil for industrial use, made its way into the feed supply of certain turkey and hog feed mills in Michigan. The contaminated feed is believed to have caused the deaths of approximately   50,000   turkeys and the contamination (but not death) of at least   20,000   hogs in August 2014. While it remains an open question as to how the lascadoil made its way into the animal feed, the allegations are that lascadoil intended to be sold for reuse as biofuel was inadvertently sold to producers of soy oil, who in turn, unknowingly sold the contaminated soy oil to fat recycling vendors, who then sold the contaminated soy oil to feed mills for use in animal feed. Indeed, related to the FDA investigation, Shur-Green Farms LLC, a producer of soy oil, recalled certain batches of soy oil allegedly contaminated with lascadoil on October 13, 2014. 
  During the course of its investigation, the FDA identified the process used to manufacture Zoetis  Avatec  (lasalocid sodium) and Bovatec  (lasalocid sodium) products as one possible source of the lascadoil, since lascadoil contains small amounts of lasalocid, the active ingredient found in both products. Zoetis has historically sold any and all industrial lascadoil byproduct to an environmental company specializing in waste disposal. The environmental company is contractually obligated to incinerate the lascadoil or resell it for use in biofuel. Under the terms of the agreement, the environmental company is expressly prohibited from reselling the lascadoil to be used as a component in food. The FDA inspected the Zoetis site where Avatec and Bovatec are manufactured, and found no evidence that Zoetis was involved in the contamination of the animal feed.  
  On March 10, 2015, plaintiffs Restaurant Recycling, LLC (Restaurant Recycling) and Superior Feed Ingredients, LLC (Superior), both of whom are in the fat recycling business, filed a complaint in the Seventeenth Circuit Court for the State of Michigan against Shur-Green Farms alleging negligence and breach of warranty claims arising from their purchase of soy oil allegedly contaminated with lascadoil. Plaintiffs resold the allegedly contaminated soy oil to turkey feed mills for use in feed ingredient. Plaintiffs also named Zoetis as a defendant in the complaint alleging that Zoetis failed to properly manufacture its products and breached an implied warranty that the soy oil was fit for use at turkey and hog mills. Zoetis was served with the complaint on June 3, 2015, and we filed our answer, denying all allegations, on July 15, 2015. On August 10, 2015, several of the turkey feed mills filed a joint complaint against Restaurant Recycling, Superior, Shur-Green Farms and others, alleging claims for negligence, misrepresentation, and breach of warranty, arising out of their alleged purchase and use of the contaminated soy oil. The complaint raises only   one   count against Zoetis for negligence. We filed an answer to the complaint on November 2, 2015, denying the allegation. On May 16, 2015,   two   additional turkey producers filed a complaint in the Seventeenth Circuit Court for the State of Michigan against the company, Restaurant Recycling, Superior, Shur-Green Farms and others, alleging claims for negligence and breach of warranties. We filed an answer to the complaint on June 20, 2016, denying the allegations. The Court has consolidated all   three   cases for purposes of discovery and disposition. We believe we have strong arguments against all claims. 
  Other Matters 
  The European Commission published a decision on alleged competition law infringements by several human health pharmaceutical companies on June 19, 2013. One of the involved legal entities is Alpharma LLC (previously having the name Zoetis Products LLC). Alpharma LLC's involvement is solely related to its human health activities prior to Pfizer's acquisition of King/Alpharma. Zoetis paid a fine in the amount of Euro   11 million   (approximately $  14 million  ) and was reimbursed by Pfizer in accordance with the Global Separation Agreement between Pfizer and Zoetis, which provides that Pfizer is obligated to indemnify Zoetis for any liabilities arising out of claims not related to its animal health assets. We filed an appeal of the decision on September 6, 2013 to the General Court of the European Union. On September 8, 2016, the General Court upheld the decision of the European Commission. We have until November 25, 2016, in which to file a further appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union. 
  In July 2014, we reached a commercial settlement with several large poultry customers in Mexico associated with specific lots of a Zoetis poultry vaccine. Although there have been no quality or efficacy issues with the manufacturing of this vaccine, certain shipments from several lots in Mexico may have experienced an issue in storage with a third party in Mexico that could have impacted their efficacy. We issued a recall of these lots in July 2014 and the product is currently unavailable in Mexico. We recorded a   $13 million   charge in   Other (income)/deductions net   in the second quarter of 2014, and we do not expect any significant additional charges related to this issue. In the third quarter of 2014, we were notified of an insurance recovery of   $1 million   and have recorded this in   Other (income)/deductions net  . 
  On March 30, 2015, we were served with a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by   two   additional customers in Mexico, alleging damages suffered as a result of the use of poultry vaccines obtained from the recalled lots discussed above. We have moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety on grounds that the complaint fails to properly state a claim on which relief can be granted. On September 16, 2015, the Court granted the motion in part and denied it in part, dismissing all claims arising out of tort or fraud. As a result, the only claims remaining in the lawsuit are based in contract, namely breach of express warranty, breach of certain implied warranties, and unjust enrichment. 
           B. 
    Guarantees and Indemnifications  
     In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or related to activities prior to the transaction. These indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters and patent-infringement claims. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally  
  
   20   | 

     Table of Contents  

subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of   October 2, 2016  , recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications were not significant.  
   
           16. 
    Segment and Other Revenue Information  
              A. 
    Segment Information  
     We manage our operations through   two   geographic regions. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Within each of these operating segments, we offer a diversified product portfolio, including vaccines, parasiticides, anti-infectives, medicated feed additives and other pharmaceuticals, for both livestock and companion animal customers.  
  Operating Segments 
  Our operating segments are the United States and International. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenue and earnings of the   two   operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation.  
  Other Costs and Business Activities  
  Certain costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the following:  
             
    Other business activities   includes our Client Supply Services (CSS) contract manufacturing results, as well as expenses associated with our dedicated veterinary medicine research and development organization, research alliances, U.S. regulatory affairs and other operations focused on the development of our products. Other R D-related costs associated with non-U.S. market and regulatory activities are generally included in the international commercial segment.  
                
    Corporate  , which is responsible for platform functions such as business technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development, and communications, among others. These costs also include compensation costs and other miscellaneous operating expenses not charged to our operating segments, as well as interest income and expense.  
                
    Certain transactions and events such as (i)   Purchase accounting adjustments  , where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; (ii)   Acquisition-related activities  , where we incur costs associated with acquiring and integrating newly acquired businesses, such as transaction costs and integration costs; and (iii)   Certain significant items  , which comprise substantive, unusual items that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis, such as certain costs related to becoming an independent public company, restructuring charges and implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives that are not associated with an acquisition, certain asset impairment charges, certain legal and commercial settlements and the impact of divestiture-related gains and losses.  
                
    Other unallocated   includes (i) certain overhead expenses associated with our global manufacturing operations not charged to our operating segments; (ii) certain costs associated with business technology and finance that specifically support our global manufacturing operations; (iii) certain supply chain and global logistics costs; and (iv) procurement costs. 
     Segment Assets  
  We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were approximately $  7.7 billion   at   October 2, 2016  , and   $7.9 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .

Review Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  The Shareholders and Board of Directors  
  Zoetis Inc.: 
  We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Zoetis Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of   October 2, 2016  , and the related condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three and nine-month periods ended   October 2, 2016  , and   September 27, 2015  , and the related condensed consolidated statements of equity and cash flows for the nine-month periods ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  . These condensed consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  
    
  We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
  Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated financial statements as of   October 2, 2016  , and for the three and nine-month periods ended   October 2, 2016  , and   September 27, 2015  , referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
  We have previously audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Zoetis Inc. and subsidiaries as of   December 31, 2015  , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 24, 2016, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
      
  Overview of our business  
  We are a global leader in the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines and vaccines, with a focus on both livestock and companion animals. For more than 60 years we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them.  
  We manage our operations through two geographic operating segments. Within each of these operating segments, we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs. Our two operating segments are the United States (U.S.) and International. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 16. Segment and Other Revenue Information  .  
  We directly market our products to veterinarians and livestock producers located in approximately 45 countries across North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and South America, and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate. Through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, we believe we are the largest animal health medicines and vaccines business as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole. In markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products.  
  We believe our investments in the industry s largest sales organization, including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists, our high-quality manufacturing and reliability of supply, and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs, has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers. Our research and development (R D) efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers. Additionally, our management team s focus on improving operational and cost efficiencies increases the likelihood of achieving our core growth strategies and enhancing long-term value for our shareholders. 
  A summary of our 2016 performance compared with the comparable 2015 period follows:

  Our operating environment  
  For a description of our operating environment, including factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results, see "Our Operating Environment" in the MD A of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Set forth below are updates to certain of the factors disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  Quarterly Variability of Financial Results  
  Our quarterly financial results are subject to variability related to a number of factors including but not limited to: weather patterns, herd management decisions, economic conditions, regulatory actions, competitive dynamics, disease outbreaks, product and geographic mix, timing of price increases and timing of investment decisions.  
  Disease outbreaks   
  Sales of our livestock products could be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals. Outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of such products, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, which may reduce demand for our products. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Alternatively, sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase. 
  For example, from December 2014 through June 2015, highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus infections were reported in domestic poultry, captive birds and wild birds in the United States, with a majority of confirmed infections occurring in backyard and commercial poultry flocks. The egg and turkey industry were the most impacted by this occurrence of avian influenza. USDA surveillance indicates that more than 48 million birds were affected (either infected or exposed) in at least 20 states. Although no new H5 avian influenza infections have been detected in the United States since June 2015, an outbreak of highly pathogenic H7 avian influenza infections was reported in a commercial turkey flock in Indiana in January 2016, and both forms of the virus continue to pose a threat to the poultry industry. In March 2016, we were granted a conditional license from the USDA for a vaccine to help prevent avian influenza, and in June 2016, we were awarded a contract to supply the USDA with this vaccine for the National Veterinary Stockpile. The vaccine is intended for use in chickens as an aid in the prevention of disease caused by the H5N1 subtype of the virus. The USDA will determine if a vaccination program should be implemented. It is important to note that human infection with avian influenza viruses has not occurred from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products. We are

closely monitoring the developments as this situation unfolds and currently believe the impact on our 2016 global revenue will not be significant. 
  Foreign exchange rates  
  Significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Our products are sold in more than 100 countries and, as a result, our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates. For the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , approximately   46%   of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenue in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, euro, U.K. pound, and other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenue, cost of goods and expenses, and consequently, net income. Exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations. These fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances. For the   nine months ended     October 2, 2016  , approximately   54%   of our total revenue was in U.S. dollars. Our year-over-year revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by   4%   from changes in foreign currency values relative to the U.S. dollar.  
  Effective March 10, 2016, the Venezuela government made the following changes to its foreign currency exchange mechanisms: (i) the three-tier exchange rate system existing in the country changed to a dual system with the elimination of the SICAD rate, (ii) the official CENCOEX rate was replaced with DIPRO and was devalued from 6.3 to 10 Venezuelan bolivars per U.S. dollar, and (iii) the SIMADI rate was replaced with DICOM. As of   October 2, 2016  , the Venezuelan bolivar to U.S. dollar exchange rates were the DIPRO rate of 10 and the DICOM rate of   658  . Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, we use the DICOM rate to report our Venezuela financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  On November 30, 2015, we recorded a net remeasurement loss of $89 million on bolivar-denominated net monetary assets, primarily related to cash deposits in Venezuela. As a result, as of August 28 2016, our net monetary assets in Venezuela were insignificant. Our revenue from Venezuela was less than $1 million for the nine months ended August 28, 2016, as compared with approximately $57 million for the nine months ended August 23, 2015. 
   
  Comparability of historical results and our relationship with Pfizer 
  Our historical expenses are not necessarily indicative of the expenses we currently incur as an independent public company. With respect to support functions, for example, for the periods prior to our initial public offering, our historical combined financial statements included expense allocations for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis within Pfizer, such as expenses for business technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, and, to a lesser extent, business development, public affairs and procurement, among others. Following our initial public offering, pursuant to agreements with Pfizer, Pfizer has provided us with some of the services related to these functions on a transitional basis in exchange for agreed-upon fees, and we have incurred other costs to replace the services and resources that were previously provided by Pfizer. Our current and future total costs related to such support functions may differ from the costs charged under these agreements with Pfizer, or that were historically allocated to us from Pfizer. For additional information regarding our ongoing agreements with Pfizer, see   Note 20. Transactions and Agreements with Pfizer   in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Following our initial public offering, we have incurred certain nonrecurring costs related to becoming an independent public company, including the creation of standalone systems and infrastructure, site separation, new branding (which includes changes to the manufacturing process for required new packaging), and certain legal registration and patent assignment costs.  
  Recent acquisitions and government-mandated divestitures  
  The assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of acquired businesses are included in our results commencing from their respective acquisition dates.  
  On November 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Pharmaq, a privately held Norwegian company. For additional information, see Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 4A. Acquisitions and Divestitures: Acquisitions- Acquisition of Pharmaq  .  
  On February 10, 2015, we completed the purchase of certain assets of Abbott Animal Health, a subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories. For additional information, see Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 4A. Acquisitions and Divestitures: Acquisitions- Acquisition of Abbott Animal Health  .

Analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of income 
  The following discussion and analysis of our statements of income should be read along with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in   Part I- Item 1   of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments.  
            (a)   
    Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in   Amortization of intangible assets   as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in   Cost of sales  ,   Selling, general and administrative expenses   or   Research and development expenses  , as appropriate.  
      
  Revenue  
  Three months ended October 2, 2016     vs.     three months ended September 27, 2015     
  Total revenue   increased   by $  27 million   in the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   three months ended September 27, 2015  , reflecting higher operational revenue of $  43 million  , or   4%  . Operational revenue growth (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Operational revenue growth was comprised primarily of the following: 
             
    increased sales of Apoquel        and new product launches, which contributed approximately 5%; 
                
    recent acquisitions, primarily Pharmaq, which contributed approximately 3%; and 
                
    growth of our in-line products, which contributed approximately 1%, of which price comprised 2% and was partially offset by 1% volume declines, 
     partially offset by: 
             
    our product and market rationalization as part of the operational efficiency initiative, which resulted in a decline of approximately 5%. 
     Foreign exchange reduced our reported revenue growth by $  16 million  , or   2  %. 
  Nine months ended October 2, 2016     vs.     nine months ended September 27, 2015     
  Total revenue   increased   by $  120 million   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , reflecting higher operational revenue of $  245 million  , or   7%  . An estimated 2% of operational revenue growth is the result of six additional days in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015 due to our accounting calendar. Inclusive of those additional days, operational revenue growth was comprised primarily of the following: 
             
    increased sales of Apoquel        and new product launches, which contributed approximately 5%; 
                
    growth of our in-line products, which contributed approximately 4%, of which price comprised 2% and volume comprised 2%; and

  Certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments.  
  During 2015, we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program, which is incremental to the supply network strategy that was previously announced. These initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios, changing our selling approach in certain markets and reducing our presence in certain countries, and planning to sell or exit ten manufacturing sites over the long term. As of   October 2, 2016  , we divested   3   U.S. manufacturing sites, one international manufacturing site, and our   55 percent   ownership share of a Taiwan joint venture, inclusive of its related manufacturing site, and exited one international manufacturing site. We are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with non-customer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes. As part of this initiative, we expect to reduce certain positions through divestitures, normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately   2,000   to   2,500  , subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries. As of October 2, 2016, approximately 1,800 positions have been eliminated and additional reductions are expected primarily over the next nine months.  
  Our acquisition-related costs primarily relate to restructuring charges for employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the future, as well as integration costs. The majority of our net restructuring charges generally relate to termination costs, but we have also exited a number of distributor and other contracts and performed facility rationalization efforts. Our integration costs are generally comprised of consulting costs related to the integration of systems and processes, as well as product transfer costs.  
  For additional information regarding restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs, see Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 5. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives. 
  Three months ended October 2, 2016   vs.   three months ended September 27, 2015 
  Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs   decreased   by $  9 million   in the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   three months ended September 27, 2015  , primarily as a result of lower asset impairment charges ($8 million) and lower integration costs ($5 million), partially offset by higher employee termination costs ($3 million).  
  Nine months ended October 2, 2016   vs.   nine months ended September 27, 2015    
  Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs   decreased   by $  295 million   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , primarily as a result of lower employee termination costs ($257 million) and lower asset impairment charges ($34 million). The nine months ended October 2, 2016, includes a net reduction in employee termination accruals associated with our operational efficiency initiative, primarily as a result of higher than expected voluntary attrition rates experienced in the first half of 2016. The nine months ended September 27, 2015, includes employee termination costs and asset impairment charges associated with the launch of our operational efficiency initiative and supply network strategy.

Operating Segment Results   
  We believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth, but also  operational growth.  Operational growth is defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange.  
  On a global basis, the mix of revenue between livestock and companion animal products was as follows:

  Three months ended October 2, 2016   vs.   three months ended September 27, 2015 
  U.S. operating segment  
  U.S. segment revenue   increased   by $  8 million  , or   1%  , in the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   three months ended September 27, 2015  , reflecting   declines   of approximately $  7 million   in livestock products and   growth   of approximately $  15 million   in companion animal products.  
             
    Livestock revenue declined primarily due to product rationalizations as part of the company s operational efficiency initiative, which impacted both poultry and swine. Swine also declined due to increased competition. The declines were partially offset by increased sales of cattle products due to promotional activities.  
                
    Companion animal revenue growth was driven by increased sales of Apoquel       , in addition to several new product launches, including Simparica   .   Growth was partially offset by declines in surgical fluid products. 
     U.S. segment earnings   increased   by $  16 million  , or   4%  , in the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   three months ended September 27, 2015  , primarily due to revenue growth with improved gross margin as a result of favorable product mix.   
  International operating segment  
  International segment revenue   increased   by   $16 million  , or   3%  , in the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   three months ended September 27, 2015  . Operational revenue   increased   by   $32 million  , or   6%  , driven by   growth   of approximately $  6 million   in livestock products and   growth   of approximately $  26 million   in companion animal products.  
  
   36   | 

Livestock growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of Pharmaq, with sales primarily in Chile and Norway. Growth also benefited from an increase in sales of cattle products in Brazil and swine products in China  .   Growth was tempered by our operational efficiency initiative, which includes the impact of our business decisions in Venezuela and India, in addition to product rationalizations. 
                
    Companion animal revenue growth resulted primarily from increased sales of Apoquel       ,       due in part from initial customer purchases in Japan.       Other new product launches also increased sales, primarily in Europe. In addition, sales grew in China, primarily in our vaccine portfolio, due to increased field force expansions and positive medicalization rates. Growth was partially offset by product rationalizations as a result of the company s operational efficiency initiative and business decisions in Venezuela.  
     Additionally, segment revenue was   unfavorably   impacted by foreign exchange, which decreased revenue by approximately   $16 million  , or   3%  , primarily driven by the depreciation of the British pound and the Argentine peso, partially offset by appreciation of the Japanese yen. 
  International segment earnings   increased   by $  37 million  , or   17%  , in the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   three months ended September 27, 2015  . Operational earnings growth was   $36 million  , or   17%  , primarily due to higher revenue with improved gross margins and a decline in operating expenses.  
  Nine months ended October 2, 2016   vs.   nine months ended September 27, 2015    
  U.S. operating segment  
  Including the impact of six additional calendar days, U.S. segment revenue   increased   by $  124 million  , or   7%  , in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , reflecting   declines   of approximately $  12 million   in livestock products and   growth   of approximately $  136 million   in companion animal products.  
             
    Livestock revenue declined primarily due to the impact of our operational efficiency initiative, which impacted both poultry and swine. Additionally unfavorable producer market conditions in the dairy sector and competition for swine products impacted growth. This was partially offset by demand for cattle products in the beef sector due to expanding herd sizes and promotional activities. 
                
    Companion animal revenue growth was driven primarily by increased sales of Apoquel       , new product launches, and initial sales of other products into expanded distribution relationships  . 
     U.S. segment earnings   increased   by $  101 million  , or   10%  , in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , primarily due to revenue growth with improved gross margin, partly offset by higher operating expenses.   
  International operating segment  
  Including the impact of six additional calendar days, International segment revenue decreased by   $8 million   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  . Operational revenue   increased   by   $117 million  , or   7%  , driven by   growth   of approximately $  46 million   in livestock products and   growth   of approximately $  71 million   in companion animal products.  
             
    Livestock growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of Pharmaq, with sales primarily in Chile and Norway. Growth also benefited from swine performance, primarily in China  .   Growth was partially offset by our operational efficiency initiative, which includes the impact of our business decisions in Venezuela and India, in addition to product rationalizations. 
                
    Companion animal revenue growth resulted primarily from increased sales of Apoquel       , in addition to new product launches primarily in Europe. Sales also benefited from demand for our vaccines portfolio in China, due to increased field force expansions and positive medicalization rates. 
     Additionally, segment revenue was   unfavorably   impacted by foreign exchange, which decreased revenue by approximately   $125 million  , or   7%  , primarily driven by the depreciation of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. 
  International segment earnings   increased   by $  101 million  , or   15%  , in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  . Operational earnings growth was   $143 million  , or   21%  , primarily due to higher revenue, improved gross margin, and a decline in operating expenses.  
  Other business activities 
  Other business activities includes our Client Supply Services (CSS) contract manufacturing results, as well as expenses associated with our dedicated veterinary medicine research and development organization, research alliances, U.S. regulatory affairs and other operations focused on the development of our products. Other R D-related costs associated with non-U.S. market and regulatory activities are generally included in the respective regional segment.  
  Three months ended October 2, 2016   vs.   three months ended September 27, 2015 
  Other business activities net loss   declined   by $  2 million  , or   3%  , in the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   three months ended September 27, 2015  , reflecting reduction in spending driven by our operational efficiency initiative and higher sales in our contract manufacturing business, partially offset by the addition of Pharmaq R D expense.

Nine months ended October 2, 2016   vs.   nine months ended September 27, 2015 
  Including the impact of six additional calendar days, other business activities net loss   increased   by $  11 million  , or   5%  , in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , reflecting the addition of Pharmaq R D expense, an increase in R D spending driven by the timing of our portfolio execution and an increase in professional services, partially offset by a reduction in spending driven by our operational efficiency initiative and higher sales in our contract manufacturing business. 
  Reconciling items 
  Reconciling items include certain costs that are not allocated to our operating segments results, such as costs associated with the following: 
             
    Corporate,   which includes certain costs associated with business technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development and communications, among others. These costs also include certain compensation costs and other miscellaneous operating expenses that are not charged to our operating segments, as well as interest income and expense;  
                
    Certain transactions and events such as (i)   Purchase accounting adjustments  , which includes expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment; (ii)   Acquisition-related activities  , which includes costs for acquisition and integration; and (iii)   Certain significant items  , which includes non-acquisition-related restructuring charges, certain asset impairment charges, stand-up costs, certain legal and commercial settlements, and costs associated with cost reduction/productivity initiatives; and 
                
    Other unallocated  , which includes (i) certain overhead expenses associated with our global manufacturing operations not charged to our operating segments; (ii) certain costs associated with business technology and finance that specifically support our global manufacturing operations; (iii) certain supply chain and global logistics costs; and (iv) procurement costs. 
     Three months ended October 2, 2016   vs.   three months ended September 27, 2015 
  Corporate expenses   increased   by $  21 million  , or   15%  , in the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   three months ended September 27, 2015  , primarily     due to higher interest expense, net of capitalized interest, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by a decline in certain compensation costs not allocated to our operating segments.  
  Other unallocated expenses   declined   by   $2 million  , or   4%  , in the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   three months ended September 27, 2015  , primarily     due to lower global manufacturing and supply costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. 
  Nine months ended October 2, 2016   vs.   nine months ended September 27, 2015 
  Including the impact of six additional calendar days, corporate expenses   increased   by $  107 million  , or   27%  , in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , primarily     due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and higher interest expense, net of capitalized interest.  
  Other unallocated expenses   declined   by   $60 million  , or   34%  , in the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , primarily     due to lower global manufacturing and supply costs and favorable foreign exchange.

  Adjusted net income  
  General description of adjusted net income (a non-GAAP financial measure)  
  Adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors  understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. We report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations, the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of our products, prior to considering certain income statement elements. We have defined adjusted net income as net income attributable to Zoetis before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items described below. The adjusted net income measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP reported net income attributable to Zoetis.  
  The adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us. We measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. The following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized:  
             
    senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted net income basis;  
                
    our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted net income basis; and  
                
    other goal setting and performance measurements. 
     Despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.  
  We also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted net income measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to this metric. A limitation of the adjusted net income measure is that it provides a view of our  
  
   38   | 

     Table of Contents  

operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. We also use other specifically tailored metrics designed to achieve the highest levels of performance.   
  Purchase accounting adjustments    
  Adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These impacts, primarily associated with the acquisition of the Pharmaq business (acquired in November 2015),  certain assets of Abbott Animal Health (acquired in February 2015), King Animal Health (KAH) (acquired in 2011), Fort Dodge Animal Health (FDAH) (acquired in 2009), and Pharmacia Animal Health business (acquired in 2003), include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increase/decrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets. Therefore, the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges.  
  While certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. We believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R D costs previously have been expensed.  
  A completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income. These components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above. We have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. For example, our R D costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. In addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. As such, in total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.  
  Acquisition-related costs    
  Adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction and integration costs associated with significant business combinations or net asset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to acquire and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. We have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.  
  We believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees  a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business.  
  The integration costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts generally ending within three years of the transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. For example, due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the FDA and/or other regulatory authorities.  
  Certain significant items    
  Adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. Certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. Unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be nonrecurring; or items that relate to products that we no longer sell. While not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be costs related to becoming an independent public company; a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our non-acquisition-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by U.S. GAAP; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; significant currency devaluation; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to legal matters. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies  . Our normal, ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.

Reconciliation  
  A reconciliation of net income attributable to Zoetis, as reported under U.S. GAAP, to adjusted net income follows:   

* Calculation not meaningful. 
  Certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments. 
            (a)   
    The effective tax rate on adjusted pretax income is   31.6%   and   25.1%   for the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. The   higher   effective tax rate for the   three months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   three months ended September 27, 2015  , was primarily attributable to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings as well as repatriation costs. 
     The effective tax rate on adjusted pretax income is   31.3%   and   27.5%   for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. The   higher   effective tax rate for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  , was primarily attributable to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings as well as repatriation costs, offset by a $7 million discrete tax benefit related to the adoption of a new accounting standard in 2016 requiring the excess tax benefits for share-based payments to be recognized as a component of   Provision for taxes on income  , and a $4 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2015 related to prior period deferred tax adjustments. 
  A reconciliation of reported diluted earnings per share (EPS), as reported under U.S. GAAP, to non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS follows: 

Certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments. 
            (a)   
    Diluted earnings per share was computed using the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period plus the common stock equivalents related to stock options, RSUs, PSUs and DSUs.  
     Adjusted net income includes the following charges for each of the periods presented:

Adjusted net income, as shown above, excludes the following items:  

Certain amounts may reflect rounding adjustments.  
            (a)   
    Amortization and depreciation expenses related to   Purchase accounting adjustments   with respect to identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. 
               (b)   
    Amortization and depreciation expense, as well as fair value adjustments to acquired inventory  . 
               (c)   
    Income taxes include the tax effect of the associated pre-tax amounts, calculated by determining the jurisdictional location of the pre-tax amounts and applying that jurisdiction's applicable tax rate. Income taxes in   Purchase accounting adjustments   for the nine months ended   October 2, 2016  , and   September 27, 2015  , includes a tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred taxes as a result of a change in tax rates. Income taxes in   Acquisition-related costs   for the nine months ended   October 2, 2016  , and   September 27, 2015  , includes a tax charge related to the acquisition of certain assets of Abbott Animal Health. Income taxes in   Certain significant items   for the nine months ended   October 2, 2016  , includes (i) a net tax benefit of approximately $7 million recorded in the third quarter of 2016, related to a revaluation of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities using the tax rates expected to be in place going forward as a result of the implementation of certain operational changes and (ii) a net tax charge of approximately $38 million recorded in the first half of 2016, related to the impact of the European Commission s negative decision on the excess profits rulings in Belgium. This net charge represents the recovery of prior tax benefits for the periods 2013 through 2015 offset by the revaluation of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities using the rates expected to be in place at the time of the reversal, and does not include any benefits associated with a successful appeal of the decision. Income taxes in   Certain significant items   for the nine months ended   September 27, 2015  , includes a net tax charge related to the revaluation of deferred taxes and other deferred tax adjustments. 
               (d)

  Accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts   decreased as a result of the timing of customer collections, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange.  
  Inventories   increased primarily in support of new product launches, the rebuilding of safety stock levels based on seasonality of our business and foreign exchange. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 9. Inventories  . 
  Assets held for sale   decreased as a result of the divestiture of   three   U.S. manufacturing sites, one international manufacturing site, and our   55 percent   ownership share of our Taiwan joint venture, inclusive of its related manufacturing site. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 4B. Acquisitions and Divestitures     Divestitures  . 
  Other current assets   increased primarily as a result of higher prepaid expenses. 
  Property, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation   increased primarily as a result of capital spending, partially offset by depreciation expense.   
  Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization   increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of a veterinary diagnostics business in Denmark in the third quarter of 2016, the impact of foreign exchange, the acquisition of a livestock business in South America in the first quarter of 2016 and an increase in the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of certain assets of Abbott Animal Health. These increases were partially offset by amortization expense. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 4A. Acquisitions and Divestitures     Acquisitions   and   Note 10. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.    
  Goodwill   increased primarily as a result of the impact of foreign exchange, the acquisition of a veterinary diagnostics business in Denmark in the third quarter of 2016 and the acquisition of a livestock business in South America in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by a reduction in the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of certain assets of Abbott Animal Health. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 4A. Acquisitions and Divestitures     Acquisitions   and   Note 10. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.    
  The net changes in   Noncurrent deferred tax assets  ,   Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, Income taxes payable   and   Other taxes payable   primarily reflect adjustments to the accrual for the income tax provision for the first none months of 2016, as well as the impact of the European Commission s negative decision on the excess profits rulings in Belgium and a revaluation of deferred taxes as a result of a change in tax rates and operational changes. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 7. Income Taxes.    
  Accounts payable   decreased as a result of the timing of payments.  
  Accrued compensation and related items   decreased, primarily due to payment of 2015 annual bonuses to eligible employees and 2015 employee savings plan contributions, partially offset by the pro-rata accrual of similar items for 2016. 
  Accrued expenses   and   Other current liabilities   decreased primarily as a result of payment of employee termination costs and the second quarter 2016 reduction in employee termination accruals associated with operational efficiency initiatives, payment of the contingent purchase price consideration to Abbott and lower contract rebate accruals. These decreases were partially offset by the recognition of the contingent purchase price consideration associated with the first quarter 2016 acquisition of certain intangible assets related to our livestock product portfolio. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 4A. Acquisitions and Divestitures     Acquisitions   and   Note 5. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives. 
  Other non-current liabilities   increased primarily due to the third quarter 2016 recognition of the contingent purchase price consideration associated with the acquisition of a veterinary diagnostics business in Denmark, partially offset by a reduction in the accrual of employee termination costs associated with our operational efficiency initiatives. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 5. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives.

Analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows     

* Calculation not meaningful. 
  Certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments.  
  Operating activities  
  Nine months ended     October 2, 2016     vs.     nine months ended     September 27, 2015    
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities was $  427 million   for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with net cash   provided by   operating activities of $  386 million   for the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  . The   increase   in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher income before allocation to noncontrolling interests, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and non-cash restructuring, and the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by higher inventory levels. 
     Investing activities  
  Nine months ended     October 2, 2016     vs.     nine months ended     September 27, 2015    
  Our net cash   used in   investing activities was $  155 million   for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with net cash   used in   investing activities of $  378 million   for the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  . The net cash used in investing activities for 2016 was due primarily to purchases of property, plant and equipment, the acquisition of a veterinary diagnostics business in Denmark and the acquisition of a livestock business in South America, partially offset by proceeds from the sales of certain manufacturing sites and products as part of the operational efficiency initiatives. The net cash used in investing activities for 2015 was due primarily to the acquisition of certain assets of Abbott Animal Health.  
  Financing activities 
  Nine months ended     October 2, 2016     vs.     nine months ended     September 27, 2015    
  Our net cash   used in   financing activities was $  775 million   for the   nine months ended October 2, 2016  , compared with net cash   used in   financing activities of   $271 million   for the   nine months ended September 27, 2015  . The net cash used in financing activities for 2016 was due primarily to the senior note payment in February 2016, the purchase of treasury shares, the payment of dividends and the contingent consideration payment to Abbott. The net cash used in financing activities for 2015 was primarily attributable to the purchase of treasury shares and the payment of dividends. 
   
  Analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources  
  While we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our future cash needs, this may be subject to the environment in which we operate. Risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph.  
  Global financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic, business and financial volatility. As markets change, we will continue to monitor our liquidity position, but there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing.

Selected measures of liquidity and capital resources  
  Certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow:   

(a)   
    Accounts receivable are usually collected over a period of 60 to 90 days  .   For the nine months ended   October 2, 2016  , compared with   December 31, 2015  , the number of days that accounts receivables are outstanding remained approximately the same. We regularly monitor our accounts receivable for collectability, particularly in markets where economic conditions remain uncertain. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. Our assessment is based on such factors as past due aging, historical and expected collection patterns, the financial condition of our customers, the robust nature of our credit and collection practices and the economic environment.  
     For additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the   Analysis of the condensed consolidated balance sheets   and   Analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows   sections of this MD A.  
  Credit facility and other lines of credit 
  In December 2012, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a five-year   $1.0 billion   senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which became effective in February 2013 upon the completion of the initial public offering and which expires in December 2017. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to   $1.5 billion  . The credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for such period) of   3.50:1  . Upon entering into a material acquisition, the maximum total leverage ratio increases to   4.25:1   and extends until the fourth full consecutive quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition. On November 10, 2015, we designated the acquisition of Pharmaq a material acquisition under the revolving credit agreement. For additional information, see Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures  . On February 19, 2016, we amended this financial covenant to add back to Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA, any operational efficiency restructuring charge (defined as charges recorded by the company during the second quarter of 2015, related to our operational efficiency program announced on May 5, 2015, in an aggregate amount for all such charges not to exceed $237 million) and Venezuela-related charges (defined as the write-down, impairment and other charges recorded by the company during the fourth quarter of 2015 relating to Venezuela, in an aggregate amount for all such charges not to exceed $95 million). 
  The credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (the ratio of EBITDA at the end of the period to interest expense for such period) of   3.50:1  . In addition, the credit facility contains other customary covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of   October 2, 2016  . There were no borrowings outstanding as of   October 2, 2016  , or   December 31, 2015  . 
  We have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding short-term borrowings. As of   October 2, 2016  , we had access to   $81 million   of lines of credit which expire at various times through 2017. We did not have any borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of   October 2, 2016  . Short-term borrowings outstanding related to these facilities were   $4 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  
  Domestic and international short-term funds 
  Many of our operations are conducted outside the United States. The amount of funds held in the United States will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business development activities. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of U.S. and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). Repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional United States, federal, state and local income tax payments. We record U.S. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, no accrual for U.S. taxes is provided. 
  Global economic conditions 
  The challenging economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate that it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. Due to our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. There can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future.

Debt 
  On November 13, 2015, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes (2015 senior notes), with an original issue discount of $2 million. On January 28, 2013, we issued   $3.65 billion   aggregate principal amount of our senior notes (the 2013 senior notes offering) in a private placement, with an original issue discount of   $10 million  .  
  The 2013 and 2015 senior notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indenture (collectively, the indenture) between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee. The indenture contains certain covenants, including limitations on our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur liens or engage in sale leaseback transactions. The indenture also contains restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets. In addition, the indenture contains other customary terms, including certain events of default, upon the occurrence of which the 2013 and 2015 senior notes may be declared immediately due and payable. 
  Pursuant to the indenture, we are able to redeem the 2013 and 2015 senior notes of any series, in whole or in part, at any time by paying a  make whole  premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Pursuant to our tax matters agreement with Pfizer, we will not be permitted to redeem the 2013 senior notes due 2023 pursuant to this optional redemption provision, except under limited circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade of the 2013 and 2015 senior notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard   Poor's Ratings Services, we are, in certain circumstances, required to make an offer to repurchase all of the outstanding 2013 and 2015 senior notes at a price equal to   101%   of the aggregate principal amount of the 2013 and 2015 senior notes together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. 
  The components of our long-term debt follow: 

Interest Rate Swap Contracts 
  The company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rates and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. In anticipation of issuing fixed-rate debt, we may use forward starting interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge against changes in interest rates that could impact expected future issuances of debt. To the extent these hedges of cash flows related to anticipated debt are effective, any unrealized gains or losses on the forward starting interest rate swaps are reported in   Accumulated other comprehensive loss   and are recognized in income over the life of the future fixed-rate notes. When the company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that an anticipated transaction will occur within the originally expected period of execution, or within an additional two-month period thereafter, changes to fair value accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognized immediately in earnings. 
  In the first nine months of 2016, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of   $250 million  , having a term of ten years and an effective date and mandatory termination date of December 2017. We designated these swaps as cash flow hedges against interest rate exposure related principally to the anticipated future issuance of fixed-rate debt to be used primarily to refinance our   1.875%   2013 senior note due in 2018.  
  Credit Ratings 
  Two major corporate debt-rating organizations, Moody's and S P, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
  The following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced long-term debt:

Contractual Obligations 
  On August 8, 2016, we acquired a veterinary diagnostics business in Denmark. The total purchase price of $80 million included cash of $72 million and an additional contingent payment of $8 million, due within 18 months of the acquisition date.  The contingent liability was recorded at the acquisition date fair value of approximately $8 million and was included in   Other noncurrent liabilities   at October 2, 2016. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire a livestock business. The acquisition complements our livestock biologic hormones product portfolio, primarily in South America. The total purchase price of $38 million was comprised of $5 million of cash paid, and $33 million of contingent consideration in the form of milestone payments, which are due upon the transfer of individual assets, and is expected to occur over the next two years. As of October 2, 2016, outstanding milestone payments of $22 million included $14 million and $8 million recorded within   Other current liabilities   and   Other noncurrent liabilities  , respectively.  
  Share Repurchase Program 
  In November 2014, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. Purchases of Zoetis shares may be made at the discretion of management, depending on market conditions and business needs. Share repurchases may be executed through various means, including open market or privately negotiated transactions. During the first nine months of 2016, approximately   five   million shares were repurchased. As of   October 2, 2016  , there was approximately   $75 million   remaining under this authorization.  
  Off-balance sheet arrangements  
  In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we may indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. These indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of   October 2, 2016  , or   December 31, 2015  , recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant.  
   
  New accounting standards 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Adopted as of     October 2, 2016  . 
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update that will require the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs as opposed to when the asset is sold to an outside third party. The provisions of the new standard are effective beginning January 1, 2018, for annual and interim reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted beginning on January 1, 2017. The new standard requires a modified retrospective adoption approach, as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are continuing to assess the potential impact that adopting this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet with a corresponding right of use asset. Leases will be classified as financing or operating which will drive the expense recognition pattern. For lessees, the income statement presentation and expense recognition pattern for financing and operating leases is similar to the current model for capital and operating leases, respectively. Accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged. Companies may elect to exclude short-term leases. The update also requires additional disclosures that will better enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The provisions of the new standard are effective beginning January 1, 2019, for annual and interim reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted beginning on January 1, 2017. The new standard requires a modified retrospective adoption approach, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We continue to assess the potential impact that adopting this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to simplify the measurement of inventory by requiring that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, rather than at the lower of cost or market, with market being defined as either replacement cost, net realizable value or net realizable value less a normal profit margin. The provisions of the new standard are effective beginning January 1, 2017, for annual and interim reporting periods. The guidance will be adopted prospectively and early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2017, the required effective date, and do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that outlines a new, single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. This update supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance includes a five-step model for determining how, when and how much revenue should be recognized. This update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We plan to adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2018, the required effective date. Early adoption is permitted beginning on January 1, 2017. The new standard allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective transition upon adoption. We continue to assess the transition method we will elect for adoption as well as the potential impact that adopting this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results    
  This report contains  forward-looking  statements. We generally identify forward-looking statements by using words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   could,   expect,   intend,   project,   plan,   predict,   believe,   seek,   continue,   outlook,   objective ,  target ,  may,   might,   will,   should,   can have,   likely  or the negative version of these words or comparable words or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future performance, actions or events. 
  In particular, forward-looking statements include statements relating to our indebtedness, our ability to make interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, our ability to satisfy the covenants contained in our indebtedness, the redemption of the notes, new systems infrastructure stand-up, future actions, business plans or prospects, prospective products, product approvals or products under development, product supply disruptions, R D costs, timing and likelihood of success, future operating or financial performance, future results of current and anticipated products and services, strategies, sales efforts, expenses, production efficiencies, production margins, interest rates, tax rates, changes in tax regimes and laws, foreign exchange rates, growth in emerging markets, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, plans related to share repurchases and dividends, our agreements with Pfizer, the expected timing and content of regulatory actions, government regulation and financial results. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, actions or events. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are potentially inaccurate assumptions. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past results and future plans and projected future results are the following: 
             
    emerging restrictions and bans on the use of antibacterials in food-producing animals; 
                
    perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products; 
                
    increased regulation or decreased governmental support relating to the raising, processing or consumption of food-producing animals; 
                
    fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and potential currency controls; 
                
    changes in tax laws and regulations; 
                
    legal factors, including product liability claims, antitrust litigation and governmental investigations, including tax disputes, environmental concerns, commercial disputes and patent disputes with branded and generic competitors, any of which could preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect the profitability of existing products; 
                
    failure to protect our intellectual property rights or to operate our business without infringing the intellectual property rights of others; 
                
    an outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals; 
                
    adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources; 
                
    adverse global economic conditions; 
                
    failure of our R D, acquisition and licensing efforts to generate new products; 
                
    the possible impact of competing products, including generic alternatives, on our products and our ability to compete against such products; 
                
    quarterly fluctuations in demand and costs; 
                
    governmental laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations, including without limitation, tax obligations and changes affecting the tax treatment by the United States of income earned outside the United States that may result from pending and possible future proposals; and 
                
    governmental laws and regulations affecting our interactions with veterinary healthcare providers. 
     However, there may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. These risks or uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by a forward-looking statement. You should not put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q and 8-K reports and our other filings with the SEC. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the above to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
     A significant portion of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition, our outstanding borrowings may be subject to risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our earnings. We manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using certain financial instruments. These practices may change as economic conditions change. 
  Foreign exchange risk 
  Our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and U.K. pound. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenue in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities.  
  Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany short-term foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from operations.  
  Our financial instrument holdings at   October 2, 2016  , were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. The fair values of these instruments were determined using Level 2 inputs. The sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign currency forward-exchange contracts at   October 2, 2016  , indicates that if the U.S. dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10%, the fair value of these contracts would increase by $33 million, and if the U.S. dollar were to weaken against all other currencies by 10%, the fair value of these contracts would decrease by $41 million. For additional details, see Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 8B. Financial Instruments: Derivative Financial Instruments  Foreign Exchange Risk  . 
  Interest rate risk 
  Our outstanding debt balances are fixed rate debt. While changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on our fixed rate debt, interest on our revolving credit facility will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations. At   October 2, 2016  , we had no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    Note 8B. Financial Instruments: Derivative Financial Instruments  Interest Rate Risk  .  
   
           Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures  
     Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company's management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation as of   October 2, 2016  , the company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable level of assurance in alerting them in a timely manner to material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  During our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   
  We have recently migrated many of our financial reporting and processing systems to an enterprise-wide solution. These system implementations were part of our ongoing stand-up efforts. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we have enhanced the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting process to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting.

  Risks related to manufacturing 
  Manufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls or unanticipated costs. 
  In order to sell our products, we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities. On December 31, 2015, we had a global manufacturing network consisting of 28 manufacturing sites located in 12 countries. As part of our operational efficiency program, we have subsequently exited, or are in the process of exiting, certain of these sites. For more information, see   Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Recent Developments   of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We also employ a network of approximately 200 third party contract manufacturing organizations, including a number owned by Pfizer. Many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are sole-sourced from certain manufacturing sites. 
  Minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes, such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing, could result in delays, inventory shortages, unanticipated costs, product recalls, product liability and/or regulatory action. In addition, a number of factors could cause production interruptions, including: 
             
    the failure of us or any of our vendors or suppliers, including logistical service providers, to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines; 
                
    construction delays; 
                
    equipment malfunctions; 
                
    shortages of materials; 
                
    labor problems; 
                
    natural disasters; 
                
    power outages; 
                
    criminal and terrorist activities; 
                
    changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in types of products produced, shipping distributions or physical limitations; and 
                
    the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near our production sites. 
     These interruptions could result in launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls, unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. For example, our manufacturing site in Medolla, Italy was damaged in an earthquake in May 2012, which resulted in production interruptions at that site. In addition, at the time of the launch we experienced challenges in manufacturing Apoquel that impacted our ability to meet customer demand. 
  Our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes. The unpredictability of a product's regulatory or commercial success or failure, the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites, and shifting customer demand (including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition) increase the potential for capacity imbalances. In addition, construction of sites is expensive, and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites, which is uncertain. 
  As part of our operational efficiency program, our manufacturing network is undergoing significant changes.  We may be unable to achieve the planned cost-savings from these changes. In addition, we may experience delays and disruptions in our supply network as a result of these activities. 
  Risks related to tax matters 
  The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. 
  The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The company s future effective tax rates could be  
  
   50   | 

affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. 
  For example, the European Commission opened formal investigations to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in certain European countries, including Belgium, comply with European Union rules on state aid. In the case of Belgium, the European Commission concluded on January 11, 2016, that the excess profits ruling violates the European Union s state aid rules. The impact of this conclusion is a net tax charge of approximately $38 million. This does not include any benefits associated with a successful appeal of the decision. The net charge of approximately $38 million relates to the Belgium government's recovery of benefits for the periods 2013 through 2015 offset by the revaluation of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities using the rates expected to be in place at the time of the reversal. In addition, on June 20, 2016, the Member States of the European Union adopted the anti-tax avoidance directive proposed on January 28, 2016, which is designed to provide uniform implementation of Base Erosion and Profits Shifting measures and other minimum taxation standards across Member States.  The Member states are required to implement all components of the directive by January 1, 2020. Once enacted by the Member states, the results of the directive could have an impact on our effective tax rate. In October 2016, the European Union also introduced a proposal to impose a uniform set of rules on taxing corporate profits, known as the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. This proposal is in its early stages but may have an impact to our effective tax rate.  
  In addition, our effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our cross-border arrangements and subject us to additional tax, adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability. The company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the company s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the United States or other material foreign jurisdictions, or if the ultimate determination of the company s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the company s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
