1.  
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation       Global Indemnity plc ( Global
Indemnity  or  the Company ) was incorporated on March 9, 2010 and is domiciled in Ireland. Global Indemnity replaced the Company s predecessor, United America Indemnity, Ltd., as the ultimate parent company as a result of a
re-domestication transaction in July, 2010. The Company s A ordinary shares are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol  GBLI.  
 The Company manages its business through three business segments: Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Reinsurance Operations. The Company s
Commercial Lines, managed in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, offers specialty property and casualty insurance products in the excess and surplus lines marketplace. The Company manages its Commercial Lines by differentiating them into three product
classifications: Penn-America, which markets property and general liability products to small commercial businesses through a select network of wholesale general agents with specific binding authority; United National, which markets insurance
products for targeted insured segments, including specialty products, such as property, general liability, and professional lines through program administrators with specific binding authority; and Diamond State, which markets property, casualty,
and professional lines products, which are developed by the Company s underwriting department by individuals with expertise in those lines of business, through wholesale brokers and also markets through program administrators having specific
binding authority. These product classifications comprise the Company s Commercial Lines business segment and are not considered individual business segments because each product has similar economic characteristics, distribution, and
coverage. The Company s Personal Lines segment, via the American Reliable Insurance Company ( American Reliable ) product classification, offers specialty personal lines and agricultural coverage through general and specialty agents
with specific binding authority on an admitted basis and is managed in Scottsdale, Arizona. Collectively, the Company s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The Company s Reinsurance
Operations consist solely of the operations of its Bermuda-based wholly-owned subsidiary, Global Indemnity Reinsurance Company, Ltd. ( Global Indemnity Reinsurance ). Global Indemnity Reinsurance is a treaty reinsurer of specialty
property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies. The Company s Reinsurance Operations segment provides reinsurance solutions through brokers and primary writers including insurance and reinsurance companies. The
Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments comprise the Company s U.S. Insurance Operations ( Insurance Operations ). See Note 12 for additional information regarding segments.  
 On September 30, 2016, Diamond State Insurance Company sold all the outstanding shares of capital stock of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, United
National Specialty Insurance Company, to an unrelated party. Diamond State Insurance Company received a one-time payment of $18.7 million and recognized a pretax gain of $6.9 million which is reflected in other income (loss). This
transaction will not have an impact on the Company s ongoing business operations. Going forward, any business previously written by United National Specialty Insurance Company has been and will be written by other companies within the
Company s U.S. Insurance Operations.   The interim consolidated financial statements are unaudited, but have been prepared in conformity with United
States of America generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), which differs in certain respects from those principles followed in reports to insurance regulatory authorities. The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.    The unaudited consolidated
financial statements include all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, of a normal recurring nature and are necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods. Results of operations for the quarters and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results of a full year. The accompanying notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial
statements contained in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Global
Indemnity and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 Excluding U.S. treasuries and agency bonds, the Company did not hold any debt or equity investments in a single issuer that was in excess of 4% and 5% of
shareholders  equity at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the Company s fixed maturities portfolio classified as
available for sale at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment
penalties.      
   The following table contains an analysis of the Company s securities with gross unrealized losses, categorized by the
period that the securities were in a continuous loss position as of September 30, 2016:     

(1)  
   Fixed maturities in a gross unrealized loss position for twelve months or longer are primarily comprised of non-credit losses on investment grade securities where management does not intend to sell, and it is
more likely than not that the Company will not be forced to sell the security before recovery. The Company has analyzed these securities and has determined that they are not other than temporarily impaired.

   Fixed maturities in a gross unrealized loss position for twelve months or longer are primarily comprised of non-credit losses on investment grade securities where management does not intend to sell, and it is
more likely than not that the Company will not be forced to sell the security before recovery. The Company has analyzed these securities and has determined that they are not other than temporarily impaired.   
 The Company regularly performs various analytical valuation procedures with respect to its investments, including reviewing
 
      9  

Table of Contents  

GLOBAL INDEMNITY PLC   

each fixed maturity security in an unrealized loss position to assess whether the security has a credit loss. Specifically, the Company considers credit rating, market price, and issuer
specific financial information, among other factors, to assess the likelihood of collection of all principal and interest as contractually due. Securities for which the Company determines that a credit loss is likely are subjected to further
analysis through discounted cash flow testing to estimate the credit loss to be recognized in earnings, if any. The specific methodologies and significant assumptions used by asset class are discussed below. Upon identification of such
securities and periodically thereafter, a detailed review is performed to determine whether the decline is considered other than temporary. This review includes an analysis of several factors, including but not limited to, the credit ratings
and cash flows of the securities and the magnitude and length of time that the fair value of such securities is below cost.   For fixed maturities, the
factors considered in reaching the conclusion that a decline below cost is other than temporary include, among others, whether:      

(1) 
 the issuer is in financial distress;        

(2) 
 the investment is secured;        

(3) 
 a significant credit rating action occurred;        

(4) 
 scheduled interest payments were delayed or missed;        

(5) 
 changes in laws or regulations have affected an issuer or industry;        

(6) 
 the investment has an unrealized loss and was identified by the Company s investment manager as an investment to be sold before recovery or maturity; and    

(7) 
 the investment failed cash flow projection testing to determine if anticipated principal and interest payments will be realized.   
 According to accounting guidance for debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company is required to assess whether it has the intent to sell the
debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before the anticipated recovery. If either of these conditions is met the Company must recognize an other than temporary impairment with the entire unrealized loss
being recorded through earnings. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position not meeting these conditions, the Company assesses whether the impairment of a security is other than temporary. If the impairment is deemed to be other
than temporary, the Company must separate the other than temporary impairment into two components: the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors, such as changes in interest rates. The credit loss
represents the portion of the amortized book value in excess of the net present value of the projected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment. The credit loss component of
the other than temporary impairment is recorded through earnings, whereas the amount relating to factors other than credit losses is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of taxes. 
 For equity securities, management carefully reviews all securities with unrealized losses to determine if a security should be impaired and further focuses on
securities that have either:      

(1) 
 persisted with unrealized losses for more than twelve consecutive months or        

(2) 
 the value of the investment has been 20% or more below cost for six continuous months or more.     The amount of
any write-down, including those that are deemed to be other than temporary, is included in earnings as a realized loss in the period in which the impairment arose.  
 The following is a description, by asset type, of the methodology and significant inputs that the Company used to measure the amount of credit loss recognized
in earnings, if any:     Obligations of states and political subdivisions    As of September 30, 2016, gross unrealized losses related to
obligations of states and political subdivisions were $0.049 million. Of this amount, $0.005 million have been in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater and are rated A. All factors that influence performance of the
municipal bond market are considered in evaluating these securities. The aforementioned factors include investor expectations, supply and demand patterns, and current versus historical yield and spread relationships. The analysis relies on the
output of fixed income credit analysts, as well as dedicated municipal bond analysts who perform extensive in-house fundamental analysis on each issuer, regardless of their rating by the major agencies.  
  Mortgage-backed securities ( MBS )    As of September 30, 2016, gross unrealized losses related to mortgage-backed
 
      10  

Table of Contents  

GLOBAL INDEMNITY PLC   

securities were $0.038 million. Of this amount, $0.011 million have been in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater and are rated investment grade. Mortgage-backed
securities are modeled to project principal losses under downside, base, and upside scenarios for the economy and home prices. The primary assumption that drives the security and loan level modeling is the Home Price Index ( HPI )
projection. The model first projects HPI at the national level, then at the zip-code level based on the historical relationship between the individual zip code HPI and the national HPI. The model utilizes loan level data and borrower
characteristics including FICO score, geographic location, original and current loan size, loan age, mortgage rate and type (fixed rate / interest-only / adjustable rate mortgage), issuer / originator, residential type (owner occupied / investor
property), dwelling type (single family / multi-family), loan purpose, level of documentation, and delinquency status as inputs. The model also includes the explicit treatment of silent second liens, utilization of loan modification history,
and the application of roll rate adjustments.    Asset-backed securities ( ABS ) -  As of September 30, 2016, gross unrealized losses related
to asset backed securities were $0.297 million. Of this amount, $0.112 million have been in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater and are rated AA or better. The weighted average credit enhancement for the Company s
asset backed portfolio is 23.3. This represents the percentage of pool losses that can occur before an asset backed security will incur its first dollar of principal losses. Every ABS transaction is analyzed on a stand-alone
basis. This analysis involves a thorough review of the collateral, prepayment, and structural risk in each transaction. Additionally, the analysis includes an in-depth credit analysis of the originator and servicer of the
collateral. The analysis projects an expected loss for a deal given a set of assumptions specific to the asset type. These assumptions are used to calculate at what level of losses the deal will incur its first dollar of principal
loss. The major assumptions used to calculate this ratio are loss severities, recovery lags, and no advances on principal and interest.  
  Commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) -  As of September 30, 2016, gross unrealized losses related to the CMBS portfolio were $1.188
million. Of this amount, $0.617 million have been in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater and are rated A+ or better. The weighted average credit enhancement for the Company s CMBS portfolio is 29.4. This
represents the percentage of pool losses that can occur before a mortgage-backed security will incur its first dollar of principal loss. For the Company s CMBS portfolio, a loan level analysis is utilized where every underlying CMBS loan
is re-underwritten based on a set of assumptions reflecting expectations for the future path of the economy. In the analysis, the focus is centered on stressing the significant variables that influence commercial loan defaults and collateral
losses in CMBS deals. These variables include: (1) a projected drop in occupancies; (2) capitalization rates that vary by property type and are forecasted to return to more normalized levels as the capital markets repair and capital begins to
flow again; and (3) property value stress testing using projected property performance and projected capitalization rates. Term risk is triggered if the projected debt service coverage rate falls below 1x. Balloon risk is triggered if a
property s projected performance does not satisfy new tighter mortgage standards.     Corporate bonds and debt -  As of September 30, 2016, gross
unrealized losses related to corporate bonds was $0.695 million. Of this amount, $0.069 million have been in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater and are rated investment grade. The analysis for this sector includes
maintaining detailed financial models that include a projection of each issuer s future financial performance, including prospective debt servicing capabilities, capital structure composition, and the value of the collateral. The analysis
incorporates the macroeconomic environment, industry conditions in which the issuer operates, the issuer s current competitive position, its vulnerability to changes in the competitive and regulatory environment, issuer liquidity, issuer
commitment to bondholders, issuer creditworthiness, and asset protection. Part of the process also includes running downside scenarios to evaluate the expected likelihood of default as well as potential losses in the event of default.  
  Foreign bonds    As of September 30, 2016, gross unrealized losses related to foreign bonds were $0.028 million. All unrealized losses have been in
an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months. For this sector, detailed financial models are maintained that include a projection of each issuer s future financial performance, including prospective debt servicing capabilities,
capital structure composition, and the value of the collateral. The analysis incorporates the macroeconomic environment, industry conditions in which the issuer operates, the issuer s current competitive position, its vulnerability to
changes in the competitive and regulatory environment, issuer liquidity, issuer commitment to bondholders, issuer creditworthiness, and asset protection. Part of the process also includes running downside scenarios to evaluate the expected
likelihood of default as well as potential losses in the event of default.     Common stock    As of September 30, 2016, gross unrealized losses
related to common stock were $2.345 million. Of this amount, $0.266 million have been in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater. To determine if an other than

temporary impairment of an equity security has occurred, the Company considers, among other things, the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the equity security. The Company
also examines other factors to determine if the equity security could recover its value in a reasonable period of time.    The Company recorded the
following other than temporary impairments ( OTTI ) on its investment portfolio for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:      
   The following table is an analysis of the credit losses recognized in earnings on fixed maturities held by the Company for the

     Net Investment Income    
 The sources of net investment income for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

(1)  
   Investment expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $1.5 million in upfront fees necessary to enter into a new investment. See Note 9 for additional information on the Company s $40
million commitment related to this new investment.      The Company s total investment return on a pre-tax basis for the quarters and nine

   Insurance Enhanced Asset Backed and Credit Securities    
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company held insurance enhanced asset backed and credit securities with a market value of approximately $33.1
million. Approximately $13.7 million of these securities were tax free municipal bonds, which represented approximately 0.9% of the Company s total cash and invested assets, net of payable/receivable for securities purchased and
sold. These securities had an average rating of  A+.  Approximately $5.4 million of these bonds are pre-refunded with U.S. treasury securities, of which $0.5 million are backed by financial guarantors, meaning that funds have
been set aside in escrow to satisfy the future interest and principal obligations of the bond. Of the remaining $8.3 million of tax free insurance enhanced municipal bonds, $0.5 million would have carried a lower credit rating had they not been
insured. The following table provides a breakdown of the ratings for these municipal bonds with and without insurance.

A summary of the Company s insurance enhanced municipal bonds that are backed by financial guarantors, including the
pre-refunded bonds that are escrowed in U.S. government obligations, as of September 30, 2016, is as follows:      
   In addition to the tax-free municipal bonds, the Company held $19.4 million of insurance enhanced bonds that are comprised of
$18.3 million of taxable municipal bonds and $1.1 million of asset-backed securities, which represented approximately 1.3% of the Company s total invested assets, net of receivable/payable for securities purchased and sold. The financial
guarantors of the Company s $19.4 million of insurance enhanced asset-backed and taxable municipal securities include Municipal Bond Insurance Association ($3.8 million), Ambac Financial Group ($0.9 million), Assured Guaranty Corporation ($14.6
million), and Financial Guaranty Insurance Group ($0.1 million).    The Company had no direct investments in the entities that have provided financial
guarantees or other credit support to any security held by the Company at September 30, 2016.      Bonds Held on Deposit    
 Certain cash balances, cash equivalents, equity securities, and bonds available for sale were deposited with various governmental authorities in accordance
with statutory requirements, were held as collateral pursuant to borrowing arrangements, or were held in trust pursuant to intercompany reinsurance agreements. The fair values were as follows as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

(1)  
   Amount required to collateralize margin borrowing facilities.        Variable Interest Entities
     A Variable Interest Entity (VIE) refers to an investment in which an investor holds a controlling interest that is not based on the majority of
voting rights. Under the VIE model, the party that has the power to exercise significant management  
      17  

Table of Contents  

GLOBAL INDEMNITY PLC   

influence and maintain a controlling financial interest in the entity s economics is said to be the primary beneficiary, and is required to consolidate the entity within their results. Other
entities that participate in a VIE, for which their financial interests fluctuate with changes in the fair value of the investment entity s net assets but do not have significant management influence and the ability to direct the VIE s
significant economic activities are said to have a variable interest in the VIE but do not consolidate the VIE in their financial results.    The Company
has variable interests in several VIE s for which it is not the primary beneficiary. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as their ownership interest exceeds 3% of their respective
investments.        The fair value of one of the Company s variable interest VIE s was $29.1 million and $32.6 million as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company s maximum exposure to loss from this variable interest VIE, which factors in future funding commitments, was $51.1 million at September 30, 2016 and $52.6 million at December
31, 2015. The fair value of the remaining three variable interest VIE s, which were acquired in 2016, were $3.6 million at September 30, 2016. The Company is not able to accurately estimate future funding requirements for the remaining three
variable interest VIE s due to related debt components of the underlying investments that are not considered variable interest VIE s. If the entire future funding commitments of these three investments were considered variable interest
VIE s, the Company s maximum exposure to loss from the remaining VIE s at September 30, 2016 would be $24.6 million. The Company s investment in variable interest VIE s is included in other invested assets on the
consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations.      

3.  
  Derivative Instruments       Interest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce risks from
changes in interest rates. Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts as calculated by reference to
an agreed notional amount.    The Company accounts for the interest rate swaps as non-hedge instruments and recognizes the fair value of the interest rate
swaps in other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with the changes in fair value recognized as net realized investment gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company is ultimately responsible
for the valuation of the interest rate swaps. To aid in determining the estimated fair value of the interest rate swaps, the Company relies on the forward interest rate curve and information obtained from a third party financial
institution.   The following table summarizes information on the location and the gross amount of the derivatives  fair value on the consolidated
balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:      
   The following table summarizes the net gains (losses) included in the consolidated statement of operations for changes in the
fair value of the derivatives and the periodic net interest settlements under the derivatives for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:     
   As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company is due $4.4 million and $4.5 million, respectively, for funds it
needed to post to execute the swap transaction and $25.2 million and $17.3 million, respectively, for margin calls made in connection with the interest rate swaps. These amounts are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

  Fair Value Measurements       The accounting standards related to fair value measurements define fair value,
establish a framework for measuring fair value, outline a fair value hierarchy based on inputs used to measure fair value, and enhance disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. These standards do not change existing guidance as to
whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. The Company has determined that its fair value measurements are in accordance with the requirements of these accounting standards.  
 The Company s invested assets and derivative instruments are carried at their fair value and are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy:  

Level 1 - inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.   

Level 2 - inputs utilize other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for similar assets, either directly or indirectly.   

Level 3 - inputs are unobservable for the asset, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset.    
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair
value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a
particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset.    The following table
presents information about the Company s invested assets and derivative instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques
utilized by the Company to determine such fair value.

(1) 
 Excluded from the table above are limited partnerships of $32.6 million at December 31, 2015 whose fair value is based on net asset value as a practical expedient.    
 The securities classified as Level 1 in the above table consist of U.S. Treasuries and equity securities actively traded on an exchange.  
 The securities classified as Level 2 in the above table consist primarily of fixed maturity securities and derivative instruments. Based on the typical
trading volumes and the lack of quoted market prices for fixed maturities, security prices are derived through recent reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market
observable information. If there are no recent reported trades, matrix or model processes are used to develop a security price where future cash flow expectations are developed based upon collateral performance and discounted at an estimated
market rate. Included in the pricing of asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and mortgage-backed securities are estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the
securities. Such estimates are derived based on the characteristics of the underlying structure and prepayment speeds previously experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral. The estimated fair value of
the interest rate swaps is obtained from a third party financial institution who utilizes observable inputs such as the forward interest rate curve.    For
the Company s material debt arrangements, the current fair value of the Company s debt at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was as follows:      

The fair value of the margin borrowing facilities approximates its carrying value due to the facilities being due on demand. The 7.75% subordinated notes
due 2045 are publicly traded instruments and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.    There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2
during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

  The following table presents changes in Level 3 investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for
the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:      
   The investments classified as Level 3 in the above table consist of privately placed securities with unobservable
inputs. The Company does not have access to daily valuations; therefore, market trades, performance of the underlying assets, and key risks are considered in order to estimate fair values of these middle market corporate debt instruments.  
   Fair Value of Alternative Investments      Other
invested assets consist of limited liability companies and limited partnerships whose fair value is based on the net asset value per share practical expedient. The following table provides the fair value and future funding commitments related
to these investments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.      

(1)   
     This limited partnership invests in real estate assets through a combination of direct or indirect investments in partnerships, limited liability companies, mortgage loans, and lines of credit. The
Company does not have the contractual option to redeem its limited partnership interest but receives distributions based on the liquidation of the underlying assets. The Company does not have the ability to sell or transfer its limited
partnership interest without consent from the general partner. The Company continues to hold an investment in this limited partnership and has written the fair value down to zero.    

(2)  
   This limited partnership invests in distressed securities and assets through senior and subordinated, secured and unsecured debt and equity, in both public and private large-cap and middle-market
companies. The Company does not have the ability to sell or transfer its limited partnership interest without consent from the general partner. The Company does not have the contractual option to redeem its limited partnership interest but
receives distributions based on the liquidation of the underlying assets. Based on the terms of the partnership agreement, the Company anticipates its interest in this partnership to be redeemed in 2020.    

(3)  
   This interest consists of three separate equity investments in limited liability companies whereby the Company is also a lender via separate loan agreements. Typical financing is used for growth, acquisitions, or
buyouts. The Company classifies their portion of the middle market corporate debt as fixed maturities. The Company has committed $40 million to this investment strategy, including both the equity and financing provisions. While the
Company is not able to estimate the proportion of future funding commitments between equity and financing, the total remaining commitment is $21.1 million. Based on the terms of the investment management agreement, the Company anticipates its
interest to be redeemed no later than 2024.        Limited Liability Companies and Limited Partnerships with ownership interest exceeding 3%
     The Company uses the equity method to account for investments in limited liability companies and limited partnerships where its ownership interest
exceeds 3%. The equity method of accounting for an investment in a limited liability company and limited partnership requires that its cost basis be updated to account for the income or loss earned on the investment. The investment income associated
with these limited liability companies or limited partnerships, which is reflected in the statement of operations, was $0.9 million and $0.1 million during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $3.7 million and $1.4
million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

    Pricing    
 The Company s pricing vendors provide prices for all investment categories except for investments in limited liability companies and limited partnerships
whose fair value is based on net asset values as a practical expedient. Two vendors provide prices for equity and fixed maturity securities.   The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used by the Company s pricing vendors for investment securities carried at fair value:      

Common stock prices are received from all primary and secondary exchanges.        

Corporate and agency bonds are evaluated by utilizing a multi-dimensional relational model. For bonds with early redemption options, an option adjusted spread model is utilized. Both asset classes use standard
inputs and incorporate security set up, defined sector breakdown, benchmark yields, apply base spreads, yield to maturity, and adjust for corporate actions.        

Data from commercial vendors is aggregated with market information, then converted into a prepayment/spread/LIBOR curve model used for commercial mortgage obligations ( CMO ). CMOs are categorized with
mortgage-backed securities in the tables listed above. For asset-backed securities, data derived from market information along with trustee and servicer reports is converted into spreads to interpolated swap yield curve. For both asset
classes, evaluations utilize standard inputs plus new issue data, monthly payment information, and collateral performance. The evaluated pricing models incorporate discount rates, loan level information, prepayment speeds, treasury benchmarks,
and LIBOR and swap curves.        

For obligations of state and political subdivisions, a multi-dimensional relational model is used to evaluate securities. The pricing models incorporate security set-up, benchmark yields, apply base spreads, yield
to worst or market convention, ratings updates, prepayment schedules and adjustments for material events notices.        

U.S. treasuries are evaluated by obtaining feeds from a number of live data sources including active market makers and inter-dealer brokers.        

For mortgage-backed securities, a matrix model correlation to TBA (a forward MBS trade) or benchmarking is utilized to value a security.    
 The Company performs certain procedures to validate whether the pricing information received from the pricing vendors is reasonable, to ensure that the fair
value determination is consistent with accounting guidance, and to ensure that its assets are properly classified in the fair value hierarchy. The Company s procedures include, but are not limited to:  

Reviewing periodic reports provided by the Investment Manager that provides information regarding rating changes and securities placed on watch. This procedure allows the Company to understand why a particular
security s market value may have changed or may potentially change.        

Understanding and periodically evaluating the various pricing methods and procedures used by the Company s pricing vendors to ensure that investments are properly classified within the fair value hierarchy.

On a quarterly basis, the Company corroborates investment security prices received from its pricing vendors by obtaining pricing from a second pricing vendor for a sample of securities.    
 During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not adjusted quotes or prices obtained from the pricing vendors.

  Income Taxes       The statutory income tax rates of the countries where the Company does business are 35% in
the United States, 0% in Bermuda, 0% in the Cayman Islands, 0% in Gibraltar, 29.22% in the Duchy of Luxembourg, and 25% on non-trading income, 33% on capital gains and 12.5% on trading income in the Republic of Ireland. The statutory income tax
rate of each

GLOBAL INDEMNITY PLC   

country is applied against the expected annual taxable income of the Company in each country to estimate the annual income tax expense. Generally, during interim periods, the Company will
divide total estimated annual income tax expense by total estimated annual pre-tax income to determine the expected annual income tax rate used to compute the income tax provision. The expected annual income tax rate is then applied against
interim pre-tax income, excluding net realized gains and losses and distributions from limited liability companies and limited partnerships, and that amount is then added to the actual income taxes on net realized gains and losses, discrete items
and distributions from limited liability companies and limited partnerships. However, when there is significant volatility in the expected effective tax rate, the Company records its actual income tax provision in lieu of the estimated
effective income tax rate.    The Company s income before income taxes from its non-U.S. subsidiaries and U.S. subsidiaries, including the results of
the quota share and stop-loss agreements between Global Indemnity Reinsurance and the Insurance Operations, for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

  The following table summarizes the differences between the tax provision for financial statement purposes and
the expected tax provision at the weighted average tax rate:      
   The effective income tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was 10.0%, compared to an effective income tax benefit
rate of 61.5% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily due to capital gains and the gain on the sale of United National Specialty Insurance Company during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Taxes were computed
using a discrete period computation because a reliable estimate of an effective tax rate could not be made.     
   The effective income tax benefit rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 961.4%, compared to an effective income
tax benefit rate of 331.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily due to losses incurred in the Company s U.S. operations. Taxes were computed using a discrete period computation because a reliable
estimate of an effective tax rate could not be made.   The Company has an alternative minimum tax ( AMT ) credit carryforward of $11.0 million and
$10.9 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has a net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforward of $10.1 million and $1.9 million as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, which will expire in 2036 and 2035, respectively. The Company has a Section 163(j) ( 163(j) ) carryforward of $3.9 million and $3.1 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
which can be carried forward indefinitely. The 163(j) carryforward is for disqualified interest paid or accrued to a related entity that is not subject to U.S. tax.

  Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses       Activity in the liability for unpaid losses
and loss adjustment expenses is summarized as follows:      
   When analyzing loss reserves and prior year development, the Company considers many factors, including the frequency and
severity of claims, loss trends, case reserve settlements that may have resulted in significant development, and any other additional or pertinent factors that may impact reserve estimates.  
 In the third quarter of 2016, the Company reduced its prior accident year loss reserves by $9.4 million, which consisted of a $6.5 million decrease related to
Commercial Lines and a $2.9 million decrease related to Reinsurance Operations.    The $6.5 million reduction of prior accident year loss reserves related
to Commercial Lines primarily consisted of the following:      

General Liability:  A $9.0 million reduction in aggregate with $3.2 million of favorable development in the construction defect reserve category and $6.0 million of favorable development in the other general
liability reserve categories. The favorable development in the construction defect reserve category reflects the lower than expected claims frequency and severity which led to a reduction in the 2005 through 2015 accident years. For the
other general liability reserve categories, lower than anticipated claims severity was the driver of the favorable development mainly in accident years 2004 through 2012.    

Property:  A $2.1 million increase was due to higher than expected case incurred emergence in the property brokerage segment excluding catastrophe experience in the 2011 through 2015 accident years.
     The $2.9 million reduction related to Reinsurance Operations was from the property lines. Ultimate losses were lowered in the 2014 and
2015 accident years based on a review of the experience reported from cedants.    In the third quarter of 2015, the Company decreased its prior accident
year loss reserves by $8.5 million, which consisted of a $7.3 million decrease related to Commercial Lines and a $1.2 million decrease related to Reinsurance Operations.  
 The $7.3 million decrease related to Commercial Lines primarily consisted of the following:  

Professional:  A $3.5 million decrease in aggregate primarily related to better than anticipated loss emergence in accident years 2006 through 2012.    

General Liability:  A $3.8 million decrease in aggregate primarily related to accident years 1999 through 2013 primarily due to better than anticipated frequency and severity in construction defect.
   
      26  

Table of Contents  

GLOBAL INDEMNITY PLC   
   
  The $1.2 million decrease in aggregate related to Reinsurance Operations was primarily due to lower than
expected emergence on property catastrophe contracts for accident years 2009 to 2013.    In the first nine months of 2016, the Company decreased its prior
accident year loss reserves by $24.9 million, which consisted of an $18.8 million decrease related to Commercial Lines and a $6.1 million decrease related to Reinsurance Operations.  
 The $18.8 million decrease related to Commercial Lines primarily consisted of the following:  

General Liability:  A $21.1 million reduction in aggregate with $4.8 million of favorable development in the construction defect reserve category and $16.3 million of favorable development in the other general
liability reserve categories. The favorable development in the construction defect reserve category reflects the lower than expected claims frequency and severity which led to a reduction in the 2005 through 2015 accident years. For the
other general liability reserve categories, lower than anticipated claims severity was the driver of the favorable development mainly in accident years 2004 through 2012.    

Property:  A $0.8 million increase in aggregate with a $0.5 million increase in the non-catastrophe segments and a $0.3 million increase in the catastrophe segments. The increases reflect higher than expected
case incurred emergence primarily in the 2012 through 2015 accident years.      The $6.1 million reduction related to Reinsurance Operations was
from the property lines. Ultimate losses were lowered for the 2013 through 2015 accident years due to lower than expected emergence of catastrophe losses.  
 In the first nine months of 2015, the Company decreased its prior accident year loss reserves by $17.2 million, which consisted of a $12.9 million decrease
related to Commercial Lines and a $4.3 million decrease related to Reinsurance Operations.    The $12.9 million decrease related to Commercial Lines
primarily consisted of the following:      

Property:  A $0.8 million decrease in aggregate primary related to better than anticipated loss emergence in the 2011 through 2014 accident years.    

Umbrella:  $0.3 million decrease primarily related to accident years 2003 through 2005 as a result of better than anticipated loss emergence.    

Professional:  $6.4 million decrease in aggregate primarily related to better than anticipated frequency in accident years 2006 through 2012.    

General Liability:  A $5.7 million decrease in aggregate primarily related to accident years prior to 2013 due to better than anticipated frequency and severity in construction defect.    
 The $4.3 million decrease in aggregate related to Reinsurance Operations was primarily due to improved results reported by the Company s cedants on
property contracts for accident years 2009 through 2014.

  Commitments and Contingencies         Legal Proceedings    
 The Company is, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The Company maintains insurance and
reinsurance coverage for such risks in amounts that it considers adequate. However, there can be no assurance that the insurance and reinsurance coverage that the Company maintains is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a
reasonable cost. The Company does not believe that the resolution of any currently pending legal proceedings, either individually or taken as a whole, will have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, cash flows, or
financial condition.   There is a greater potential for disputes with reinsurers who are in runoff. Some of the Company s reinsurers  have
operations that are in runoff, and therefore, the Company closely monitors those relationships. The Company anticipates that, similar to the rest of the insurance and reinsurance industry, it will continue to be subject to litigation and
arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of business.      Commitments    
 During 2014, the Company entered into a $50 million commitment to purchase an alternative investment vehicle which is comprised of European non-performing
loans. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has funded $28.0 million of this commitment leaving $22.0 million as unfunded.   In June, 2016, the
Company entered into a $40 million commitment with an investment manager that provides financing for middle market companies. Typical financing arrangements are used for growth, acquisitions, or buyouts. This investment vehicle targets
companies with $10 - $50 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has funded $18.9 million of this commitment leaving $21.1 million as unfunded. Of the $18.9 million
funded, $16.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively, was invested in middle market corporate debt and three separate equity investments in limited liability companies.

follows:      
   If the Company had not incurred a loss in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, 25,704,931 weighted average shares would have
been used to compute the diluted loss per share calculation. In addition to the basic shares, weighted average shares for the diluted calculation would have included 138,261 shares of non-vested restricted stock and 102,676 share equivalents
for options.    The weighted average shares outstanding used to determine dilutive earnings per share for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 do

  New Accounting Pronouncements       The following are new accounting guidance issued in 2016 which have not
yet been adopted.    In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new accounting guidance regarding the classification
of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows. The new guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. This guidance is effective for
public business entities for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Although the Company is still evaluating the impact of this new guidance, the
Company does not anticipate it will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.    In June, 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new accounting guidance surrounding the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. For assets held at amortized cost basis, the new guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment
methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of information for credit loss estimates. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured
similar to current GAAP; however, the new guidance requires that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of this new guidance is permitted as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is still
evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.    In March, 2016, the FASB issued new accounting
guidance surrounding stock compensation. The new guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. Although the Company is
still evaluating the impact of this new guidance, the Company does not anticipate it will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

  In February, 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance regarding leases. The new guidance increases
transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for public business entities for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Although the Company is still evaluating the impact of this new guidance, the Company does not anticipate it
will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.    In January, 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance
surrounding the accounting for financial instruments. The new guidance addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. In particular, the guidance requires equity investments,
except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee, to be measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in net income. It also simplifies the impairment
assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of this new guidance is permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows.    In 2016, the FASB issued several new accounting pronouncements which provided clarification to existing
guidance surrounding revenue from contracts with customers. Long and short duration insurance contracts, which comprise the majority of the Company s revenues, are excluded from this accounting guidance. This guidance is effective for
public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Although the Company is still evaluating the impact of this new guidance, the Company does not anticipate it will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flows.       Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
    The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Global Indemnity included elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with
respect to the Company s plans and strategy, constitutes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  at the end of this Item 2 for a
discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein. For more information regarding the Company s business and
operations, please see the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.     Recent Developments   
 On September 30, 2016, Diamond State Insurance Company sold all the outstanding shares of capital stock of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, United
National Specialty Insurance Company, to an unrelated party. Diamond State Insurance Company received a one-time payment of $18.7 million and recognized a pretax gain of $6.9 million which is reflected in other income (loss). This
transaction will not have an impact on the Company s ongoing business operations. Going forward, any business previously written by United National Specialty Insurance Company has been and will be written by other companies within the
Company s U.S. Insurance Operations.   James W. Crystal and Larry N. Port resigned from the Company s Board of Directors effective July 24, 2016
and July 28, 2016, respectively.   On June 20, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved a plan to re-domicile from
Ireland to the Cayman Islands. On September 14, 2016, the Company held a special meeting of the holders of its A ordinary shares and B ordinary shares and an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders. The proposals submitted to a vote
of the shareholders at the meetings are described in detail in the Company s proxy statement filed on July 15, 2016. All resolutions required to effectuate the re-domestication were approved by the requisite shareholder vote. On
October 21,

2016, the High Court of Ireland sanctioned Global Indemnity plc s scheme of arrangement related to the re-domestication from Ireland to Cayman Islands. A Cayman Islands exempted
company, Global Indemnity Limited, will replace Global Indemnity plc as the ultimate holding company of the Global Indemnity group of companies. The Company does not expect the re-domestication will have any material impact on its financial
results, including the Company s global effective tax rate. The Company expects to complete the re-domestication during the week of November 7, 2016.  
 The Company believes that the Cayman Islands offers a business friendly regulatory environment and a predictable legal framework that simultaneously provides
both corporate certainty and shareholder protections, presents a flexible and stable legal and corporate governance framework, which allows a company s Board of Directors latitude to exercise its judgment in what it deems to be in the best
interests of the company and offers a beneficial tax regime.    Upon implementation of the move to the Cayman Islands, each Company A ordinary share
will be cancelled and replaced with one A ordinary share of Global Indemnity Limited and each Company B ordinary share will be cancelled and replaced with one B ordinary share of Global Indemnity Limited. The Company intends that the Global
Indemnity Limited A ordinary shares will trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ( NASDAQ ) under the ticker symbol GBLI, the same symbol under which the Company s A ordinary shares are currently listed. The Company intends that
Global Indemnity Limited will be subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements, the mandates of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the corporate governance rules of NASDAQ. The Company will report its consolidated financial
results in U.S. dollars and under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.    For additional information on the proposed re-domestication, see the
Company s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on July 15, 2016.    In June, 2016, the Company entered into a $40 million
commitment with an investment manager that provides financing for middle market companies. Typical financing arrangements are used for growth, acquisitions, or buyouts. This investment vehicle targets companies with $10 - $50 million in
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has funded $18.9 million of this commitment leaving $21.1 million as unfunded. Of the $18.9 million funded, $16.3 million and $2.6
million, respectively, was invested in middle market corporate debt and three separate equity investments in limited liability companies. 
  Overview     The Company s Commercial
Lines segment distribute property and casualty insurance products through a group of approximately 120 professional general agencies that have limited quoting and binding authority, as well as a number of wholesale insurance brokers who in turn sell
the Company s insurance products to insureds through retail insurance brokers. Commercial Lines operates predominantly in the excess and surplus lines marketplace. The Company manages its Commercial Lines segment via product
classifications. These product classifications are: 1) Penn-America, which includes property and general liability products for small commercial businesses distributed through a select network of wholesale general agents with specific binding
authority; 2) United National, which includes property, general liability, and professional lines products distributed through program administrators with specific binding authority; and 3) Diamond State, which includes property, casualty, and
professional lines products distributed through wholesale brokers and program administrators with specific binding authority.   The Company s Personal
Lines segment, via American Reliable, offers specialty personal lines and agricultural coverage through a group of approximately 285 agents, primarily comprised of wholesale general agents, with specific binding authority in the admitted
marketplace.    The Company s Reinsurance Operations consisting solely of the operations of Global Indemnity Reinsurance, provides
reinsurance solutions through brokers and on a direct basis. Global Indemnity Reinsurance is a Bermuda based treaty reinsurer for specialty property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies. Global Indemnity Reinsurance conducts
business in Bermuda and is focused on using its capital capacity to write catastrophe-oriented placements and other niche or specialty-focused treaties meeting the Company s risk tolerance and return thresholds. 
 The Company derives its revenues primarily from premiums paid on insurance policies that it writes and from income generated by its investment portfolio, net
of fees paid for investment management services. The amount of insurance premiums that the Company receives is a function of the amount and type of policies it writes, as well as prevailing market prices.

  The Company s expenses include losses and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs and other
underwriting expenses, corporate and other operating expenses, interest, investment expenses, and income taxes. Losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated by management and reflect the Company s best estimate of ultimate losses and
costs arising during the reporting period and revisions of prior period estimates. The Company records its best estimate of losses and loss adjustment expenses considering both internal and external actuarial analyses of the estimated losses
the Company expects to incur on the insurance policies it writes. The ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses will depend on the actual costs to resolve claims. Acquisition costs consist principally of commissions and premium taxes
that are typically a percentage of the premiums on the insurance policies the Company writes, net of ceding commissions earned from reinsurers. Other underwriting expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and general operating expenses
related to underwriting activities. Corporate and other operating expenses are comprised primarily of outside legal fees, other professional and accounting fees, directors  fees, management fees and salaries and benefits for company
personnel whose services relate to the support of corporate activities. Interest expense is primarily comprised of amounts due on outstanding debt.  
  Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies   
 The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which require it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 
 The most critical accounting policies involve significant estimates and include those used in determining the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment
expenses, recoverability of reinsurance receivables, investments, fair value measurements, goodwill and intangible assets, deferred acquisition costs, and taxation. For a detailed discussion on each of these policies, please see the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no significant changes to any of these policies during the current year.

    Premiums    
 The following table summarizes the change in premium volume by business segment:      

(1) 
 Gross premiums written represent the amount received or to be received for insurance policies written without reduction for reinsurance costs or other deductions.    

(2) 
 Net premiums written equal gross premiums written less ceded premiums written    

(4) 
 Includes business ceded to the Company s Reinsurance Operations.    

(5) 
 External business only, excluding business assumed from affiliates.      Gross premiums written decreased by 11.0%
and 6.6% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to same periods in 2015. Gross premiums written include business written by American Reliable that is ceded to insurance entities owned by Assurant under a
100% quota share reinsurance agreement in the amount of $7.3 million and $18.7 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $30.9 million and $41.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Excluding the business that is ceded 100% to insurance entities owned by Assurant, gross premiums written decreased by 3.9% and 4.7% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to same
periods in 2015. The decline is mainly due to one of the treaties within the Reinsurance Operations being non-renewed in 2016 in an effort to reduce catastrophe exposure. In addition, there was some slight reduction of premiums within both
Commercial Lines and Personal Line primarily due to non-renewing unprofitable business and limiting catastrophe exposure in certain areas.

The net premium retention for the Personal Lines segment for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 2.5 points and 7.1 points,
respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. The reduction in the Personal Lines  retention rate for the quarter was primarily due to the quota share arrangement that was put in place during the second quarter of 2016. The
reduction in the Personal Lines  retention rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in catastrophe reinsurance as well as the quota share arrangement that was put in place during the second quarter of
2016.    The net premium retention for the Commercial Lines segment for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 2.1 points and 2.4
points, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to ceding more premiums in an effort to reduce exposure to catastrophes and large losses.      
   Net Premiums earned      Net premiums earned within
the Personal Lines segment decreased by 2.1% and 4.1% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. Property net premiums earned were $50.6 million and $52.7 million for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $153.8 million and $164.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Casualty net premiums earned were $10.2 million and $9.4 million for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $29.8 million and $27.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Net premiums earned within the Commercial Lines segment decreased by 1.5% and 3.7% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as
compared to the same period in 2015. The decline in net premiums earned was primarily due to decreasing the Company s property retention, additional property excess of loss reinsurance was purchased, and a slight reduction in gross
premiums written. Property net premiums earned were $27.4 million and $28.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $82.9 million and $89.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Casualty net premiums earned were $20.8 million and $20.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $60.8 million and $59.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.   Net premiums earned within the Reinsurance Operations segment decreased by 22.7% and 21.2% for the quarter and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. The decline in net premiums earned was primarily due to one treaty being non-renewed in 2016 in an effort to reduce catastrophe exposure. Property net premiums earned were
$9.5 million and $12.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $28.9 million and $38.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Casualty net premiums earned were $1.0
million and $1.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $2.8 million and $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

    Reserves    
 Management s best estimate at September 30, 2016 was recorded as the loss reserve. Management s best estimate is as of a particular point in
time and is based upon known facts, the Company s actuarial analyses, current law, and the Company s judgment. This resulted in carried gross and net reserves of $664.4 million and $561.6 million, respectively, as of September 30,
2016. A breakout of the Company s gross and net reserves, excluding the effects of the Company s intercompany pooling arrangements and intercompany stop loss and quota share reinsurance agreements, as of September 30, 2016 is as
follows:      

(1)  
   Losses incurred but not reported, including the expected future emergence of case reserves.    

(2)  
   Does not include reinsurance receivable on paid losses.      Each reserve category has an implicit
frequency and severity for each accident year as a result of the various assumptions made. If the actual levels of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate losses will be different than management s best
estimate. For most of its reserve categories, the Company believes that frequency can be predicted with greater accuracy than severity. Therefore, the Company believes management s best estimate is more likely influenced by changes in
severity than frequency. The following table, which the Company believes reflects a reasonable range of variability around its best estimate based on historical loss experience and management s judgment, reflects the impact of changes
(which could be favorable or unfavorable) in frequency and severity on the Company s current accident year net loss estimate of $240.0 million for claims occurring during the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  
   
   The Company s net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses of $561.6 million as of September 30, 2016 relate to
multiple accident years. Therefore, the impact of changes in frequency and severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above.

    Loss Ratio    
 The current accident year losses and loss ratio is summarized as follows:      
   The current accident year catastrophe loss ratio improved by 6.9 points during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to same period in 2015 primarily due to the third quarter of 2015 being adversely impacted by the California wild fires which led to a much higher case incurred loss ratio in 2015 as compared to the current accident quarter at three months
of development. While the quarter to date shows an improvement of 6.9 points, the nine months ended September 30, 2016 only improved by 0.2 points compared to the same period in 2015. This is mainly due to higher losses from convective
storms in 2016 as opposed to 2015.   For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no changes to net prior accident
year losses.      Expense Ratios      The expense
ratio for the Company s Personal Lines improved by 0.2 points from 41.5% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to 41.3% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The previous year s expense ratio benefitted from a 1.7 point
reduction due to the impact of accounting adjustments related to the purchase of American Reliable in 2015. The improvement in the expense ratio is due to efficiencies realized from the integration of American Reliable into the Company s
U.S. Insurance Operations.    The expense ratio increased 3.7 points from 39.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 42.7% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the reduction in earned premiums in 2016 as a result of the quota share arrangement and the 2015 expense ratio benefitting from accounting adjustments related to the purchase of American Reliable.

    Loss Ratio    
 The current accident year losses and loss ratio is summarized as follows:      
   The current accident year catastrophe loss ratio increased by 7.7 points and 4.2 point during the quarter and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to higher losses from convective storms in 2016 as opposed to 2015. 
 The current accident year non-catastrophe property loss ratio improved by 6.3 points during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same
period in 2015.    The third quarter of 2015 was adversely impacted by one large hotel fire loss in Florida. The decrease in the loss ratio also reflects a lower frequency and severity in the latest accident quarter compared to
the same quarter last year.    The current accident year non-catastrophe property loss ratio increased by 6.3 points during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 which is mainly attributable to an increase in large property losses.   The current accident year casualty
loss ratio improved by 5.9 points during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 mainly due to the decrease in reported claim frequency which reflects the milder winter weather experienced during
2016. Also, underwriting actions and rate increases over the past several years have contributed to the improvement experienced to date.    The
calendar year loss ratio for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes a decrease of $6.5 million, or 13.5 percentage points, and a decrease of $18.9 million, or 13.1 percentage points, respectively, related to reserve
development on prior accident years. The calendar year loss ratio for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes a decrease of $7.3 million, or 14.9 percentage points and a decrease of $12.9 million, or 8.7 percentage points,
respectively, related to reserve development on prior accident years. Please see Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion on prior accident year development.  
   Expense Ratios      The expense ratio for the
Company s Commercial Lines improved by 2.1 points from 42.3% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to 40.2% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The expense ratio improved 0.2 points from 41.1% for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 to 40.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The improvement in the expense ratio is primarily due to efficiencies realized from integration of American Reliable into the Company s U.S. Insurance Operations.

    Loss Ratio    
 The current accident year loss ratio increased by 26.0 points and 16.1 points during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively. This increase was mainly attributable to higher than expected case incurred emergence primarily from the Fort McMurray fires in 2016.  
 The calendar year loss ratio for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes a decrease of $2.9 million, or 27.4 percentage points, and a
decrease of $6.1 million, or 19.2 percentage points, respectively, related to reserve development on prior accident years. The calendar year loss ratio for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes a decrease of $1.2
million, or 8.8 percentage points and a decrease of $4.3 million, or 10.6 percentage points, respectively, related to reserve development on prior accident years. Please see Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1
of Part I of this report for further discussion on prior accident year development.      Expense Ratio    
 The expense ratio for the Company s Reinsurance Operations increased by 2.1 points from 32.7% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to 34.8% for
the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The expense ratio increased 1.4 points from 35.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 36.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is primarily due to improvements in
prior year losses resulting in higher contingent commissions due as well as a reduction in earned premiums.      Unallocated Corporate Items
       Net Investment Income        

(1)  
   Excludes realized gains and losses      Gross investment income increased by 1.9% and 2.0% for the quarter
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase was primarily due to the increase in income related to the Company s limited partnership investments during 2016 partially offset
by a reduction in the size of the investment portfolio due to redeeming $190.0 million of A ordinary shares during the fourth quarter of 2015.    Investment
expenses increased by 31.8% and 68.4% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase is mainly attributable to higher investment fees related to a new investment in
middle market corporate debt and equity investments in limited liability companies. See Note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report for additional information on the Company s $40 million
commitment related to this new investment.    At September 30, 2016, the Company held agency mortgage-backed securities with a market value of $76.1
million. Excluding the agency mortgage-backed securities, the average duration of the Company s fixed maturities portfolio was 2.0 years as of September 30, 2016, compared with 2.1 years as of September 30, 2015. Including cash and
short-term investments, the average duration of the Company s fixed maturities portfolio, excluding agency mortgage-backed securities, was 1.9 years as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Changes in interest rates can cause
principal payments on certain investments to extend or shorten which can impact duration. At September 30, 2016, the Company s embedded book yield on its fixed maturities, not including cash, was 2.2% compared with 2.1% at September 30,
2015. The embedded book yield on the $170.7 million of municipal bonds in the Company s portfolio, which includes $105.9 million of taxable municipal bonds, was 2.8% at September 30, 2016, compared to an embedded book yield of 2.7% on the
Company s municipal bond portfolio of $235.4 million at September 30, 2015.

 The components of net realized investment gains (losses) for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  
   
   See Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report for an analysis of total
investment return on a pre-tax basis for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      Corporate and Other Operating Expenses
     Corporate and other operating expenses consist of outside legal fees, other professional fees, directors  fees, management fees, salaries and
benefits for holding company personnel, development costs for new products, and taxes incurred which are not directly related to operations. Corporate and other operating expenses were $5.0 million and $3.6 during the quarters ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This increase is primarily due to cost incurred in connection with the re-domestication of $1.2 million in 2016. Corporate and other operating expenses were $13.1 million and $19.4 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This decrease is primarily due to 2015 including cost incurred in connection with the American Reliable acquisition of $8.3 million; whereas, 2016 included cost incurred in connection with
the re-domestication of $2.8 million.      Interest Expense    
 Interest expense increased 40.0% and 153.4% during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015. This
increase is primarily due to the Company s $100 million debt offering in August 2015 offset by a reduction in interest expense on margin borrowing facility due to decreased borrowings. See Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for details on the Company s debt.      Income Tax Benefit
     The income tax expense was $1.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with income tax benefit of $6.0 million for the quarter
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to capital gains and the gain on the sale of United National Specialty Insurance Company during the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
 The income tax benefit was $10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with income tax benefit of $10.9 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2015.   See Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report for a comparison of income tax
between periods.      Net Income (Loss)      The
factors described above resulted in a net income of $9.5 million and a net loss of $3.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net income of $11.5 million and $14.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   Sources and Uses of Funds      Global Indemnity is a
holding company. Its principal asset is its ownership of the shares of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including those of its U.S. insurance companies: United National Insurance Company, Diamond State Insurance Company, Penn-America
Insurance Company, Penn-Star Insurance Company, Penn-Patriot Insurance Company, and American Reliable Insurance Company; and its Reinsurance Operations: Global Indemnity Reinsurance.  
 The principal sources of cash that Global Indemnity requires to meet its short term and long term liquidity needs, including the payment of corporate
expenses, debt service payments, and share repurchases includes dividends, other permitted disbursements from its direct and indirect subsidiaries, reimbursement for equity awards granted to employees and intercompany borrowings. The principal
sources of funds at these direct and indirect subsidiaries include underwriting operations, investment income, and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments. Funds are used principally by these operating subsidiaries to pay claims and
operating expenses, to make debt payments, fund margin requirements on interest rate swap agreements, to purchase investments, and to make dividend payments. The future liquidity of Global Indemnity is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to
pay dividends. On October 29, 2015, Global Indemnity acquired rights, expiring December 31, 2019, to redeem an additional 3,397,031 ordinary shares for $78.1 million, which is subject to an annual 3% increase. In addition, the Company
has future funding commitments of $43.1 million related to investments. The timing of this commitment is uncertain. Other than the impact of this potential redemption and the Company s future funding commitments related to
investments, Global Indemnity has no commitments that could have a material impact on its short-term or long-term liquidity needs.    Global
Indemnity s U.S. insurance companies are restricted by statute as to the amount of dividends that they may pay without the prior approval of regulatory authorities. The dividend limitations imposed by state laws are based on the statutory
financial results of each insurance company within the Insurance Operations that are determined by using statutory accounting practices that differ in various respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity
with GAAP. See  Regulation Statutory Accounting Principles  in Item 1 of Part I of the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Key differences relate to, among other items, deferred acquisition costs, limitations on
deferred income taxes, reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes. See Note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on
dividend limitations related to the U.S. Insurance Companies. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, United National Specialty Insurance Company paid a $12.0 million dividend to its parent company, Diamond State Insurance
Company.    For 2016, the Company believes that Global Indemnity Reinsurance, including distributions it could receive from its subsidiaries, should have
sufficient liquidity and solvency to pay dividends. Global Indemnity Reinsurance is prohibited, without the approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority ( BMA ), from reducing by 15% or more its total statutory capital as set out in its
previous year s statutory financial statements, and any application for such approval must include such information as the BMA may require. See  Regulation Bermuda Insurance Regulation  in Item 1 of Part I of the
Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Global Indemnity Reinsurance did not declare or pay any dividends during the quarter or nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   Cash Flows      Sources of operating funds consist
primarily of net premiums written and investment income. Funds are used primarily to pay claims and operating expenses and to purchase investments.  
 The Company s reconciliation of net income to cash used for operations is generally influenced by the following:  

the fact that the Company collects premiums, net of commissions, in advance of losses paid;        

the timing of the Company s settlements with its reinsurers; and        

the timing of the Company s loss payments.

  Net cash used for operating activities was $9.3 million and $1.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flows of approximately $8.1 million from the prior year was primarily a net result of the following items:  
   
   The decline in net premiums collected of $40.5 million is primarily due to the settlement of a terminated quota share
agreement between American Reliable and Bankers Atlantic Reinsurance Company.    See the consolidated statement of cash flows in the consolidated financial
statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report for details concerning the Company s investing and financing activities      Liquidity    
   Stop Loss Agreement, Quota Share Arrangements and Intercompany Pooling Arrangement    
 Global Indemnity s U.S. insurance companies, excluding Personal Lines, and Global Indemnity Reinsurance participated in a stop loss agreement that
provided protection to the U.S. insurance companies, excluding Personal Lines, in a loss corridor from 70% to 90% subject to certain restrictions. This agreement was terminated on a prospective basis on January 1, 2016. 
 During 2015, the Company s U.S. insurance companies participated in quota share reinsurance agreements with Global Indemnity Reinsurance whereby 50% of
the net retained business of the U.S. insurance companies was ceded to Global Indemnity Reinsurance. Effective January 1, 2016, the cession percentage was lowered to 40% from 50%. These agreements exclude named storms. Global Indemnity
Reinsurance is an unauthorized reinsurer. As a result, any losses and unearned premiums that are ceded to Global Indemnity Reinsurance by the U.S. insurance companies must be collateralized. To satisfy this requirement, Global Indemnity
Reinsurance has set up custodial trust accounts on behalf of the U.S. insurance companies.      Location-Specific Quota Share    
 Effective May 1, 2016, the Company purchased a location specific quota share whereby 50% of the net retained underwriting results were ceded for certain states
and business segments. Recoveries under the treaty are subject to a $100 million limit for a single property loss occurrence and $3 million for a single casualty loss occurrence. This treaty expires on May 1, 2017.  
 Other than the items discussed in the preceding paragraphs, there have been no material changes to the Company s liquidity during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. Please see Item 7 of Part II in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the Company s liquidity.  
   Capital Resources      There have been no material

  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   
 Some of the statements under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and elsewhere in this
report may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Security Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that reflect the Company s current views with respect to future events and financial
performance. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as  believe,   expect,   may, 
 will,   should,   project,   plan,   seek,   intend,  or  anticipate  or the negative thereof or comparable terminology, and include discussions of strategy, financial
projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions, statements regarding plans, objectives, expectations or consequences of identified transactions or natural disasters, and statements about the future performance, operations, products and
services of the companies.    The Company s business and operations are and will be subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.
Consequently, actual results and experience may materially differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of Part I in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as supplemented by the
Company s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed July 15, 2016, for risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results and experience to differ from those projected. The Company s forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they were made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or
otherwise.      

Item 3.  
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Global equities posted positive results for
the quarter ending 30 September 2016, as investors quickly put Brexit fears in the rearview mirror. Expectations for continued accommodative monetary policy from central banks around the globe helped to stoke investors  risk appetites. In
the United States, economic data releases during the quarter were mixed. US equities climbed for the fourth consecutive quarter, ending September with a 7.8% year-to-date advance. Within the S P 500 Index, seven of the 11 sectors posted positive
results.    Volatility across the major fixed income asset classes declined markedly in the third quarter as fears about the adverse consequences of
Britain s decision to leave the European Union subsided. Credit sectors more than fully recovered from their post-Brexit shock, as the negative impact on financial markets was much smaller than originally feared. While the policy paths of major
central banks appeared to diverge during the quarter, expectations of an extended period of central bank policy accommodation amid sluggish global growth supported fixed income markets. Credit spreads tightened and the US dollar ended mixed versus
its major counterparts.    The Company s investment grade fixed income portfolio continues to maintain high quality with an AA- average rating and a
low duration of 1.9 years. Portfolio purchases during the quarter were focused within U.S. corporate bonds. These purchases were funded primarily through maturities and paydowns. During the third quarter, the portfolio s asset allocation was
relatively unchanged.    There have been no other material changes to the Company s market risk since December 31, 2015. Please see Item 7A of
Part II in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the Company s market risk.

Item 4.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Company s
management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30,
2016. Based upon that evaluation, and subject to the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
    There have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 
    PART II-OTHER INFORMATION       

Item 1.  
  Legal Proceedings       The Company is, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings in the
ordinary course of business. The Company maintains insurance and reinsurance coverage for risks in amounts that it considers adequate. However, there can be no assurance that the insurance and reinsurance coverage that the Company maintains is
sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. The Company does not believe that the resolution of any currently pending legal proceedings, either individually or taken as a whole, will have a material adverse
effect on its business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.   There is a greater potential for disputes with reinsurers who are in
runoff. Some of the Company s reinsurers  have operations that are in runoff, and therefore, the Company closely monitors those relationships. The Company anticipates that, similar to the rest of the insurance and reinsurance
industry, it will continue to be subject to litigation and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of business.      

Item 1A.  
  Risk Factors       The Company s results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous
risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A of Part I in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 14, 2016, as supplemented by the Company s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC
on July 15, 2016. The risk factors identified therein have not materially changed.       Item
2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds     The Company s Share Incentive Plan allows employees to
surrender the Company s A ordinary shares as payment for the tax liability incurred upon the vesting of restricted stock that was issued under either the 2003 or 2014 Plan. There were no shares purchased from the Company s employees
during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. All A ordinary shares purchased from employees by the Company are held as treasury stock and recorded at cost.
