Organization and Basis of Presentation   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016, and for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such
rules and regulations. However, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
the notes thereto, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments (primarily consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair
statement have been included.  

The
condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016 has been derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements
as of that date but does not include all the information and footnotes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended June 30, 2016. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any future periods.  

Going
Concern   

The Company s financial statements are
prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of
liabilities in the normal course of business. To date the Company has recorded an accumulated deficit of $103,017,034 in recurring
losses from operations and significant cash used in operating activities over the last two years, and is dependent upon its ability
to obtain future financing and successful operations. 

Our
continuation as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the additional working capital necessary to sustain our operations.
Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations. The Company estimates the
current operational expenses of approximately one hundred thousand dollars a month is required to continue to operate. This is
achieved either through profit from sales; or by management seeking additional financing through the sale of its common stock,
and/or through private placements. The minimum operational expenses must be met in order to relive the threat of the company s
ability to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance that our current operations will be profitable or that we will raise
sufficient funds to continue operating. The Company continues to trim overhead expenses to meet revenues. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary in the event we cannot continue in existence. These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

If
current and projected revenue growth does not meet Management estimates, the Management may continue to choose to raise additional
capital through debt and/or equity transactions, reduce certain overhead costs through the deferral of salaries and other means,
and settle liabilities through negotiation. Currently, the Company does not have any commitments or assurances for additional
capital, nor can the Company provide assurance that such financing will be available to it on favorable terms, or at all. If,
after utilizing the existing sources of capital available to the Company, further capital needs are identified and the Company
is not successful in obtaining the financing, it may be forced to curtail its existing or planned future operations. The Company
has already taken steps to reduce expenses. Additionally, the Company has recently changed the product offering to better align
with our product certifications and the intended use. This has resulted in three products now marketed as  Sill Plate 
to meet the accolades of our TER 1511-09,  Advanced Framing Lumber  to meet the accolades of our TER 1511-10 which
includes the attributes of Sill Plate with the addition of our Fire Inhibitor. This product is meant for the full framing package
of a wood framed building and is sold as a value-added protection. Our third product is offered as  Fire Treatment or FT 
to meet the accolades of our TER 1510-01 which includes all of the prior two accolades and is the original formulation meeting
the IBC Section 2303.2 as an alternate material to the use of Fire Retardant Treated Wood (FRTW). This change has afforded the
company and its affiliates the ability to address each segment of the market increasing sales opportunities and allowing the Company
to make a consistent margin on every sale. Nevertheless, the Company continues to experience cash flow difficulties and there
is no assurance of when it may be profitable.  

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Loss
Per Share   

Basic
net loss per share is determined by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net loss per share is determined by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic
loss per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive
securities outstanding under the treasury stock method. Potential common shares at September 30, 2016 from preferred C shares
convertible into 1.6 billion shares of common stock, preferred D shares convertible into 349.1 million shares of common stock,
1.5 billion from stock options and convertible notes convertible into 431.2 million shares of common stock. Accordingly, total
common share equivalents of 3.9 billion were excluded in the computation of diluted net loss per share for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, because the effect would be anti-dilutive.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affects the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Management
has determined that no new accounting pronouncements during the period that would affect the condensed consolidated financial
statements.  

3.
Balance Sheet Details   

As
of September 30, 2016, inventories consisted of the following:  

All
the Company s inventories are pledged as collateral for the Company s Senior Secured Notes (see Note 4). In addition,
inventory is considered finished goods as the Company sells and markets the chemicals. The chemicals include a $0 reserve for
obsolete inventory.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property and equipment is stated at cost.
Property and equipment-related expenditures for items with useful lives exceeding one year and major renewals and improvements
are recorded as assets, while replacements and maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective
assets are expensed. At the time property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated
depreciation accounts are relieved of the applicable amounts. Gains or losses from retirements or sales are credited or charged
to income. Depreciation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from
(3) to seven (7) years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over their useful life or the term of the related lease, whichever
is shorter. Depreciation expense is not recorded on idle property and equipment until such time as it is placed into service.
During the period, the Company purchased no new property and equipment. Depreciation expense for the three months ending September
30, 2016 was $13,715. 

Accrued
Liabilities   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company owed $888,145 in past due payroll taxes and accrued penalties. These amounts are recorded within
payroll and taxes payable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Also at June 30, 2016, the Company owed $64,694 in past
due sales tax in which it has filed the appropriate reports and is making periodic payments.  

Derivative
Liabilities   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued additional convertible notes payable amounts and convertible preferred
stock that can be converted to common stock in connection with raising equity and debt financing. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company s number of potential common shares plus the number of actual common shares outstanding ( Committed Shares )
exceeded the number of common shares authorized and available to issue in accordance with ASC 815-40-19  Contracts in Entity s
Own Equity . The number of outstanding common shares plus the potential common share liability has exceeded the amount of
authorized shares, therefore the Company has to employ ASC 815-40-19 ( ASC 815 ) to value common share equivalents
potentially issuable to settle conversions of convertible notes, convertible preferred shares and exercise of warrants and options.  

The
Company values its derivative financial instruments, consisting primarily of embedded conversion features for convertible debt,
convertible preferred stock, stock options and warrants, at issuance at fair value and revalues its derivative financial instruments
at the end of each reporting period or in the case of any conversion or modification of terms, at the date of any such modification
or conversion. Any change in fair value is charged to earnings of the period where the derivative financial instrument is modified
or converted. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments was determined using a path-dependent Monte Carlo simulation.
The ranges of inputs (or assumptions) the Company used to value the derivative liabilities at respective issuances, conversion
or exercise dates, and at period end during the period ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:  

For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of $450,833 convertible debt as further described below in Note 4 and
recorded additional derivative liabilities of $1,265,474 for the conversion features included therein. 

For all convertible
notes described in the following paragraphs and for the warrants, and convertible preferred Series C and Series D shares described
in Note 7, the fair value of the resulting derivative liability was $38,524,260 and $37,376,605 at September 30, 2016 and June
30, 2016, respectively. 

A
reconciliation of the derivative liabilities from June 30, 2016 to September 30, 2016 is:

operations and for general working capital. The maturity date is one year from the issuance date. In the event of default, the
Note is subject to an increase in the interest rate to twenty-two percent (22%) per annum. The holder can convert at a 40% discount
to the lowest volume weighted average price in the previous twenty-five trading day period. In the event of default the conversion
price is equal to 51% of the lowest traded price in the prior thirty trading days. The Company recorded amortization of discounts
totaling $10,590 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the discount balance is $82,743 at September 30, 2016. The
balance of this note at September 30, 2016 is $93,333 plus accrued interest of $2,329.

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities   

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal market
(or most advantageous market, in the absence of a principal market) for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. Further, entities are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value, and to utilize a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:  

Level
1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2   Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities
in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs other
than quoted prices that are observable or are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation
or other means.  

Level
3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities, and reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.  

Application
of Valuation Hierarchy   

A financial instrument s categorization
within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The
following is a description of the valuation methodology used to measure fair value, as well as the general classification of such
instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 

Convertible Promissory Notes.  
The Company assessed that the fair value of this liability approximates its carrying value due to its short-term nature. 

Loans Payable - Other.   The Company
assessed that the fair value of this liability approximates its carrying value due to its short-term nature. 

Derivative Liabilities.   The
Company assessed that the fair value of these liabilities using observable inputs described in level 2 above. The methodology
described above may produce a current fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective
of future fair values. If readily determined market values became available or if actual performance were to vary appreciably
from assumptions used, assumptions may need to be adjusted, which could result in material differences from the recorded carrying
amounts. The Company believes its method of determining fair value is appropriate and consistent with other market participants.
However, the use of different methodologies or different assumptions to value certain financial instruments could result in a
different estimate of fair value.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    

The
following management s discussion and analysis should be read in connection with the information presented in our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included in this report
and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended June 30, 2016 included in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K filed on October 17, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   

Forward-Looking
Statements   

Certain
statements concerning our plans and intentions included herein may constitute forward-looking statements. There are a number of
factors that may affect our future results, including, but not limited to, (a) our ability to obtain additional funding for operations,
(b) the continued availability of management to develop the business plan and (c) continued cease of the labor portion of our
business with E Build   Truss and focus on ramping the supply side which yields higher profits (d) successful development
and market acceptance of our products.  

This
quarterly report may contain both historical facts and forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements involve risks
and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those mentioned above. Moreover, future revenue and margin trends cannot be
reliably predicted.  

Overview    

Eco
Building Products, Inc., or  ECOB , has developed a line of eco-friendly protective wood coatings, Eco Red Shield
 TM  and Eco Clear Shield  TM , that extend the lifecycle of framing lumber and other wood products used in
the construction of single-family homes and multi-story buildings. The Company has changed its  product offering breaking
up the wood treatment into three different categories to include Eco Red Shield Sill Plate (SP), Eco Red Shield Advanced Framing
Lumber (AFL) and Eco Red Shield Fire Treated (FT). These newly created categories allow the customer to choose the level of protection
at fair market prices and allows the Company to make significantly better margins on each product. Additionally, the Company has
advanced the development and implementation of the Eco D-Fence product line.  

Eco
Building Products wood coatings are topically applied to a wide range of lumber products providing protection from mold, mildew,
fungus, decay, wood rot, wood ingesting insects, including Formosan termites. Eco Red Shield  (AFL   FT) also serves
as a fire inhibitor; significantly increasing treated lumber s resistance to fire, by way of decreasing the smoke (fire
gases) index, slowing ignition time and flame spread.  

The
ECOB system of coatings is eco-friendly and remains chemically stable over time. The coatings emit virtually zero volatile organic
compounds (VOCs), do not leech heavy metals or toxins into groundwater, and do not allow for the growth and propagation of various
molds on the cured film surface, that have the potential to contaminate occupant indoor air quality. More importantly, ECOB coatings
prevent the degradation of structural lumber that potentially requires existing homes to be periodically renovated resultant of
rot and/or insect damage, thereby indirectly preserving our forests.  

In
early 2015, the Company changed its business model to focus on coating services only and chemical sales. The Company no longer
purchases lumber for coating and resells the treated lumber. Customers have their lumber shipped to one of three facilities: (i)
Fair Lawn, New Jersey, (ii) Tacoma, Washington; or (iii) Augusta, Georgia. In January 2016, the Company further consolidated operations
with the closure of New Jersey and Tacoma facilities and focus mainly on the sale of chemicals to our affiliate network.  

In
January of 2016 Management took steps to narrow its focus to chemical product development, manufacturing and sales. Effectively
re-engineering its entire business model and closing its treating operations. While Eco s chemistry can be applied to many
diverse materials, to-date it has purposefully limited its attention to the various wood preservation markets. The Company views
its current targeted market opportunity in two large sectors:  

1)
The overall softwood lumber market for which there has been no cost-effective protection chemistry or technology heretofore and  

2)
the traditional wood preservation market. We believe Eco Building Products is uniquely positioned to disrupt both sectors. Eco
Building Products chemistry can be applied to any wood substrate where the end-user desires protection against the risks associated
with mold, wood rot, termites and fire and hence the market opportunity is extremely large.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

The
preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States of America, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors
that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition, stock-based
compensation, goodwill and purchased-intangible assets and accounting for income taxes to be critical accounting policies. A number
of significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments are inherent in our determination of when to recognize revenue, how to estimate
the best evidence of selling price for revenue recognition, the calculation of stock-based compensation expense, evaluation of
the potential impairment of goodwill and purchased-intangible assets and the income tax related balances. We base our estimates
and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.  

Management
believes there have been no significant changes during the three months ended September 30, 2016 to the items that we disclosed
as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For a description of those
accounting policies, please refer to our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Going
Concern   

The Company s financial statements are
prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of
liabilities in the normal course of business. To date the Company has recorded an accumulated deficit of $103,017,034 in recurring
losses from operations and significant cash used in operating activities over the last two years, and is dependent upon its ability
to obtain future financing and successful operations. 

Our
continuation as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the additional working capital necessary to sustain our operations.
Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations. The Company estimates the
current operational expenses of approximately one hundred thousand dollars a month is required to continue to operate. This is
achieved either through profit from sales; or by management seeking additional financing through the sale of its common stock,
and/or through private placements. The minimum operational expenses must be met in order to extinguish the threat of the company s
ability to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance that our current operations will be profitable or that we will raise
sufficient funds to continue operating. The Company continues to trim overhead expenses to meet revenues. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary in the event we cannot continue in existence. These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

Financial
Condition and Results of Operations    

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015     

Revenues
 - For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had total revenues of $25,891 of which $18,000 was to one customer, as
compared to $275,571 in revenues for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenue is mainly attributed
to the change in the business model to chemical sales only.  

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit (Loss)   -The
gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and gross loss for September 30, 2015 was $4,498 and $(103,840), respectively.
The gross profit can be attributed to the change in the business model to a chemical supplier only, the loss for 2015 can be attributed
to pricing products below cost, production worker over-staffing, plant consolidation and closing costs and excess capacity in
all of our production facilities.  

Operating
Expenses  - For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our total operating expenses were $421,437. This is compared to
$520,851 for the three months period ended September 30, 2015. Included in our operating expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2016 were compensation and related costs of $183,169. Professional fees included in our operating expenses for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $74,547. Other significant operating costs we incurred during the three months ended September
30, 2016 included marketing of $3,000, research and development of $71,500 and other general and administrative costs of $71,402.
Our operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of $520,851. Compensation and related costs of
$110,361, professional and consulting fees of $129,575, research and development expense of $79,973, marketing expense of $31,924,
and $148,255 of other general and administrative expenses. The significant reduction in expenses year over year can be attributed
to a reduction in head count and other expense reductions by the new management.  

Other
Income and Expenses  - For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had other expenses that included interest and
amortization expense of $411,635. We recorded $92,586 for the gain on derivative of our convertible notes payable and convertible
Preferred C stock and derivative expense of $827,474 as of September 30, 2016. This is compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015, in which our interest and amortization expense of $434,091, loss on derivative liability of $6,634,847 and derivative
expense of $283,603.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

On September 30, 2016, we had $28,250 in cash
on hand. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in our operating activities amounted to $424,903. Net
cash used during the same period for our investing activities totaled $0. During the same period, we received proceeds resulting
in net cash from financing activities of $408,000. 

The
following table sets forth selected cash flow information for the year ended September 30, 2016:  

Currently,
we do not have any commitments or assurances for additional capital, nor can we provide assurance that such financing will be
available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If, after utilizing the existing sources of capital available to us, further capital
needs are identified and we are not successful in obtaining the financing, we may be forced to curtail our existing or planned
future operations.  

We
may continue to incur operating losses over the next three months. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses
and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in our stage of development. Such risks include, but are not limited to,
an evolving and unpredictable business model and the management of growth. To address these risks we must, among other things,
continue to grow our customer base, implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, continue to develop
and upgrade technology and products, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse
effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements    

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements or financing activities with special purpose entities.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide
the information under this item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Regulations
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) require public companies to maintain  disclosure
controls and procedures,  which are defined as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A material weakness is a control deficiency
(within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard No. 2) or combination of control
deficiencies, that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected.  

The
Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief
Executive Officer ( CEO ), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon
that evaluation, the Company s CEO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective
at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below:  

1.  
      Up
    until June 15, 2015, the Company s board of directors did not have an audit committee, independent director or member
    with financial expertise which causes ineffective oversight of the Company s external financial reporting and internal
    control over financial reporting.   

2.  
      The
    Company does not have sufficient segregation of duties within its accounting functions, which is a basic internal control.
    Due to its size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible.   

3.  
      Manual
    process of the tracking and process of our inventory.   

Considering
the material weaknesses, the management of the Company performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure
our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Accordingly, we believe that our consolidated financial statements included herein fairly present, in all material
respects, our consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations and cash flows as of and for the reporting
periods then ended.  

Remediation
of Material Weaknesses   

We
intend to remediate the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures identified above. We have already adopted
an Audit Committee Charter and appointed independent members from our Board to an Audit Committee and our Chairman of the Audit
Committee has sufficient financial expertise.  

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control
over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore,
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.  

This
quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only the management s
report in this quarterly report.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   

After
our fiscal year end of June 30, 2015, we hired a part-time Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Randall Smith who devoted approximately
20 hours per week to our business. As of September 13, 2016, Mr. Randall Smith has resigned as the Company s Chief Financial
Officer. Tom Comery has assumed the duties as Chief Financial Officer in the interim.

II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

Except
as disclosed below, we are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a materially adverse effect on
our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by
any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive
officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our
subsidiaries or of our company s or our company s subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities as
such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect.
