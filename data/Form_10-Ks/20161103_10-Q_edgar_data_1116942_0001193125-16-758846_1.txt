   Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements        (Unaudited)        (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data)
       (1) Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation    
  TTM Technologies, Inc. (the Company or TTM) is a leading global printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturer, focusing on
quick-turn and technologically advanced PCBs and electro-mechanical solutions (E-M Solutions). The Company provides time-to-market and advanced technology products and offers a one-stop manufacturing solution to customers from engineering support to
prototype development through final volume production. This one-stop manufacturing solution allows the Company to align technology developments with the diverse needs of the Company s customers and to enable them to reduce the time required to
develop new products and bring them to market.      The Company serves a diversified customer base in various
markets throughout the world, including manufacturers of networking/communications infrastructure products, tablets and smartphones, as well as the aerospace and defense, automotive components, high-end computing, and medical, industrial and
instrumentation related products. The Company s customers include both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and electronic manufacturing services (EMS) providers.   
  The accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These consolidated condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which, in the opinion of
management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position, the results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the periods presented. It is suggested that these consolidated condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
full year. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Company s consolidated condensed financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal calendar with the fourth quarter ending on the Monday nearest December 31. Fiscal 2015 was a 52 week year. Fiscal 2016 will be a 53 week
year with the additional week included in the fourth quarter.        Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Standards     
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09,  Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The objective of this update is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The objective of this update is to increase
transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those annual periods and is to be applied utilizing a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.      In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Imputation of
Interest , as amended, which requires an entity to record debt issuance costs related to debt reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of that debt. The update is effective for annual periods ending after
December 15, 2015. The standard requires the use of the retrospective transition method. The Company adopted the new standard in the first quarter of 2016. Accordingly, as of September 26, 2016, approximately $26,314 of unamortized debt
issuance costs were presented as a reduction of long-term debt on the Company s consolidated condensed balance sheets. Furthermore, the Company reclassified approximately $31,171 of unamortized debt issuance costs that had been presented as
other non-current assets as of December 28, 2015.

TTM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.    
   Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Continued)          
   In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with
Customers , as amended, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in
U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal year 2018, however application of the standard is allowed as early as the beginning of fiscal 2017. The standard permits the use of either
the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method and management is currently evaluating which transition approach to use. The Company has assessed that the impact of the new guidance will result in a change to the timing of revenue
recognition for a portion of the Company s revenue stream from  point in time  upon physical delivery to an  over time  model and believes this transition could have a material impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements upon adoption.       (2) Acquisition of Viasystems Group, Inc.    
  On May 31, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Viasystems Group, Inc. (Viasystems), for total
consideration of $248,824 in cash and 15,082 shares of TTM common stock with a fair value of $149,006, and thereby acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity rights of Viasystems. Additionally, in connection with the
completion of the acquisition, the Company assumed and refinanced Viasystems  debt, which was approximately $669,024 as of May 31, 2015. Viasystems was a worldwide provider of complex multi-layer rigid, flexible, and rigid-flex PCBs and
custom electronic assemblies.      Bank fees and legal, accounting, and other professional service costs
associated with the acquisition of Viasystems of $197 and $2,065 for the quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively, and $1,493 and $32,927 for the three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015,
respectively, have been expensed and recorded as general and administrative expense in the consolidated condensed statements of operations.      The following summarizes the components of the purchase price:       
    The value of the shares of the Company s common stock used in determining the
purchase price was $9.88 per share, the closing price of the Company s common stock on May 29, 2015, the last business day prior to the effective date of the acquisition.   
  The purchase price of the Viasystems acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities
assumed and noncontrolling interest based on the fair value at the date of the acquisition (May 31, 2015). The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and noncontrolling interest was allocated to goodwill. The fair
value assigned to intangible assets acquired was based on estimates and assumptions made by management at the time of acquisition. The Company finalized the allocation of the purchase price during the second quarter of 2016.   
  The fair values assigned are based on reasonable methods applicable to the nature of the assets acquired, liabilities
assumed and noncontrolling interest. The following summarizes the final estimated fair values of net assets acquired and noncontrolling interest:       
 
         8

TTM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.    
   Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Continued)          
   Goodwill represents the excess of the Viasystems purchase price over the
fair value of tangibles and identifiable intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest. During the first two quarters of 2016, goodwill was adjusted to reflect:   

an increase in current liabilities by $3,442 due to a reassessment of product claims and other contingent liabilities, and

an increase in other noncurrent liabilities by $22,182 primarily related to certain foreign tax liabilities.      
  The goodwill acquired in the acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes.   
   Pro forma Financial Information       The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below gives effect to this acquisition as if it had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2015. The pro forma financial information presented
includes the effects of adjustments related to the fair value step up of acquired inventory, amortization of acquired intangible assets and depreciation of acquired fixed assets, and other non-recurring transactions costs directly associated with
the acquisitions such as legal, accounting and banking fees.       
    The pro forma financial information as presented above is for informational purposes only
and is not necessarily indicative of the actual results that would have been achieved had the Viasystems acquisition occurred at the beginning of the period presented, or the results that may be achieved in future periods.   
   (3) Consolidation Plan, Restructuring and Impairment Charges    
  On September 29, 2015, the Company announced a consolidation plan that resulted in the closure of the Company s
facilities in Cleveland, Ohio, Milpitas, California and Juarez, Mexico (the Consolidation Plan) and the laid off approximately 480 employees at these sites. The Consolidation Plan was part of the Company s integration strategy to improve total
plant utilization, operational performance and customer focus following its acquisition of Viasystems. In accordance with the Consolidation Plan, the Company has combined its Cleveland and Milpitas facilities into its North Jackson, Ohio and Silicon
Valley, California facilities, respectively, and closed its Juarez facility.      In connection with the
Consolidation Plan and other global realignment restructuring efforts, the Company recognized employee separation costs and contract termination and other costs during the quarter and three quarters ended September 26, 2016. Contract
termination and other costs primarily represented plant closure costs for Cleveland, Ohio, Milpitas, California and Juarez, Mexico, as well as costs related to building operating leases associated with the downsizing of the St. Louis, Missouri
office.      The below table summarizes such restructuring costs by operating segment:   
   
    During the quarter and three quarters ended September 28, 2015, the Company
recognized restructuring charges of $1,936 in its E-M Solutions segment. These charges primarily represent severance expense associated with the closure of the Juarez facility.   
         9

TTM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.    
   Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Continued)          
   The below table shows the utilization of the accrued restructuring costs
during the three quarters ended September 26, 2016:       
    As of September 26, 2016, the remaining accrual for employee separation/severance, which
relates to employees yet to be separated, was included as a component of accrued salaries, wages and benefits and the remaining unpaid estimated contract termination and other costs are included as a component of other accrued expenses in the
consolidated condensed balance sheet. The Company expects the remaining employees to be separated and the remaining accrued restructuring costs to be substantially paid out by December 2016.   
  As of September 26, 2016, the Company has incurred approximately $15,178 of restructuring charges since the September 29,
2015 announcement and estimates that it will incur total charges of approximately $20,000 related to these closures and global realignment efforts.      The Company also recognized $3,346 in impairment charges during the three quarters ended September 26, 2016. As a result of the above mentioned plant closures and other plant realignment efforts, $1,393
of impairment charges were recognized in the consolidated condensed statement of operations related to machinery and equipment in the PCB operating segment for the three quarters ended September 26, 2016. Additionally, the Company expensed
$1,953 of capitalized software costs in the Corporate operating segment during the three quarters ended September 26, 2016.       (4)
Inventories       Inventories as of September 26, 2016 and December 28, 2015 consisted of the following:
      
     (5) Goodwill       As of September 26, 2016 and December 28, 2015, goodwill was as follows:       
    All goodwill relates to the Company s PCB reportable operating segment.   
  Goodwill balances include foreign currency translation adjustments related to foreign subsidiaries with functional
currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.

    (6) Definite-lived Intangibles    
  As of September 26, 2016 and December 28, 2015, the components of definite-lived intangibles were as follows:
      
    The September 26, 2016 and December 28, 2015 definite-lived intangible balances
include foreign currency translation adjustments related to foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.      Definite-lived intangibles are generally amortized using the straight line method of amortization over the useful life, with the exception of certain customer relationship intangibles, which are amortized
using an accelerated method of amortization based on estimated cash flows. Amortization expense was $5,949 and $6,421 for the quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively, and $17,845 and $12,205 for the three quarters
ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively.      Estimated aggregate amortization for
definite-lived intangible assets for the next five years and thereafter is as follows:

    (7) Long-term Debt and Letters of Credit    
  The following table summarizes the long-term debt of the Company as of September 26, 2016 and December 28, 2015:
      
      Term and Revolving Loans     
  On May 31, 2015, in conjunction with the acquisition of Viasystems, the Company entered into a $950,000 Term Loan
Credit Agreement (Term Loan). Additionally, the Company entered into a $150,000 U.S. Asset-Based Lending Credit Agreement (U.S. ABL) and a $150,000 Asia Asset-Based Lending Credit agreement (Asia ABL) (collectively the ABL Revolving Loans). The
Company drew $80,000 of the U.S. ABL at the closing of the acquisition of Viasystems.      The Term Loan was
issued at a discount at 96.5% and bears interest at a floating rate of LIBOR, with a 1.0% LIBOR floor, plus an applicable interest margin of 5.0%, or JP Morgan Chase Bank s prime rate, with a 2% floor, plus a margin of 4%, at the Company s
option. At September 26, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan was 6.0%. There is no provision, other than an event of default, for the interest margin to increase. The Term Loan will mature on
May 31, 2021. The Term Loan is secured by a significant amount of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of 65% of voting stock of the Company s first tier foreign subsidiaries and is structurally senior to
the Company s convertible senior notes. See Convertible Senior Notes below.      The U.S. ABL consists of
three tranches comprised of a revolving credit facility of up to $150,000, a letter of credit facility of up to $75,000, and swingline loans of up to $30,000, provided that at no time may amounts outstanding under the tranches exceed in aggregate
$150,000 or the applicable borrowing base, which is a percentage of the principal amount of Eligible Accounts, as defined in the U.S. ABL agreement. Borrowings under the U.S. ABL bear interest at either a floating rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 175
basis points or JP Morgan Chase Bank s prime rate plus a margin of 75 basis points, at the Company s option. At September 26, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the U.S. ABL was 2.27%. The
applicable margin can vary based on the remaining availability of the facility, from 150 to 200 basis points for LIBOR-based loans or from 50 to 100 basis points for JP Morgan Chase Bank s prime rate-based loans. Other than availability and an
event of default, there are no other provisions for the interest margin to increase. The U.S. ABL will mature on May 31, 2020. Loans made under the U.S. ABL are secured first by all of the Company s domestic cash, receivables and
inventories as well as by a second position against a significant amount of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of 65% of voting stock of the Company s first tier foreign subsidiaries and are structurally senior
to the Company s convertible senior notes. See Convertible Senior Notes below. At September 26, 2016, $80,000 of the U.S. ABL was outstanding and classified as short-term debt.   
  The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the full and timely payment of all
Term Loan and U.S. ABL related obligations.      The Asia ABL consists of two tranches comprised of a revolving
credit facility of up to $150,000 and a letter of credit facility of up to $100,000, provided that at no time may amounts outstanding under both tranches exceed in aggregate $150,000 or the applicable borrowing base, which is a percentage of the
principal amount of Eligible Accounts, as defined in the Asia ABL agreement. Borrowings under the Asia ABL bear interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. There is no provision, other than an event of default, for the interest
margin to increase. The Asia ABL will mature on May 22, 2020. Loans made under the Asia ABL are secured by a portion of cash and receivables of certain of the Companies subsidiaries in Asia and are structurally senior to the Company s
domestic obligations, including the convertible senior notes. See Convertible Senior Notes below. Additionally, certain of the Company s subsidiaries in Asia have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the full and timely payment of all Asia ABL
related obligations. At September 26, 2016, none of the Asia ABL was outstanding.   
         12

TTM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.    
   Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Continued)          
   The Company is required to make scheduled payments of the outstanding
Term Loan balance on a quarterly basis. Based on certain parameters defined in the Term Loan agreement, the Company may be required to make an additional principal payment on an annual basis. Any additional annual payments or prepayments reduce
future required quarterly scheduled payments. During the three quarters ended September 26, 2016, the Company made debt principal payments totaling $106,482, representing normally scheduled principal payments as well as additional prepayments of
principal. Any other outstanding balances under the Term Loan are due at the maturity date of May 31, 2021. Borrowings under the Term Loan are subject to various financial and operating covenants including maintaining a maximum total leverage
ratio. Under the occurrence of certain events, the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL are subject to various financial and operational covenants, including maintaining minimum fixed charge coverage ratios. At September 26, 2016, the Company was in compliance
with the covenants under the Term Loan, the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL.      As of September 26, 2016 and December
28, 2015, remaining unamortized debt discount of $25,405 and $30,242, respectively, and debt issuance costs of $22,361 and $26,619, respectively, related to the Term Loan. These debt discount and debt issuance costs are recorded as a reduction of
the Term Loan and are amortized over the duration of the Term Loan into interest expense using an effective interest rate of 7.50%.      Additionally, remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the ABL Revolving Loans were $3,573 and $4,303 as of September 26, 2016 and December 28, 2015, respectively. These debt issuance costs
are included in other non-current assets and are amortized to interest expense over the duration of the ABL Revolving Loans using the straight line method of amortization.   
  At September 26, 2016, the remaining amortization period for the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs for
both the Term Loan and the ABL Revolving Loans was 4.6 years.      The Company is required to pay a commitment fee
of 0.25% to 0.375% per annum on any unused portion of the U.S. ABL or Asia ABL based on utilization levels. Additionally, the Company also paid commitment fees of 0.5% per annum on the unused portion of the $90,000 senior secured revolving
loan associated with the terminated 2012 credit agreement for the three quarters ended September 28, 2015. The Company incurred total commitment fees related to unused borrowing availability of $171 and $200 for the quarters ended September 26, 2016
and September 28, 2015, respectively, and $516 and $565 for the three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively. As of September 26, 2016, the outstanding amount of the Term Loan was $841,143, of which $66,143 is
included as short-term debt and the remaining $775,000 is included as long-term debt. Additionally, $80,000 of the U.S. ABL and none of the Asia ABL was outstanding as of September 26, 2016. Available borrowing capacity under the U.S. ABL and Asia
ABL was $63,003 and $142,904, which includes letters of credit outstanding of $6,997 and $7,096 mentioned below, respectively, at September 26, 2016.      Subsequent to September 26, 2016, the Company issued a new $775,000 Term Loan (New Term Loan) at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.25%, a reduction of 75 basis points from its previous Term Loan, and
repaid in full the $841,143 of the previously issued Term Loan outstanding, which resulted in an overall net reduction of $66,143 in the Term Loan outstanding. Principal payments under the New Term Loan are due quarterly beginning in April 2020
with the balance due on May 31, 2021, the same maturity as the previous Term Loan. In addition, the Company amended its U.S. ABL credit facility to increase the amount available under the U.S. ABL to $200,000, reduce the applicable margin
by 0.25% for both Eurodollar loans and ABR loans, and reduce the Letters of Credit Facilities to $50,000.        Letters of Credit
       The Company has up to $75,000 and $100,000 Letters of Credit Facilities under the U.S. ABL and the
Asia ABL, respectively, as mentioned above. As of September 26, 2016, letters of credit in the amount of $6,997 were outstanding under the U.S. ABL and $7,096 were outstanding under the Asia ABL with various expiration dates through September 2017.
     At December 28, 2015, certain letters of credit were securitized by cash collateral. As such the Company had
recorded such cash as restricted cash on the consolidated condensed balance sheet as of December 28, 2015. As of September 26, 2016, none of the letters of credit were securitized by cash collateral.   
    Convertible Senior Notes due 2020        The Company issued 1.75% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2020 in a public offering for an aggregate principal amount of $250,000 in 2013. The convertible senior notes bear interest at a
rate of 1.75% per annum. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The convertible senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally to the Company s future unsecured senior
indebtedness and are senior in right of payment to any of the Company s future subordinated indebtedness.

     Convertible Senior Notes due 2015     
  The Company issued 3.25% convertible senior notes due on May 15, 2015 in a public offering for an aggregate principal
amount of $175,000. In May 2015 the outstanding principal of $32,395 plus accrued interest was paid in full.   
  As of September 26, 2016 and December 28, 2015, the following summarizes the equity components of the convertible
senior notes included in additional paid-in capital:       
    The components of interest expense resulting from the convertible senior notes for the
quarters and three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015 are as follows:       
    As of September 26, 2016 and December 28, 2015, remaining unamortized debt discount of
$39,449 and $45,426, respectively, and debt issuance costs of $3,953 and $4,552, respectively, related to the convertible senior notes. These debt discount and debt issuance costs are recorded as a reduction of the convertible senior notes and are
being amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible senior notes using the effective interest rate method. At September 26, 2016, the remaining weighted average amortization period for the unamortized senior convertible note
discount and debt issuance costs was 4.2 years.      For the quarter and three quarters ended September 26, 2016
and September 28, 2015, the amortization of the convertible senior notes due 2020 debt discount and debt issuance costs was based on an effective interest rate of 6.48%. For the three quarters ended September 28, 2015, the amortization of the
convertible senior notes due 2015 debt discount and debt issuance costs was based on an effective interest rate of 8.37%.        Other Credit
Facility        Additionally, the Company is party to a revolving loan credit facility (Chinese Revolver)
with a lender in China. Under this arrangement, the lender has made available to the Company approximately $34,500 in unsecured borrowing with all terms of the borrowing to be negotiated at the time the Chinese Revolver is drawn upon. There are no
commitment fees on the unused portion of the Chinese Revolver, and this arrangement expires in December 2016. As of September 26, 2016, the Chinese Revolver had not been drawn upon.

     Loss on Extinguishment of Debt     
  The Company became a party to its current Term Loan and ABL Revolving Loans during the second quarter of 2015 in order to
refinance and pay in full the remaining outstanding amount of $225,700 under an existing 2012 credit agreement, as well as to finance the acquisition of Viasystems and refinance Viasystems  outstanding debt. As a result, the Company recognized
losses of approximately $802 for the three quarters ended September 28, 2015 resulting from the write off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the terminated 2012 credit agreement.   
   (8) Income Taxes       The Company s effective tax rate will generally differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to favorable tax rates associated with earnings from the Company s operations in lower-tax
jurisdictions such as China, the apportioned state income tax rates, generation of other credits and deductions available to the Company, changes in valuation allowances, and certain non-deductible items.   
  During the quarter and three quarters ended September 26, 2016, the Company s effective tax rate was impacted by a
net discrete benefit of $240 and $6,733, respectively, related to (i) tax holiday benefits, (ii) release of uncertain tax positions due to expiration of the statute of limitations in a foreign jurisdiction, and (iii) accrued interest on existing
uncertain tax positions. Additionally, no tax benefit was recorded on the losses incurred in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions as a result of corresponding increases in the valuation allowances in these jurisdictions. The Company s
foreign earnings attributable to certain foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested in such foreign jurisdictions and, therefore, no deferred tax liabilities for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of those certain foreign
subsidiaries are recorded.      Certain entities in China operated under tax incentives effective through 2016.
For the quarter and three quarters ended September 26, 2016, the tax incentives decreased Chinese taxes by approximately $1,564 and $6,089, respectively, which increased basic earnings per share by $0.02 and $0.06, and increased diluted earnings per
share by $0.01 and $0.05, respectively.       (9) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)    
  The following provides a summary of the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 26,
2016 and December 28, 2015:

   The following provides a summary of reclassifications out of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) for the quarters and three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015:       
     (10) Significant Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk    
  In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to its customers, which are concentrated primarily in the
automotive, cellular phone, computer, networking and communications and aerospace and defense industries. Most customers to which the Company extends credit are located outside the United States, with the exception of certain customers in the
aerospace and defense industries. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers, does not require collateral, and considers the credit risk profile of the entity from which the receivable is due in further evaluating collection risk.
     The Company s customers include both OEM and EMS companies. The Company s OEM customers often
direct a significant portion of their purchases through EMS companies. While the Company s customers include both OEM and EMS providers, the Company measures customer concentration based on OEM companies, as they are the ultimate end customers.
     For both of the quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, one customer accounted for
approximately 17% of the Company s net sales. For the three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, one customer accounted for approximately 13% and 21%, respectively, of the Company s net sales. There were no other
customers that accounted for 10% or more of net sales for the quarters or three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015.   
   (11) Fair Value Measures       The Company measures at fair value its financial and non-financial assets by using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, essentially an exit price, based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability.
     The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company s financial instruments at September 26,
2016 and December 28, 2015 were as follows:       
    The fair value of the long-term debt was estimated based on quoted market prices or
discounting the debt over its life using current market rates for similar debt as of September 26, 2016 and December 28, 2015, which are considered Level 1 and Level 2 inputs.   
  The fair value of the convertible senior notes was estimated based on quoted market prices of the securities on an active
exchange, which are considered Level 1 and Level 2 inputs.      As of September 26, 2016 and December 28,
2015, the Company s other financial instruments also included cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. Due to short-term maturities, the carrying amount of these instruments approximates fair value. Our cash and cash
equivalents at September 26, 2016 consisted of $117,566 held in the U.S., with the remaining $174,217 held by foreign subsidiaries.   
         16

TTM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.    
   Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Continued)          
   The majority of the Company s non-financial assets and liabilities,
which include goodwill, intangible assets, inventories, and property, plant and equipment, are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis. However, if certain triggering events occur such that a non-financial instrument is
required to be evaluated for impairment (at least annually for goodwill), based upon a comparison of the non-financial instrument s fair value to its carrying value, an impairment is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the fair value, if
the carrying value exceeds the fair value.      The Company recognized impairment charges related to long-lived
assets of $3,346 in the three quarters ended September 26, 2016. The fair values of the impaired long-lived assets were based on level 2 and 3 inputs. There was no impairment of long-lived assets recognized in the quarter ended September 26, 2016 or
for the quarter and three quarters ended September 28, 2015.       (12) Commitments and Contingencies    
    Legal Matters        The Company is subject to various legal matters, which it considers normal for its business activities. While the Company currently believes that the amount of any reasonably possible loss for known
matters would not be material to the Company s financial condition, the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict. In the event of an adverse outcome, the ultimate potential loss could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s financial condition or results of operations in a particular period. The Company has accrued amounts for its loss contingencies which are probable and estimable as of September 26, 2016 and December 28, 2015. However, these
amounts are not material to the consolidated condensed financial statements of the Company.        Environmental Matters     
  The process to manufacture PCBs requires adherence to city, county, state, federal, and foreign environmental regulations
regarding the storage, use, handling, and disposal of chemicals, solid wastes, and other hazardous materials, as well as compliance with air quality standards and chemical use reporting. The Company believes that its facilities in the United States,
Canada and Mexico comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. In China, governmental authorities have adopted new rules and regulations governing environmental issues. An update to the Chinese environmental
waste water law was issued in late 2012, allowing for an interim period in which plants subject to such law may install equipment that meets the new regulatory regime. Some of the Company s plants in China are not yet in full compliance with
the updated environmental regulations. The Company believes it has developed plans acceptable to the Chinese government and is in the process of implementing these plans. The Company does not anticipate any immediate risk of government fines or
temporary closure of its Chinese plants. The Company has established and enacted an investment plan related to the efforts to come into full compliance with the new regulations. The 2016 capital expenditure costs expected for these plans are
included in the Company s capital expenditure projections.

    (13) Earnings Per Share    
  The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to calculate basic earnings (loss) per share and
diluted earnings (loss) per share for the quarters and three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015:       
    For the quarter and three quarters ended September 26, 2016, performance-based stock
units (PRUs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options to purchase 233 and 1,174 shares of common stock, respectively, were not considered in calculating diluted earnings per share because the options  exercise prices or the total
expected proceeds under the treasury stock method for performance-based stock units, restricted stock units or stock options was greater than the average market price of common shares during the applicable quarter and three quarters and, therefore,
the effect would be anti-dilutive.      For the three quarters ended September 26, 2016, the effect of shares of
common stock related to the Company s convertible senior notes, based on the if-converted method, were not included in the computation of dilutive earnings per share as the impact would be anti-dilutive.   
  For the quarter and three quarters ended September 28, 2015, potential shares of common stock, consisting of stock
options to purchase approximately 422 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $5.78 to $16.82 per share, 2,326 RSUs, and 275 PRUs were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the Company incurred a net
loss and, as a result, the impact would be anti-dilutive.      For the quarters and three quarters ended September
26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, outstanding warrants to purchase 25,940 and 27,500 shares of common stock, respectively, were not included in the computation of dilutive earnings per share because the strike price of the warrants to purchase the
Company s common stock were greater than the average market price of common shares during the applicable quarters and three quarters, and therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive.

    (14) Stock-Based Compensation    
  Stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the accompanying consolidated condensed statements of operations as
follows:       
     Performance-based Restricted Stock Units    
  The Company maintains a long-term incentive program for executives that provides for the issuance of PRUs, representing
hypothetical shares of the Company s common stock that may be issued. Under the PRU program, a target number of PRUs is awarded at the beginning of each three-year performance period. The number of shares of common stock released at the end of
the performance period will range from zero to 2.4 times the target number depending on performance during the period. The performance metrics of the PRU program are based on (a) annual financial targets, which are based on revenue and EBITDA
(earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization expense), each equally weighted, and (b) an overall modifier based on the Company s total stockholder return (TSR) relative to a group of peer companies selected by the
Company s compensation committee, over the three-year performance period.      The Company records
stock-based compensation expense for PRU awards granted based on management s periodic assessment of the probability of the PRU awards vesting. For the quarters and three quarters ended September 26, 2016, management determined that vesting of
the PRU awards was probable. PRUs activity for the three quarters ended September 26, 2016 was as follows:       
     Restricted Stock Units       The Company granted 1,814 and 1,301 restricted stock units during the three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively. The RSUs granted have a weighted-average fair value
per unit of $6.74 and $9.15 for the three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively. The fair value for RSUs granted is based on the closing share price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. There were
no restricted stock units granted during the quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015.       Stock Options    
  The Company did not grant any stock option awards during the quarters and three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and
September 28, 2015.

    Summary of Unrecognized Compensation Costs    
  The following is a summary of total unrecognized compensation costs as of September 26, 2016:   
   
     (15) Segment Information       The operating segments reported below are the Company s segments for which separate financial information is available and upon which operating results are evaluated by the chief operating decision
maker to assess performance and to allocate resources. The Company has reviewed its reportable operating segments and determined that it continues to have two reportable operating segments: PCB and E-M Solutions. This determination was made based on
the criteria of earning revenues and incurring expenses, the Company s organizational structure which has segment managers who report to the chief operating decision maker, discrete financial information, and the aggregation of similar
operating segments into reportable operating segments. Factors considered to determine whether operating segments can be aggregated into reportable segments included similarity regarding economic characteristics, products, production processes, type
or classes of customers, distribution methods, and regulatory environments.      The Company, including the chief
operating decision maker, evaluates segment performance based on operating segment income, which is operating income before amortization of intangibles. Interest expense and interest income are not presented by segment since they are not included in
the measure of segment profitability reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. All inter-segment transactions have been eliminated.      The Company accounts for inter-segment sales and transfers consistent with the Company s revenue recognition policy. The inter-segment sales for the quarters and three quarters ended September 26,
2016 and September 28, 2015, are sales primarily from the PCB to the E-M Solutions operating segment.

   The Corporate category includes operating expenses that are not included
in the segment operating performance measures. Corporate consists primarily of corporate governance functions such as finance, accounting, information technology, facilities and human resources personnel, as well as global sales and marketing
personnel and acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Viasystems. Corporate includes bank fees and legal, accounting, and other professional service costs associated with the acquisition of Viasystems of $197 and $2,065
for the quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively, and $1,493 and $32,927 for the three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively.       (16) Related Party Transactions       In the normal course of
business, the Company s foreign subsidiaries purchase laminate and prepreg from related parties in which a significant shareholder of the Company holds an equity interest. The Company purchased laminate and prepreg from these related parties in
the amount of $12,292 and $21,167 for the quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively, and $42,549 and $43,335 for the three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively.   
  Dongguan Shengyi Electronics Ltd. (SYE) is also a related party as it is a wholly owned subsidiary of an entity in which
a significant shareholder of the Company holds an equity interest. The Company sells PCBs to SYE and purchases PCBs including various services relating to PCB manufacturing from SYE. Sales to SYE for the quarters ended September 26, 2016 and
September 28, 2015 were $254 and $1,042, respectively, and $863 and $3,867 for the three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively. Purchases of PCBs, including various services relating to PCB manufacturing, for
the quarter ended September 28, 2015 were $344, and $1,840 for the three quarters ended September 28, 2015. There were no purchases of PCBs including various services relating to PCB manufacturing for the quarter or three quarters ended September
26, 2016.      As of September 26, 2016 and December 28, 2015, the Company s consolidated condensed
balance sheets included $16,952 and $29,306, respectively, in accounts payable due to related parties for purchases of laminate and prepreg and various PCB manufacturing services and such balances are included as a component of accounts payable
on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. Additionally, the Company s consolidated condensed balance sheets included $598 and $1,999, in accounts receivable due from a related party for sales of PCBs to SYE, as of September 26, 2016 and
December 28, 2015, respectively, as mentioned above, and such balances are included as a component of accounts receivable, net on the consolidated condensed balance sheets.       (17) Distribution of profits       As stipulated by the relevant
laws and regulations of China applicable to the Company s subsidiaries in China, each of such subsidiaries is required to make appropriations from its net income as determined in accordance with accounting principles and the relevant financial
regulations of China (PRC GAAP) to a non-distributable reserve, also referred to as statutory surplus reserve. The appropriations to the statutory surplus reserve are required to be made at not less than 10% of the profit after tax as determined
under PRC GAAP and required until the balance reaches 50% of its registered capital. The statutory surplus reserve is used to offset future or past losses. These Chinese subsidiaries may, upon a resolution passed by their respective shareholders,
convert the statutory surplus reserve into capital. An increase in such appropriations of approximately $597 was made to the statutory surplus reserve of these Chinese subsidiaries for the quarter ended September 26, 2016.   
   (18) Sale of Suzhou, China Manufacturing Facility       During the three quarters ended September 28, 2015, the Company sold its Meadville Aspocomp (Suzhou) Electronic Co., Ltd. subsidiary, which held its Suzhou, China manufacturing facility, for $21,275 and
recognized a gain of $2,504. This subsidiary was included in the Company s PCB operating segment.

we completed the acquisition of Viasystems Group, Inc. (Viasystems), for total consideration of $248.8 million in cash and 15.1 million shares of TTM common stock with a fair value of $149.0 million, and thereby acquired all of the outstanding
shares of capital stock and other equity rights of Viasystems. Additionally, in connection with the completion of the acquisition, we assumed and refinanced Viasystems  debt, which was approximately $669.0 million as of May 31, 2015.
Viasystems was a worldwide provider of complex multi-layer rigid, flexible, and rigid-flex PCBs and custom electronic assemblies.      The acquisition of Viasystems has had and will continue to have a significant effect on our operations and financial results. We have greatly increased and diversified our revenue base and added the fast
growing automotive end market to our portfolio of markets we serve. Our financial results for the third quarter and three quarters ended 2016 demonstrate the benefits of this diversification along with our strong operational execution and focus
on realizing synergies from the integration. These results are reflected in improved gross and operating margins the third quarter and three quarters ended 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015.   
  On May 31, 2015, in conjunction with the acquisition of Viasystems, we entered into a $950.0 million Term Loan
Credit Agreement (Term Loan). During the three quarters ended September 26, 2016, the Company made debt principal payments totaling $106.5 million, representing normally scheduled principal payments as well as additional prepayments of principal.
     Subsequent to September 26, 2016, we issued a new $775.0 million Term Loan (New Term Loan) at an interest
rate of LIBOR plus 4.25%, a reduction of 75 basis points from our previous Term Loan, and repaid in full the $841.1 million of our previous Term Loan outstanding, which resulted in an overall net reduction of $66.1 million in the Term Loan
outstanding. Principal payments under the New Term Loan are due quarterly beginning in April 2020 with the balance due on May 31, 2021, the same maturity as the previous Term Loan. In addition, we amended our U.S. ABL credit facility to
increase the amount available under the U.S. ABL to $200.0 million, reduce the applicable margin by 0.25% for both Eurodollar loans and ABR loans, and reduce the Letters of Credit Facilities to $50.0 million.   
  While our customers include both OEM and EMS providers, we measure customers based on OEM companies, as they are the
ultimate end customers. Sales to our 10 largest customers accounted for 46% and 45% of our net sales for the quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively, and 42% and 51% for the three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and
September 28, 2015, respectively. We sell to OEMs both directly and indirectly through EMS providers.

   The following table shows the percentage of our net sales attributable to
each of the principal end markets we served for the periods indicated:       

(1)  
    Sales to EMS companies are classified by the end markets of their OEM customers.      

(2)  
    Certain reclassifications of prior year end market percentages have been made to conform to the current year presentation. Beginning 2015,
Automotive has been reclassified from the Other end market.      

(3)  
    Smartphones are included in the Cellular Phone end market, tablets are included in the Computing/Storage/Peripherals end market and other mobile
devices such as e-readers are included in the Other end market.      
 
  We derive revenues primarily from the sale of PCBs and custom electronic assemblies using customer-supplied engineering
and design plans. We recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the sales terms are fixed or determinable, title and risk of loss have transferred, and collectability is reasonably assured   generally when
products are shipped to the customer. Net sales consist of gross sales less an allowance for returns, which typically have been less than 3% of gross sales. We provide our customers a limited right of return for defective PCBs and backplane
assemblies. We record an estimate for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical results. Purchase orders may be cancelled prior to shipment. We generally charge customers a fee, based on the percentage completed, if an
order is cancelled once it has entered production.      Cost of goods sold consists of materials, labor, outside
services, and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products. Shipping and handling fees and related freight costs and supplies associated with shipping products are also included as a component of cost of goods sold. Many
factors affect our gross margin, including capacity utilization, product mix, production volume, and yield. We generally do not participate in any significant long-term contracts with suppliers, and we believe there are a number of potential
suppliers for most of the raw materials we use.      Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries,
labor related benefits, and commissions paid to our internal sales force, independent sales representatives, and our sales support staff, as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows.   
  General and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive, finance, accounting, information
technology, facilities, and human resources personnel, as well as insurance expenses, expenses for accounting and legal assistance, incentive compensation expense, and gains or losses on the sale or disposal of property, plant and equipment.
      CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES       Our consolidated condensed financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
  The Viasystems acquisition occurred on May 31, 2015. The acquisition has had and will continue to have a significant
effect on our operations as discussed below.      The following table sets forth the relationship of various items
to net sales in our consolidated condensed statements of operations:       
    We have reviewed our reportable operating segments and determined that we continue to
have two reportable operating segments: PCB and E-M Solutions. This determination was made based on the criteria of earning revenues and incurring expenses, our organizational structure which has segment managers who report to the chief operating
decision maker, discrete financial information, and the aggregation of similar operating segments into reportable operating segments.      The following table compares net sales by reportable segment for the quarters and three quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015:   
   
      Net Sales        Total net sales decreased $10.3 million, or 1.6%, from $652.0 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $641.7 million for the third quarter of 2016. Net sales for the PCB operating segment, excluding
inter-segment sales, decreased $6.9 million, or 1.1%, from $602.4 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $595.5 million for the third quarter of 2016. This decrease is primarily due to lower demand in our Computing/Storage/Peripherals and
Networking/Communications end markets, partially offset by higher demand in   
         24

Aerospace/Defense and Cellular Phone end markets. This resulted in an average PCB selling price decrease of 4.6% which was driven by a product mix shift, partially offset by a 4.8% increase in
PCB shipments as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Net sales for the E-M Solutions operating segment decreased $3.4 million, or 6.9%, from $49.6 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $46.2 million for the third quarter of 2016 due to lower
demand in our Networking/Communications end market, partially offset by higher demand in our Automotive end market.      Total net sales increased $400.2 million, or 28.1%, from $1,426.6 million for the first three quarters of 2015 to $1,826.8 million for the first three quarters of 2016. Net sales for the PCB
operating segment, excluding inter-segment sales, increased $354.4 million, or 26.7%, from $1,329.3 million for the first three quarters of 2015 to $1,683.7 million for the first three quarters of 2016. This increase is primarily due to the
additional sales resulting from the acquisition of Viasystems, which accounted for $410.7 million of the net increase in PCB sales for the first three quarters of 2016, partially offset by lower demand in our Cellular Phone and
Networking/Communications end markets. These changes, including the sales from Viasystems, resulted in a 57.2% increase in PCB shipments as compared to the first three quarters of 2015, partially offset by an average PCB selling price decrease of
18.5%, which was driven by a product mix shift resulting from the acquisition. Net sales for the E-M Solutions operating segment increased $45.8 million from $97.4 million for the first three quarters of 2015 to $143.2 million for the first three
quarters of 2016. This increase is due to the additional sales resulting from the acquisition of Viasystems.        Gross Margin
       Overall gross margin increased from 13.7% for the third quarter of 2015 to 17.1% for the third quarter
of 2016, and from 14.2% for the first three quarters of 2015 to 15.9% for the first three quarters of 2016.   
  Gross margin for the PCB operating segment increased from 14.3% for the third quarter of 2015 to 17.7% for the third
quarter of 2016, and from 14.8% for the first three quarters of 2015 to 16.9% for the first three quarters of 2016, primarily due to the improved operating performance at certain acquired manufacturing facilities and the benefits resulting from our
synergy initiatives, partially offset by reduced volumes at our facilities supporting the Networking/Communications end market.      Gross margin for the E-M Solutions operating segment increased from 5.8% for the third quarter of 2015 to 11.0% for the third quarter of 2016, and from 5.7% for the first three quarters of 2015 to 8.6%
for the first three quarters of 2016, primarily due to savings from the closure of our Juarez, Mexico facility and increased production volumes at certain acquired facilities.        Selling and Marketing Expenses        Selling and
marketing expenses decreased $2.0 million, from $17.6 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $15.6 million for the third quarter of 2016. As a percentage of net sales, selling and marketing expenses were 2.7% for the third quarter of 2015, as
compared to 2.4% for the third quarter of 2016. The decrease in the third quarter expense and as a percentage of net sales is primarily related to workforce reductions associated with global realignment efforts.   
  Selling and marketing expenses increased $10.1 million, from $39.4 million for the first three quarters of 2015 to $49.5
million for the first three quarters of 2016. As a percentage of net sales, selling and marketing expenses were 2.8% for the first three quarters of 2015, as compared to 2.7% for the first three quarters of 2016. The increase in the expense for
the first three quarters primarily relates to increased selling and marketing expense incurred with the acquisition of Viasystems, partially offset by workforce reductions associated with global realignment efforts. The decrease as a percentage of
net sales was primarily due to higher net sales and saving from workforce reductions mentioned above.        General and Administrative
Expenses        General and administrative expenses decreased $3.9 million from $39.5 million, or 6.1% of net
sales, for the third quarter of 2015 to $35.6 million, or 5.6% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2016. General and administrative expenses decreased $17.8 million from $126.0 million, or 8.8% of net sales, for the first three quarters of
2015 to $108.2 million, or 5.9% of net sales, for the first three quarters of 2016. The decrease in expense primarily related to a decrease of $1.9 million and $31.4 million for the quarter and three quarters ended September 26, 2016, respectively,
in acquisition related costs, partially offset by increased expenses incurred with the acquisition of Viasystems. The decrease in general and administrative expense as percentage of net sales was primarily due to the decrease in acquisition related
costs and higher net sales.        Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Restructuring Charges     
  For the third quarter and the first three quarters of 2016, we incurred restructuring charges of $2.1 million and $8.0
million, respectively, which primarily related to the consolidation plan announced September 29, 2015 that resulted in the closure of our facilities in Cleveland, Ohio, Milpitas, California, and Juarez, Mexico (the Consolidation Plan) and other
global realignment efforts. These charges primarily represented severance and contract termination and other costs. Approximately $0.9 million and $3.3 million of these restructuring charges were recognized in our PCB operating segment for the
third quarter and the first three quarters of 2016, respectively, $1.3 million and $4.0 million were recognized in our E-M Solutions operating segment for the third quarter and the first   
         25   

Table of Contents  

three quarters of 2016, respectively, and $0.7 million was recognized in our Corporate operating segment for the first three quarters of 2016. As of September 26, 2016, we have incurred
approximately $15.2 million of such charges since the September 29, 2015 announcement and estimate that we will incur total charges of approximately $20.0 million related to these closures and other global realignment efforts.   
  Additionally, as a result of the above mentioned plant closures and other plant realignment efforts, we also recognized
impairment charges of $3.3 million for the first three quarters of 2016, of which $1.4 million were recognized in our PCB operating segment and $1.9 million were recognized related in the Corporate operating segment. The impairment charge for
the PCB operating segment related to machinery and equipment while the impairment charge for the Corporate operating segment related to the write-off of capitalized software costs.   
  If forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long-lived assets change in the future, significant
impairment or restructuring charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.        Other
Income (Expense)        Other expense, net decreased $2.1 million from $17.0 million for the third quarter of
2015 to $14.9 million for the third quarter of 2016. The decrease in other expense, net for the third quarter was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense related to the Term Loan, totaling $841.1 million as of September 26, 2016 at a
weighted average interest rate of 6.0%, which was entered into on May 31, 2015 in connection with the acquisition of Viasystems, resulting from normally scheduled principal payments as well as additional Term Loan prepayments of principal of $106.5
million.      Other expense, net increased $16.3 million from $36.1 million for the first three quarters of 2015
to $52.4 million for the first three quarters of 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the Term Loan and U.S. ABL, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.7%, which was entered into on May 31, 2015 in
connection with the acquisition of Viasystems. This increase was partially offset by $2.0 million of higher foreign currency transaction gains for the three quarters ended September 26, 2016, respectively, due primarily to the devaluation of the
RMB, which is utilized at certain of our Asia operations.        Income Taxes     
  The provision for income taxes increased by $0.8 million from $8.7 million of tax expense for the third quarter of 2015 to
$9.5 million of tax expense for the third quarter of 2016. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase of operating income in higher tax rate jurisdictions in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, purchase
accounting adjustments further decreased the third quarter of 2015 net book income before taxes in taxable foreign jurisdictions. The provision for income taxes decreased $10.0 million from $24.0 million of tax expense for the first three quarters
of 2015 to $14.0 million of tax expense for the first three quarters of 2016. The decrease in income tax expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to discrete tax benefits recorded in the three quarters of 2016 related to the release of
existing uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and research and development tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions. Further, a discrete tax expense was recorded during the three quarters of 2015 related
to a valuation allowance that was provided against our existing U.S. net deferred tax assets.      Our effective
tax rate is primarily impacted by tax rates in China and Hong Kong, the U.S. federal income tax rate, apportioned state income tax rates, generation of credits and deductions available to us, changes in the valuation allowance, and certain
non-deductible items. U.S. and certain foreign losses generated are not more likely than not to be realizable, and thus no income tax benefit has been recognized on these losses. As of September 26, 2016, we had net deferred income tax liabilities
of approximately $10.5 million and as of December 28, 2015, we had net deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $13.1 million.        Liquidity and Capital Resources        Our principal
sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations, the issuance of convertible senior notes, and term and revolving debt. Our principal uses of cash have been to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures, meet debt service requirements,
fund working capital requirements, and refinance existing debt. We anticipate that servicing debt, financing capital expenditures, financing acquisitions, and funding working capital requirements will continue to be the principal demands on our cash
in the future.      Cash flow provided by operating activities during the first three quarters of 2016 was $200.7
million as compared to $97.6 million in the same period in 2015. The increase in cash flow was primarily due to higher net income. As of September 26, 2016, we had net working capital of approximately $309.1 million compared to $277.5
million as of December 28, 2015. Cash cycle days were 46 days for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 52 days for the same quarter of 2015.      Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $57.5 million for the first three quarters of 2016 primarily reflecting purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of
property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale of $61.0 million, less release of restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 million. For the first three quarters of 2015, net cash used in investing activities was approximately
$226.6 million primarily reflecting the acquisition of Viasystems, net of cash acquired, in the amount of $169.2 million, and purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and asset held for
sale of $55.5 million.   
         26   

Table of Contents  

   Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $106.4 million for
the first three quarters of 2016 primarily reflecting the repayment of normally scheduled principal payments as well as additional prepayments of principal of long-term debt. For the first three quarters of 2015, net cash used in financing
activities was approximately $3.3 million reflecting proceeds from long-term debt and a revolving loan totaling $1,030.0 million, offset by the repayment of $966.5 million of debt, including the assumed long-term debt in the acquisition of $669.0
million, payoff of the 2012 credit agreement term loan, the payoff of the remaining 2015 convertible senior notes, and payment of debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $67.4 million associated with the new long-term borrowing and
revolver loan totaling $1,030.0 million.      As of September 26, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of
approximately $291.8 million, of which approximately $174.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries, primarily in Asia. Cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign locations are expected to be used in local operations.   
  Our 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. The expenditures will fund
capital equipment purchases to increase production capacity, especially for advanced technology manufacturing, comply with changing environmental regulations, replace aging equipment, and expand our technological capabilities.   
    Term and Revolving Loans        On May 31, 2015, in conjunction with the acquisition of Viasystems, we entered into a $950.0 million Term Loan Credit Agreement (Term Loan). Additionally, we entered into a $150.0 million U.S.
Asset-Based Lending Credit Agreement (U.S. ABL) and a $150.0 million Asia Asset-Based Lending Credit agreement (Asia ABL). We drew $80.0 million of the U.S. ABL at the closing of the acquisition of Viasystems.   
  The Term Loan Credit agreement was issued at a discount at 96.5% and bears interest at a floating rate of LIBOR, with a
1.0% LIBOR floor, plus an applicable interest margin of 5.0%. At September 26, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan was 6.0%. There is no provision, other than an event of default, for the
interest margin to increase. The Term Loan will mature on May 31, 2021. The Term Loan is secured by a significant amount of our assets and our domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of 65% of the voting stock of our first tier foreign subsidiaries
and is structurally senior to our convertible senior notes. See Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 below.      The
U.S. ABL consists of three tranches comprised of a revolving credit facility of up to $150.0 million, a letter of credit facility of up to $75.0 million, and swingline loans of up to $30.0 million, provided that at no time may amounts outstanding
under the tranches exceed in aggregate $150.0 million or the applicable borrowing base, which is a percentage of the principal amount of Eligible Accounts, as defined in the U.S. ABL agreement. Borrowings under the U.S. ABL bear interest at a
floating rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 175 basis points. At September 26, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the U.S. ABL was 2.27%. The applicable margin can vary based on the remaining availability of the
facility, from 150 to 200 basis points for LIBOR-based loans. The U.S. ABL will mature on May 31, 2020. Loans made under the U.S. ABL are secured first by all of our domestic cash, receivables and inventories as well as by a second position
against a significant amount of our assets and our domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of 65% of the voting stock of our first tier foreign subsidiaries and are structurally senior to our convertible senior notes. See Convertible Senior Notes due
2020 below. At September 26, 2016, $80.0 million of the U.S. ABL was outstanding and classified as short term debt.      We and our domestic subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the full and timely payment of all Term Loan and U.S. ABL related obligations.   
  The Asia ABL consists of two tranches comprised of a revolving credit facility of up to $150.0 million and a letter of
credit facility of up to $100.0 million provided that at no time may amounts outstanding under both tranches exceed in aggregate $150.0 million or the applicable borrowing base, which is a percentage of the principal amount of Eligible
Accounts, as defined in the Asia ABL agreement. Borrowings under the Asia ABL bear interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. There is no provision, other than an event of default, for the interest margin to increase. The Asia ABL
will mature on May 22, 2020. Loans made under the Asia ABL are secured by a portion of cash and receivables of certain of our subsidiaries in Asia and are structurally senior to our domestic obligations, including our convertible senior notes.
See Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 below. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries in Asia have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the full and timely payment of all Asia ABL related obligations. At September 26, 2016, none of the Asia ABL was
outstanding.      We are required to make scheduled payments of the outstanding Term Loan balance on a quarterly
basis. Based on certain parameters defined in the Term Loan agreement, we may be required to make an additional principal payment on an annual basis. Any additional annual payments or prepayments reduce future required quarterly scheduled payments.
During the three quarters ended September 26, 2016, we made debt principal payments totaling $106.5 million, representing normally scheduled principal payments as well as additional prepayments of principal. From time to time, we may make additional
principal payments in the normal course of   
         27

business as cash flow allows. Any other outstanding balances under the Term Loan are due at the maturity date of May 31, 2021. Borrowings under the Term Loan are subject to various
financial and operating covenants including maintaining a maximum total leverage ratio. Under the occurrence of certain events, the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL are subject to various financial and operational covenants, including maintaining minimum
fixed charge coverage ratios. At September 26, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Term Loan, the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL.      We are also required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% to 0.375% per annum on any unused portion of the U.S. ABL or Asia ABL based on utilization levels. Additionally, we also paid commitment fees of
0.5% per annum on the unused portion of the $90.0 million senior secured revolving loan associated with the terminated 2012 credit agreement for the three quarters ended September 28, 2015. We incurred total commitment fees related to
unused borrowing availability of $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the quarter and three quarters ended September 26, 2016, respectively. As of September 26, 2016, the outstanding amount of the Term Loan was $841.1 million, of which $66.1 million is
included in short-term debt and the remaining $775.0 million is included as long-term debt. Additionally, $80.0 million of the U.S. ABL and none of the Asia ABL was outstanding as of September 26, 2016. Available borrowing capacity under the U.S.
ABL and Asia ABL was $63.0 million and $142.9 million, respectively, which includes $7.0 million and $7.1 million of outstanding letters of credit mentioned below, respectively, at September 26, 2016.   
  Subsequent to September 26, 2016, we issued a New Term Loan for $775.0 million at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.25%, a
reduction of 75 basis points from our previous Term Loan, and repaid in full the $841.1 million of our previous Term Loan outstanding, which resulted in an overall net reduction of $66.1 million in the Term Loan outstanding. Principal payments
under the New Term Loan are due quarterly beginning in April 2020 with the balance due on May 31, 2021, the same maturity as the previous Term Loan. In addition, we amended our U.S. ABL credit facility to increase the amount available under the
U.S. ABL to $200.0 million, reduce the applicable margin by 0.25% for both Eurodollar loans and ABR loans, and reduce the Letters of Credit Facilities to $50.0 million.       Letters of Credit       We have up to $75.0 million and $100.0
million Letters of Credit Facilities available under the U.S. ABL and the Asia ABL, respectively. As of September 26, 2016, letters of credit in the amount of $7.0 million were outstanding under the U.S. ABL and $7.1 million were outstanding
under the Asia ABL with various expiration dates through September 2017.       Chinese Revolver    
  We are party to a revolving loan credit facility with a lender in China. Under this arrangement, the lender has made
available to us approximately $34.5 million in unsecured borrowing with all terms of the borrowing to be negotiated at the time the Chinese Revolver is drawn upon. There are no commitment fees on the unused portion of the Chinese Revolver, and this
arrangement expires in December 2016. As of September 26, 2016, the Chinese Revolver had not been drawn upon.       Convertible Senior Notes due
2020       In December 2013, we issued 1.75% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2020, in a public
offering for an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million. The convertible senior notes bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per annum. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The
convertible senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally to our future unsecured senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness. Offering expenses are being amortized to interest
expense over the term of the convertible senior notes.      In connection with the issuance of the convertible
senior notes due 2020, we entered into a convertible note hedge and warrant transaction (the Call Spread Transaction), with respect to our common stock. The convertible note hedge consists of our option to purchase up to 25.9 million common
stock shares at a price of $9.64 per share. The hedge expires on December 15, 2020 and can only be executed upon the conversion of the above mentioned convertible senior notes due 2020. Additionally, we sold warrants to purchase
25.9 million shares of our common stock at a price of $14.26 per share. The warrants expire ratably from March 2021 through January 2022. The Call Spread Transaction has no effect on the terms of the convertible senior notes due 2020 and
reduces potential dilution by effectively increasing the conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2020 to $14.26 per share of our common stock.      Based on our current level of operations, we believe that cash generated from operations, cash on hand and cash from the issuance of term and revolving debt will be adequate to meet our currently
anticipated capital expenditure, debt service, and working capital needs for the next 12 months.

    Contractual Obligations and Commitments    
  The following table provides information on our contractual obligations as of September 26, 2016:   

(1)  
    Unrecognized uncertain tax benefits of $35.0 million are not included in the table above as the settlement timing is uncertain.
         Off Balance Sheet Arrangements    
  We do not currently have, nor have we ever had, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships,
such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we
do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As a result, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.   
   Seasonality       As manufacturers of electronic components, orders for our products generally correspond to the production schedules of our customers. We historically experience higher net sales in the third and fourth
quarters due to end customer demand in the fourth quarter for consumer electronics products. Seasonal fluctuations also include the Chinese New Year holidays in the first quarter, which typically results in lower net sales. We attribute this decline
to shutdowns of our customers  manufacturing facilities surrounding the Chinese New Year public holidays, which normally occur in January or February of each year.         Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk        
  In the normal course of business we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies, as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the U.S. Dollar as a
normal part of the reporting process. Certain of our Asia operations utilize the Renminbi (RMB) and the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) as their functional currencies, which results in us recording a translation adjustment that is included as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. Our foreign exchange exposure results primarily from employee-related and other costs of running operations in foreign countries, foreign currency denominated purchases and translation of balance sheet
accounts denominated in foreign currencies. Our primary foreign exchange exposure is to the RMB. We do not engage in hedging to manage foreign currency risk related to revenue and expenses denominated in RMB and HKD nor do we currently use
derivative instruments to reduce exposure to foreign currency risk for a majority of our loans due from our foreign subsidiaries. However, we may consider the use of derivatives in the future. In general, our Chinese customers pay us in RMB, which
partially mitigates this foreign currency exchange risk.      Additionally, we do not enter into derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor have we experienced any losses to date on any derivative financial instruments due to counterparty credit risk.   
  See  Liquidity and Capital Resources and Credit Agreement, Term and Revolving Loans, Chinese Revolver and Convertible
Senior Notes due 2020  appearing in Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for further discussion of our financing facilities and capital structure. As of September 26, 2016, approximately 21.5% of our total debt was based on fixed rates. Based on our
borrowings as of September 26, 2016, after consideration of the 1% LIBOR floor currently reflected in our interest rates, an assumed 100 basis point increase in variable rates would cause our annual interest cost to increase by $8.0 million.

    Debt Instruments    
  The table below presents information about certain of our debt instruments as of September 26, 2016 and December 28,
2015.       
    See Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk , in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2015 for further discussion of market risks associated with interest rates.   
     Item 4.    Controls and Procedures             Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     
  Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial
Officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of September 26, 2016, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to
disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.   
  In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures.        Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting     
  As a result of our acquisition of Viasystems on May 31, 2015, we have adopted certain existing controls of Viasystems;
however, there have been no other material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 26, 2016 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

      PART II. OTHER INFORMATION    
     Item 1.    Legal Proceedings        
  From time to time, we may become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.
There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any such litigation. We believe that the amount of any reasonably possible or probable loss for known matters would not be material to our financial statements; however, the outcome of these actions
is inherently difficult to predict. In the event of an adverse outcome, the ultimate potential loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period.   
     Item 1A.    Risk Factors        
  An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the factors described
below, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report, in analyzing an investment in our common stock. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would likely suffer, the
trading price of our common stock could fall, and you could lose all or part of the money you paid for our common stock. The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face. Risks and uncertainties not known to us currently, or that may
appear immaterial, also may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.      In addition, the following risk factors and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements, whether made in this report or the
other documents we file with the SEC, or our annual or quarterly reports to stockholders, future press releases, or orally, whether in presentations, responses to questions, or otherwise.       Risks Related to our Business         We have substantial
outstanding indebtedness, and our outstanding indebtedness could adversely impact our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing, our ability to fulfill our debt obligations and our financial condition and results of operations.
       We have substantial debt and, as a result, we have significant debt service obligations. On
May 31, 2015, we entered into a $950.0 million Term Loan, a $150.0 million U.S. ABL, and a $150.0 million Asia ABL. We drew $80.0 million of the U.S. ABL at the closing of the acquisition of Viasystems. In addition, we and a number of our
direct and indirect subsidiaries have various credit, letters of credit and guarantee facilities. The agreements governing these facilities have certain provisions that require us to repay borrowings in scheduled quarterly installments, which began
on October 1, 2015. We may also be required to make an additional principal payment on an annual basis, based on certain parameters defined these agreements. During the three quarters ended September 26, 2016, we made debt principal payments
totaling $106.5 million, representing normal scheduled principal payments as well as additional prepayments of principal. Such debt agreements also contain certain financial covenants which require us to maintain a specified consolidated leverage
ratio and under the occurrence of certain events, a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio.      Subsequent to
September 26, 2016, we issued a New Term Loan for $775.0 million at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.25%, a reduction of 75 basis points from our previous Term Loans, and repaid in full the $841.1 million of our previous Term Loan outstanding, which
resulted in an overall net reduction of $66.1 million in the Term Loan outstanding. Principal payments under our New Term Loan are due quarterly beginning in April 2020 with the balance due on May 31, 2021, the same maturity as the previous
Term Loan. In addition, we amended our U.S. ABL credit facility to increase the amount available under the U.S. ABL to $200.0 million, reduce the applicable margin by 0.25% for both Eurodollar loans and ABR loans, and reduce the Letters of
Credit Facilities to $50.0 million.      Our indebtedness could have important consequences to us and our
shareholders because in certain circumstances we may need to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing such indebtedness and dedicate funds to service our outstanding debt. For example, it could:   

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such
indebtedness;      

require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;      

impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments or
general corporate purposes, which may limit our ability to execute our business strategy;      

diminish our ability to withstand a downturn in our business, the industry in which we operate or the economy generally and restrict us from
exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;      

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate or the general economy;
     
         31   

Table of Contents  

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including movements in interest rates, which could result in
increased borrowing costs;      

limit management s discretion in operating our business; and      

place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have less debt as it could limit our ability to capitalize on future
business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures or adverse changes.         We may be
able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, some or all of which may be secured by a lien on our assets. If new debt or other liabilities or obligations are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our
subsidiaries now face could intensify.        Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we
may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful.     
  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures
and expansion efforts depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain regulatory, competitive, financial,
business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt.   
  If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments or to sell assets,
seek additional capital (which could include obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive) or restructure or refinance our debt. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet
our scheduled debt service obligations. Our operating results and available cash may in the future be insufficient to meet our debt service obligations. We could face substantial liquidity challenges and might be required to dispose of material
assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or, if consummated, the proceeds of such dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.
       We have pursued and intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of other businesses and may encounter
risks associated with these activities, which could harm our business and operating results.        As part
of our business strategy, we expect that we will continue to grow by pursuing acquisitions of businesses, technologies, assets, or product lines that complement or expand our business. Risks related to an acquisition may include:   

the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and businesses or to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale, or
other expected value;      

diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of our existing business to focus on integration of the newly acquired
business;      

unforeseen expenses associated with the integration of the newly acquired business;      

difficulties in managing production and coordinating operations at new sites;      

the potential loss of key employees of acquired operations;      

the potential inability to retain existing customers of acquired companies when we desire to do so;      

insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;      

the potential decrease in overall gross margins associated with acquiring a business with a different product mix;      

the inability to identify certain unrecorded liabilities;      

the potential need to restructure, modify, or terminate customer relationships of the acquired company;      

an increased concentration of business from existing or new customers; and      

the potential inability to identify assets best suited to our business plan.      
  Acquisitions may cause us to:       

enter lines of business and/or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;      

issue debt and be required to abide by stringent loan covenants;      

assume liabilities; record goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic
impairment charges;      

become subject to litigation and environmental issues, which include product material content certifications related to conflict minerals;

incur unanticipated costs;      

incur large and immediate write-offs; and      

incur substantial transaction-related costs, whether or not a proposed acquisition is consummated.      
  Acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our recent or future
acquisitions will be successful. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even when an acquired company has already
developed and marketed products, product enhancements may not be made in a timely fashion. In addition, unforeseen issues might arise with respect to such products after any such acquisition.   
         32

     Uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy and financial markets
could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results.        Uncertainty or adverse changes in
the economy could lead to a significant decline in demand for the end products manufactured by our customers, which, in turn, could result in a decline in the demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices. As a result of the recent
global economic downturn, many businesses appear to be experiencing weaker demand for their products and services and, as a result, are taking a more conservative stance in ordering component inventory. Any decrease in demand for our products could
have an adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the cost and decrease the availability of potential sources of financing and increase our
exposure to losses from bad debts, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.        We are subject to risks of currency fluctuations.        A
portion of our cash and other current assets is held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of September 26, 2016, we had an aggregate of approximately $529.4 million in current assets denominated in Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and the Hong Kong
Dollar (HKD). Changes in exchange rates among other currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the value of these assets as translated to U.S. dollars on our balance sheet. To the extent that we ultimately decide to repatriate some portion of these
funds to the United States, the actual value transferred could be impacted by movements in exchange rates. Any such type of movement could negatively impact the amount of cash available to fund operations or to repay debt. To the extent that we may
have outstanding indebtedness denominated in the U.S. dollar or in the HKD, the depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar or the HKD may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations
(including the cost of servicing, and the value on our balance sheet of, the U.S. dollar and HKD-denominated indebtedness). Additionally, we have revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the RMB).
Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the RMB could result in increases or decreases in our costs or revenues which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Significant inflation
or disproportionate changes in foreign exchange rates could occur as a result of general economic conditions, acts of war or terrorism, changes in governmental monetary or tax policy, or changes in local interest rates. The impact of future exchange
rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the RMB and the U.S. dollar and the HKD cannot be predicted. Further, China s government imposes controls over the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies, which subjects us to
further currency exchange risk.        Products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects,
which could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us.        We manufacture
products to our customers  specifications, which are highly complex and may contain design or manufacturing errors or failures, despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts. Defects in the products we manufacture, whether caused by
a design, manufacturing, or materials failure or error, may result in delayed shipments, customer dissatisfaction, a reduction or cancellation of purchase orders, or liability claims against us. If these defects occur either in large quantities or
too frequently, our business reputation may be impaired. Since our products are used in products that are integral to our customers  businesses, errors, defects, or other performance problems could result in financial or other damages to our
customers beyond the cost of the PCB, for which we may be liable. Although our invoices and sales arrangements generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability and related claims, existing or future laws or
unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitation of liability provisions. In addition, we manufacture products for a range of automotive customers. If any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to
participate in a recall of such products. As suppliers become more integral to the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contributions when
faced with product liability claims or recalls. In addition, vehicle manufacturers, which have traditionally borne the costs associated with warranty programs offered on their vehicles, are increasingly requiring suppliers to guarantee or warrant
their products and may seek to hold us responsible for some or all of the costs related to the repair and replacement of parts supplied by us to the vehicle manufacturer.   
    We are heavily dependent upon the worldwide electronics industry, which is characterized by economic cycles and
fluctuations in product demand. A downturn in the electronics industry or prolonged global economic crisis could result in decreased demand for our manufacturing services and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.        A majority of our revenue is generated from the electronics industry, which is
characterized by intense competition, relatively short product life cycles, and significant fluctuations in product demand. The industry is subject to economic cycles and recessionary periods. Due to the uncertainty in the end markets served by most
of our customers, we have a low level of visibility with respect to future financial results. Consequently, our past operating results, earnings, and cash flows may not be indicative of our future operating results, earnings, and cash flows.

     We depend upon a relatively small number of OEM customers for a large
portion of our sales, and a decline in sales to major customers would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.     
  A small number of customers are responsible for a significant portion of our sales. Our five largest OEM customers
accounted for approximately 35% of our net sales for both of the quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, and one customer represented 17% of our sales for the quarter ended September 26, 2016. Sales attributed to OEMs include
both direct sales as well as sales that the OEMs place through EMS providers. Our customer concentration could fluctuate, depending on future customer requirements, which will depend in large part on market conditions in the electronics industry
segments in which our customers participate. The loss of one or more significant customers or a decline in sales to our significant customers would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In
addition, we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers. If one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or were otherwise unable to pay for the manufacturing
services provided by us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.      In addition, during industry downturns, we may need to reduce prices to limit the level of order losses, and we may be unable to collect payments from our customers. There can be no assurance that key
customers would not cancel orders, that they would continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as experienced by us in prior periods, that they would be able to meet their payment obligations, or that the end-products that use
our products would be successful. This concentration of customer base may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations due to the loss or cancellation of business from any of these key customers,
significant changes in scheduled deliveries to any of these customers, or decreases in the prices of the products sold to any of these customers.        If we are unable to maintain satisfactory capacity utilization rates, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.     
  Given the high fixed costs of our operations, decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our
business. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or enhance gross margins will continue to depend, in part, on maintaining satisfactory capacity utilization rates. In turn, our ability to maintain satisfactory capacity utilization will depend on the
demand for our products, the volume of orders we receive, and our ability to offer products that meet our customers  requirements at competitive prices. If current or future production capacity fails to match current or future customer demands,
our facilities would be underutilized, our sales may not fully cover our fixed overhead expenses, and we would be less likely to achieve expected gross margins. If forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long-lived assets
change in the future, significant impairment charges could result that would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.   
  In addition, we generally schedule our quick turnaround production facilities at less than full capacity to retain our
ability to respond to unexpected additional quick-turn orders. However, if these orders are not received, we may forego some production and could experience continued excess capacity. If we conclude we have significant, long-term excess capacity, we
may decide to permanently close one or more of our facilities and lay off some of our employees. Closures or lay-offs could result in our recording restructuring charges such as severance, other exit costs, and asset impairments, as well as
potentially causing disruptions in our ability to supply customers.        We rely on the cellular phone and
mobile technology industry for a significant portion of sales. The economic volatility in this industry has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our ability to forecast demand and production and to meet desired sales levels.
       A large percentage of our business is conducted with customers who are in the cellular phone and
mobile technology industry. This industry is characterized by intense competition, short product life cycles, seasonality, particularly around the year-end holiday season, and significant fluctuations in consumer demand. This industry is heavily
dependent on consumers and therefore can be affected by their demand patterns. If the volatility in this industry continues, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.   
    Our results of operations are often subject to demand fluctuations and seasonality. With a high level of fixed
operating costs, even small revenue shortfalls would decrease our gross margins.        Our results of
operations fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including:       

timing of orders from and shipments to major customers;      

the levels at which we utilize our manufacturing capacity;      

price competition;      

changes in our mix of revenues generated from quick-turn versus standard delivery time services;      

expenditures, charges or write-offs, including those related to acquisitions, facility restructurings, or asset impairments; and

expenses relating to expanding existing manufacturing facilities.

   A significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in
nature, and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders. Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls may decrease our gross margins. In addition, we have experienced sales fluctuations due to seasonal patterns in the capital
budgeting and purchasing cycles, as well as inventory management practices of our customers and the end markets we serve. In particular, the seasonality of the cellular phone and tablet industries and quick-turn ordering patterns affect the overall
PCB industry. These seasonal trends have caused fluctuations in our operating results in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results that may be expected
for any future period. In addition, our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.        We rely on the telecommunication industry for a significant portion of sales. The economic volatility in this industry has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our ability to
forecast demand and production and to meet desired sales levels.        A large percentage of our business is
conducted with customers who are in the telecommunication industry. This industry is characterized by intense competition, relatively short product life cycles, and significant fluctuations in product demand. This industry is heavily dependent on
the end markets it serves and therefore can be affected by the demand patterns of those markets. If the volatility in this industry continues, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
       Our results can be adversely affected by rising labor costs.     
  There is uncertainty with respect to rising labor costs, particularly within China, where we have most of our
manufacturing facilities. In recent periods there have been regular and significant increases in the minimum wage payable in various provinces of China. In addition, we have experienced very high employee turnover in our manufacturing facilities in
China, generally after the Chinese New Year, and we are experiencing ongoing difficulty in recruiting employees for these facilities. Furthermore, labor disputes and strikes based partly on wages have in the past slowed or stopped production by
certain manufacturers in China. In some cases, employers have responded by significantly increasing the wages of workers at such plants. Any increase in labor costs due to minimum wage laws or customer requirements about scheduling and overtime that
we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the high turnover rate and our difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified
employees and the other labor trends we are noting in China could result in a potential for defects in our products, production disruptions or delays, or the inability to ramp production to meet increased customer orders, resulting in order
cancellation or imposition of customer penalties if we are unable to deliver products in a timely manner.      To
respond to competitive pressures and customer requirements, we may further expand internationally in lower-cost locations. If we pursue such expansions, we may be required to make additional capital expenditures. In addition, the cost structure in
certain countries that are now considered to be favorable may increase as economies develop or as such countries join multinational economic communities or organizations, causing local wages to rise. As a result, we may need to continue to seek new
locations with lower costs and the employee and infrastructure base to support PCB manufacturing. We cannot assure investors that we will realize the anticipated strategic benefits of our international operations or that our international operations
will contribute positively to our operating results.      In our North America operations, rising health care
costs pose a significant labor-related risk. We work with our insurance brokers and carriers to control the cost of health care for our employees. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts will succeed, especially given recent and pending
changes in government oversight of health care.        Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or in our
assessment of the realizability of our deferred income tax assets or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.     
  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining our provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be materially adversely affected by
changes in the mix of earnings in countries and states with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, as well as other factors. Our tax determinations are regularly
subject to audit by tax authorities, and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different
from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Table of Contents  

     If our net earnings do not remain at or above recent levels, or we are
not able to predict with a reasonable degree of probability that they will continue, we may have to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets.     
  Certain of our foreign subsidiaries have deferred income tax assets. Based on our forecast for future taxable earnings for
these foreign subsidiaries, we believe we will utilize the deferred income tax assets in future periods. However, if our estimates of future earnings decline, we may have to increase our valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax
assets, resulting in a higher income tax provision, which would reduce our cash flows.        Issues arising
during the upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system could affect our operating results and ability to manage our business effectively.        We are in the process of upgrading our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, management system to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of our business operations. We
are investing significant financial and personnel resources into this project. However, there is no assurance that the system upgrade will meet our current or future business needs or that it will operate as designed. The transition to the new ERP
system will affect numerous systems necessary for our operation. If we fail to correctly implement one or more components of the ERP system, we could experience significant disruption to our operations. Such disruptions could include, among other
things, temporary loss of data, inability to process certain orders, failure of systems to communicate with each other and the inability to track or reconcile key data. We are heavily dependent on automated management systems, and any
significant failure or delay in the system upgrade could cause a substantial interruption to our business and additional expense, which could result in an adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows or financial condition.   
    As a result of the acquisition of Viasystems, our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and other
intangible assets on our consolidated condensed balance sheet have increased. If our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we would be required to record a material, non-cash charge
to earnings, which would also reduce our stockholders  equity.        As of September 26, 2016, our
consolidated condensed balance sheet reflected $505.6 million of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets. We periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred, such that the potential for reduced expectations for future cash
flows coupled with further decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization may indicate that the remaining balance of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. If factors indicate that assets are
impaired, we would be required to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets, which could harm our results during the periods in which such a reduction is recognized.   
  We will perform our fiscal year 2016 annual impairment test during our fourth fiscal quarter. Given the recent volatility
of our market capitalization, it is reasonably possible that we could record an impairment charge by fiscal year end when we conduct our annual impairment test.   
    Adverse judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course
of our business could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to operate our business.        In the
normal course of our business, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to employee claims based on, among other things, discrimination, minimum wage, overtime pay and other employment related matters. We cannot predict with certainty the
cost of defense, the cost of prosecution or the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings. Any significant adverse determinations, judgments or settlements could reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations, limit our ability to operate our business or harm our reputation.        Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.     
  Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of engineering and manufacturing personnel. Strikes or labor
disputes with our unionized employees, primarily in China, may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their
collective bargaining agreements, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages. Any of these events could be disruptive to our operations and could result in negative publicity, loss of contracts, and a decrease in revenues. We may also
become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees or segments of our workforce become unionized, including any of our employees in the United States. We have not experienced any labor problems resulting in
a work stoppage, except for a brief work stoppage associated with the announcement of the closure of our Suzhou, China facility in September 2013.        We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets.     
  Most of our sales are on an  open credit  basis, with standard industry payment terms. We monitor individual
customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. During periods
of economic downturn in the electronics industry and the global economy, our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases. Although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risks, such programs may not be effective
in reducing our credit risks.      Our five largest OEM customers accounted for approximately 35% of our net sales
for both of the quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015. Additionally, our OEM customers often direct a significant portion of their purchases through a relatively limited number of EMS companies. Sales to EMS companies represented
approximately 34% and 35% of our net sales for the quarters ended September 26, 2016 and September 28, 2015, respectively. Our contractual relationship is often with the EMS companies, who are obligated to pay us for our products. Because we expect
our OEM customers to continue to direct our sales to EMS companies, we expect to continue to be subject to this credit risk with a limited number of EMS customers. If one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or were
otherwise unable to pay us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.

     We rely on suppliers and equipment manufacturers for the timely
delivery of raw materials, components, equipment and spare parts used in manufacturing our PCBs and E-M Solutions. If a raw material supplier or equipment manufacturers goes bankrupt, liquidates, consolidates out of existence or fails to satisfy our
product quality standards, it could harm ability to purchase new manufacturing equipment, service the equipment we have, or timely produce our products, thereby affecting our customer relationships.     
  Consolidations and restructuring in our supplier base and equipment fabricators related to our raw materials purchases or
the manufacturing equipment we use to fabricate our products may result in adverse materials pricing due to reduction in competition among our raw material suppliers or an elimination or shortage of equipment and spare parts from our manufacturing
equipment supply base. Suppliers and equipment manufacturers may be impacted by other events outside our control including macro-economic, financial instability, environmental occurrences, or supplier interruptions due to fire, natural catastrophes
or otherwise. Suppliers and equipment manufacturers may extend lead times, limit supplies, or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors, which could harm our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis and negatively impact
our financial results. In addition, in extreme circumstances, the suppliers we purchase from could cease production due a fire, natural disaster, consolidation or liquidation of their businesses. As such, this may impact our ability to
deliver our products on a timely basis and harm our customer relationships and negatively impact our financial results.        We serve customers and have manufacturing facilities outside the United States and are subject to the risks characteristic of international operations.     
  We have significant manufacturing operations in Asia and sales offices located in Asia and Europe, and we continue to
consider additional opportunities to make foreign investments and construct new foreign facilities.      For the
quarter ended September 26, 2016, we generated approximately 73% of our net sales from non-U.S. operations, and a significant portion of our manufacturing material was provided by international suppliers during this period. As a result, we are
subject to risks relating to significant international operations, including but not limited to:       

managing international operations;      

imposition of governmental controls;      

unstable regulatory environments;      

compliance with employment laws;      

implementation of disclosure controls, internal controls, financial reporting systems, and governance standards to comply with U.S. accounting and
securities laws and regulations;      

limitations on imports or exports of our product offerings;      

fluctuations in the value of local currencies;      

inflation or changes in political and economic conditions;      

labor unrest, rising wages, difficulties in staffing, and geographical labor shortages;      

government or political unrest;      

longer payment cycles;      

language and communication barriers, as well as time zone differences;      

cultural differences;      

increases in duties and taxation levied on our products;      

other potentially adverse tax consequences;      

imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;      

travel restrictions;      

expropriation of private enterprises; and      

the potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment and trade.      
    Our operations in China subject us to risks and uncertainties relating to the laws and regulations of China.
       Under its current leadership, the government of China has been pursuing economic reform policies,
including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization. No assurance can be given, however, that the government of China will continue to pursue such policies, that such policies will be successful if
pursued, or that such policies will not be significantly altered from time to time. Despite progress in developing its legal system, China does not have a comprehensive and highly developed system of laws, particularly with respect to foreign
investment activities and foreign trade. Enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain, and implementation and interpretation thereof may be inconsistent. As the Chinese legal system develops, the promulgation of new laws,
changes to existing laws, and the preemption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors. Further, any litigation in China may be protracted and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and
management s attention. In addition, though changes in government policies and rules are timely published or communicated, there is usually no indication of the duration of any grace period before which full implementation and compliance will
be required. As a result, we may operate our business in violation of new rules and policies before full compliance can be achieved. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us.

     We depend on the U.S. government for a substantial portion of our
business, which involves unique risks. Changes in government defense spending or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.     
  A significant portion of our revenues is derived from products and services ultimately sold to the U.S. government by our
OEM and EMS customers and is therefore affected by, among other things, the federal budget process. We are a supplier, primarily as a subcontractor, to the U.S. government and its agencies, as well as foreign governments and agencies. The contracts
between our direct customers and the government end user are subject to political and budgetary constraints and processes, changes in short-range and long-range strategic plans, the timing of contract awards, the congressional budget authorization
and appropriation processes, the government s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default, as well as other risks, such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory
requirements.      For the quarter ended September 26, 2016, aerospace and defense sales accounted for
approximately 15% of our total net sales. The substantial majority of aerospace and defense sales are related to both U.S. and foreign military and defense programs. While we do not sell any significant volume of products directly to the U.S.
government, we are a supplier to the U.S. government and its agencies, as well as foreign governments and agencies. Consequently, our sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments and may be affected by
federal budget sequestration measures.      The domestic and international threat of terrorist activity, emerging
nuclear states, and conventional military threats have led to an increase in demand for defense products and services and homeland security solutions in the recent past. The U.S. government, however, is facing unprecedented budgeting constraints.
The termination or failure to fund one or more significant contracts by the U.S. government could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.   
  Future changes to the U.S. Munitions List could reduce or eliminate restrictions that currently apply to some of the
products we produce. If these regulations or others are changed in a manner that reduces restrictions on products being manufactured overseas, we would likely face an increase in the number of competitors and increased price competition from
overseas manufacturers, who are restricted by the current export laws from manufacturing products for U.S. defense systems.        We are subject to the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual for our facility security clearance, which is a prerequisite to our ability to perform on classified
contracts for the U.S. government.        A facility security clearance is required in order to be awarded
and perform on classified contracts for the Department of Defense and certain other agencies of the U.S. government. As a cleared entity, we must comply with the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), and
any other applicable U.S. government industrial security regulations. Further, due to the fact that a significant portion of our voting equity is owned by a non-U.S. entity, we are required to be governed by and operate in accordance with the terms
and requirements of the Special Security Agreement (the SSA). The terms of the SSA have been previously disclosed in our SEC filings.      If we were to violate the terms and requirements of the SSA, the NISPOM, or any other applicable U.S. government industrial security regulations (which may apply to us under the terms of classified
contracts), we could lose our security clearance. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our security clearance. If for some reason our security clearance is invalidated or terminated, we may not be able to continue to perform on
classified contracts and would not be able to enter into new classified contracts, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.   
    We participate in the competitive automotive industry, which has strict quality control standards.
       A significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive industry. If there was a
destabilization of the automotive industry or a market shift away from our automotive customers, it may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.   
  In addition, for safety reasons, automotive customers have strict quality standards that generally exceed the quality
requirements of other customers. If such products do not meet these quality standards, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. These automotive customers may require long periods of time to
evaluate whether our manufacturing processes and facilities meet their quality standards. If we were to lose automotive customers due to quality control issues, we might not be able to regain those customers or gain new automotive customers for long
periods of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, we may be required under our contracts with automotive industry customers to indemnify them for the cost of
warranties and recalls relating to our products.

     Competition in the PCB market is intense, and we could lose market
share if we are unable to maintain our current competitive position in end markets using our quick-turn, high technology, and high-mix manufacturing services.     
  The PCB industry is intensely competitive, highly fragmented, and rapidly changing. We expect competition to continue,
which could result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. Our principal PCB and substrate competitors include AT   S Austria Technologie   Systemtechnik AG, Chin Poon Industrial Co., LTD., Compeq Manufacturing
Co., Ltd., IBIDEN Co., Ltd., ISU Petasys Co., Ltd., Multek Corporation, Sanmina Corporation, Tripod Technology Corp., Unimicron Technology Corp., and Wus Printed Circuit Co., Ltd. Our principal E-M Solutions competitors include Amphenol Corp, Flex,
Jabil Circuit, Inc. and Sanmina Corporation. In addition, we increasingly compete on an international basis, and new and emerging technologies may result in new competitors entering our markets.   
  Some of our competitors and potential competitors have advantages over us, including:   

greater financial and manufacturing resources that can be devoted to the development, production, and sale of their products;

more established and broader sales and marketing channels;      

more manufacturing facilities worldwide, some of which are closer in proximity to OEMs;      

manufacturing facilities that are located in countries with lower production costs;      

lower capacity utilization, which in peak market conditions can result in shorter lead times to customers;      

ability to add additional capacity faster or more efficiently;      

preferred vendor status with existing and potential customers;      

greater name recognition; and      

larger customer bases.         In addition, these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements than we do. We must continually develop improved
manufacturing processes to meet our customers  needs for complex products, and our manufacturing process technology is generally not subject to significant proprietary protection. During recessionary periods in the electronics industry, our
strategy of providing quick-turn services, an integrated manufacturing solution, and responsive customer service may take on reduced importance to our customers. As a result, we may need to compete more on the basis of price, which would cause our
gross margins to decline.        If we are unable to respond to rapid technological change and process
development, we may not be able to compete effectively.        The market for our manufacturing services is
characterized by rapidly changing technology and continual implementation of new production processes. The future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities, to
manufacture products that meet changing customer needs, and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis. We expect that the investment necessary to maintain our technological position will
increase as customers make demands for products and services requiring more advanced technology on a quicker turnaround basis. For example, in 2016 we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures to expand our HDI and other advanced
manufacturing capabilities. We may not be able to obtain access to additional sources of funds in order to respond to technological changes as quickly as our competitors.   
  In addition, the PCB industry could encounter competition from new or revised manufacturing and production technologies
that render existing manufacturing and production technology less competitive or obsolete. We may not respond effectively to the technological requirements of the changing market. If we need new technologies and equipment to remain competitive, the
development, acquisition, and implementation of those technologies and equipment will require us to make significant capital investments.        An increase in the cost of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and reduce our gross margins.     
  To manufacture PCBs, we use raw materials such as laminated layers of fiberglass, copper foil, chemical solutions, gold,
and other commodity products, which we order from our suppliers. In the case of backplane assemblies, components include connectors, sheet metal, capacitors, resistors and diodes, many of which are custom made and controlled by our customers 
approved vendors. If raw material and component prices increase, it may reduce our gross margins.

     If we are unable to provide our customers with high-end technology,
high-quality products, and responsive service, or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.     
  In order to maintain our existing customer base and obtain business from new customers, we must demonstrate our ability to
produce our products at the level of technology, quality, responsiveness of service, timeliness of delivery, and cost that our customers require. If our products are of substandard quality, if they are not delivered on time, if we are not responsive
to our customers  demands, or if we cannot meet our customers  technological requirements, our reputation as a reliable supplier of our products would likely be damaged. If we are unable to meet anticipated product and service standards,
we may be unable to obtain new contracts or keep our existing customers, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.   
    We are subject to risks for the use of certain metals from  conflict minerals  originating in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.        During the third quarter of 2012, the SEC adopted rules implementing
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). These rules impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of  conflict minerals  mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining
countries as required by Dodd-Frank. While these new rules continue to be the subject of ongoing litigation and, as a result, uncertainty, we submitted a conflict minerals report on Form SD with the SEC on June 2, 2014, May 14, 2015 and
May 26, 2016. Compliance with these rules is likely to result in additional costs and expenses, including costs and expenses incurred for due diligence to determine and verify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to
the costs and expenses of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification efforts. These rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our
PCBs, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering  conflict free  minerals that can be used in our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive
prices. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may, at a minimum, face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders, and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in our products. We
may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, such customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier, which could impact our
sales and the value of portions of our inventory.        Damage to our manufacturing facilities due to fire,
natural disaster, or other events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.        The destruction or closure of any of our facilities for a significant period of time as a result of fire, explosion, blizzard, act of war or terrorism, flood, tornado, earthquake, lightning, other natural
disasters, an outbreak of epidemics such as Ebola or severe acute respiratory syndrome, required maintenance, or other events could harm us financially, increasing our costs of doing business and limiting our ability to deliver our manufacturing
services on a timely basis.      Our insurance coverage with respect to damages to our facilities or our
customers  products caused by natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms.   
  In the event one or more of our facilities is closed on a temporary or permanent basis as a result of a natural disaster,
required maintenance or other event, or in the event that an outbreak of a serious epidemic results in quarantines, temporary closures of offices or manufacturing facilities, travel restrictions or the temporary or permanent loss of key personnel,
our operations could be significantly disrupted. Such events could delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to transfer production or repair, rebuild or replace the affected manufacturing facilities. This time frame
could be lengthy and result in significant expenses for repair and related costs. While we have disaster recovery plans in place, there can be no assurance that such plans will be sufficient to allow our operations to continue in the event of every
natural or man-made disaster, pandemic, required repair or other extraordinary event. Any extended inability to continue our operations at unaffected facilities following such an event would reduce our revenue and potentially damage our reputation
as a reliable supplier.        We face constant pricing pressure from our customers and competitors, which may
decrease our profit margins.        Competition in the PCB market is intense, and we expect that competition
will continue to increase, thereby creating a highly aggressive pricing environment. We and some of our competitors have reduced average selling prices in the past. In addition, competitors may reduce their average selling prices faster than our
ability to reduce costs, which can also accelerate the rate of decline of our selling prices. When prices decline, we may also be required to write down the value of our inventory.   
  The effects of such pricing pressures on our business may be exacerbated by inflationary pressures that affect our costs
of supply. When we are unable to extract comparable concessions from our suppliers on prices they charge us, this in turn reduces gross profit if we are unable to raise prices. Further, uncertainty or adverse changes in the economy could also lead
to a significant decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices. As a result of the recent global economic downturn, many businesses   
         40   

Table of Contents  

have taken a more conservative stance in ordering inventory. Any decrease in demand for our products, coupled with pressure from the market and our customers to decrease our prices, would
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.      The pricing
pressure we face on our products requires us to introduce new and more advanced technology products to maintain average selling prices or reduce any declines in average selling prices. As we shift production to more advanced, higher-density PCBs, we
tend to make significant investments in plants and other capital equipment and incur higher costs of production, which may not be recovered.        The prominence of EMS companies as our customers could reduce our gross margins, potential sales, and customers.     
  Sales to EMS companies represented approximately 34% and 35% of our net sales for the quarters ended September 26, 2016
and September 28, 2015, respectively. Sales to EMS providers include sales directed by OEMs as well as orders placed with us at the EMS providers  discretion. EMS providers source on a global basis to a greater extent than OEMs. The growth of
EMS providers increases the purchasing power of such providers and has in the past, and could in the future, result in increased price competition or the loss of existing OEM customers. In addition, some EMS providers, including some of our
customers, have the ability to directly manufacture PCBs and create backplane assemblies. If a significant number of our other EMS customers were to acquire these abilities, our customer base might shrink, and our sales might decline substantially.
Moreover, if any of our OEM customers outsource the production of PCBs and creation of backplane assemblies to these EMS providers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.   
    If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be materially adversely affected.        We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
growth in the scope and complexity of our operations. This growth may strain our managerial, financial, manufacturing, and other resources. In order to manage our growth, we may be required to continue to implement additional operating and financial
controls and hire and train additional personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future, and failure to do so could jeopardize our expansion plans and seriously harm our operations. In addition, growth in our capacity
could result in reduced capacity utilization and a corresponding decrease in gross margins.        Our
international sales are subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt practices, trade, and export controls and economic sanctions. Any non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.        We operate on a global basis and are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and
anti-kickback laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and
their intermediaries and agents from making improper payments to government officials or any other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate and sell our products in many parts of the world that have experienced
governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We also, from time to time, undertake business ventures
with state-owned companies or enterprises.      Our global business operations must also comply with all
applicable domestic and foreign export control laws, including International Traffic In Arms Regulations (ITAR), and Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Some items we manufacture are controlled for export by the U.S. Department of
Commerce s Bureau of Industry and Security under EAR.      We train our employees concerning anti-corruption,
anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws and compliance with international regulations regarding trades and exports, and we have policies in place that prohibit employees from making improper payments. We cannot provide assurances that our internal
controls and procedures will guarantee compliance by our employees or third parties with whom we work. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or similar anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-kickback laws in international
jurisdictions or for violations of ITAR, EAR, or other similar regulations regarding trades and exports, either due to our own acts or out of inadvertence, or due to the inadvertence of others, we could suffer criminal or civil fines or penalties or
other repercussions, including reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.      Our global business operations also must be conducted in compliance with applicable economic sanctions laws and regulations, such as laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury s Office
of Foreign Asset Control, the U.S. State Department, and the U.S. Department of Commerce. We must comply with all applicable economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. Violations of these laws or regulations
could result in significant additional sanctions including criminal or civil fines or penalties, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges, or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our
international business.

   In certain countries, we may engage third-party agents or intermediaries,
such as customs agents, to act on our behalf, and if these third-party agents or intermediaries violate applicable laws, their actions may result in criminal or civil fines or penalties or other sanctions being assessed against us. We take certain
measures designed to ensure our compliance with U.S. export and economic sanctions laws, anti-corruption laws and regulations, and export control laws. However, it is possible that some of our products were sold or will be sold to distributors or
other parties, without our knowledge or consent, in violation of applicable law. There can be no assurances that we will be in compliance in the future. Any such violation could result in significant criminal or civil fines, penalties, or other
sanctions and repercussions, including reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.   
    Our failure to comply with the requirements of environmental laws could result in litigation, fines, revocation of
permits necessary to our manufacturing processes, or debarment from our participation in federal government contracts.        Our operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into
the air and water, as well as the handling, storage, and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization
Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act, as well as analogous state, local, and foreign laws. Compliance with these
environmental laws is a major consideration for us because our manufacturing processes use and generate materials classified as hazardous. Because we use hazardous materials and generate hazardous wastes in our manufacturing processes, we may be
subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of our own sites, or sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes, if such sites become contaminated. Even if we fully
comply with applicable environmental laws and are not directly at fault for the contamination, we may still be liable. The wastes we generate include spent ammoniacal and cupric etching solutions, metal stripping solutions, waste acid solutions,
waste alkaline cleaners, waste oil, and waste waters that contain heavy metals such as copper, tin, lead, nickel, gold, silver, cyanide, and fluoride, and both filter cake and spent ion exchange resins from equipment used for on-site waste
treatment.      Environmental law violations, including the failure to maintain required environmental permits,
could subject us to fines, penalties, and other sanctions, including the revocation of our effluent discharge permits. This could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities and could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we ultimately prevail, environmental lawsuits against us would be time consuming and costly to defend.   
  Environmental laws have generally become more stringent and this trend may continue over time, imposing greater
compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. We operate in environmentally sensitive locations, and we are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business, and environmental
groups. Changes or restrictions on discharge limits, emissions levels, material storage, handling, or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation to another global location where prohibitive regulations do not
exist. It is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.   
  We are increasingly required to certify compliance with various material content restrictions in our products based on
laws of various jurisdictions or territories such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) directives in the European Union and China s RoHS legislation.
Similar laws have been adopted in other jurisdictions and may become increasingly prevalent. In addition, we must also certify as to the non-applicability of the EU s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive for certain products that
we manufacture. The REACH directive requires the identification of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs) periodically. We must survey our supply chain and certify to the non-presence or presence of SVHCs to our customers. As with other types of
product certifications that we routinely provide, we may incur liability and pay damages if our products do not conform to our certifications.      We are also subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in China, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment,
storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The manufacturing of our products generates gaseous chemical wastes, liquid wastes, waste water, and other industrial wastes from various stages of the manufacturing process. Production sites in
China are subject to regulation and periodic monitoring by the relevant environmental protection authorities. Environmental claims or the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of
fines against us, suspension of production, or cessation of operations.      The process to manufacture PCBs
requires adherence to city, county, state, federal, and foreign environmental regulations regarding the storage, use, handling, and disposal of chemicals, solid wastes, and other hazardous materials, as well as compliance with air quality standards
and chemical use reporting. In China, governmental authorities have adopted new rules and regulations governing environmental issues. An update to Chinese environmental waste water law was issued in late 2012, allowing for an interim period in which
plants subject to such law may install equipment that meets the new regulatory regime. Our plants in China are not yet in full compliance with the newly adopted environmental regulations. There can be no assurance that violations will not occur in
the future.

     Employee theft or fraud could result in loss.     
  Certain of our employees have access to, or signature authority with respect to, bank accounts or other company assets,
which could expose us to fraud or theft. In addition, certain employees have access to certain precious metals used in connection with our manufacturing and key information technology (IT) infrastructure and to customer and other information that is
commercially valuable. Should any employee, for any reason, steal any such precious metals (which has occurred from time to time), compromise our IT systems, or misappropriate customer or other information, we could incur losses, including losses
relating to claims by our customers against us, and the willingness of customers to do business with us may be damaged. Additionally, in the case of our defense business, we could be debarred from future participation in government programs. Any
such losses may not be fully covered by insurance.        Because we sell on a purchase order basis, we are
subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by our customers that could decrease revenues and harm our operating results.        Although we have long-term contracts with many customers, those contracts generally do not contain volume commitments. We generally sell to customers on a purchase order basis. Our quick-turn orders are
subject to particularly short lead times. Consequently, our sales are subject to short-term variability in demand by our customers. Customers submitting purchase orders may cancel, reduce, or delay their orders for a variety of reasons, subject to
negotiations. The level and timing of orders placed by our customers may vary due to:       

customer attempts to manage inventory;      

changes in customers  manufacturing strategies, such as a decision by a customer to either diversify or consolidate the number of PCB
manufacturers or backplane assembly service providers used or to manufacture or assemble its own products internally;      

variation in demand for our customers  products; and      

changes in new product introductions.         We have periodically experienced terminations, reductions, and delays in our customers  orders. Further terminations, reductions, or delays in our customers  orders could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.        Increasingly, our customers are
requesting that we enter into supply agreements with them that have restrictive terms and conditions. These agreements typically include provisions that increase our financial exposure, which could result in significant costs to us.
       Increasingly, our customers are requesting that we enter into supply agreements with them. These
agreements typically do not include volume commitments, but do include provisions that generally serve to increase our exposure for product liability and limited sales returns, which could result in higher costs to us as a result of such claims. In
addition, these agreements typically contain provisions that seek to limit our operational and pricing flexibility and extend payment terms, which could materially adversely affect our cash flow, business, financial condition, and results of
operations.        Our business has benefited from OEMs deciding to outsource their PCB manufacturing and
backplane assembly needs to us. If OEMs choose to provide these services in-house or select other providers, our business could suffer.        Our future revenue growth partially depends on new outsourcing opportunities from OEMs. Current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our performance against other providers. They also evaluate
the potential benefits of manufacturing their products themselves. To the extent that outsourcing opportunities are not available either due to OEM decisions to produce these products themselves or to use other providers, our financial results and
future growth could be materially adversely affected.        Consolidation among our customers could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.        Recently,
some of our large customers have consolidated, and further consolidation of customers may occur. Depending on which organization becomes the controller of the supply chain function following the consolidation, we may not be retained as a preferred
or approved supplier. In addition, product duplication could result in the termination of a product line that we currently support. While there is potential for increasing our position with the combined customer, there does exist the potential for
decreased revenue if we are not retained as a continuing supplier. We also face the risk of increased pricing pressure from the combined customer because of its increased market share.

     We may need additional capital in the future to fund investments in
our operations, refinance our indebtedness, and to maintain and grow our business, and such capital may not be available on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.     
  Our business is capital-intensive, and our ability to increase revenue, profit, and cash flow depends upon continued
capital spending. To the extent that the funds generated by our ongoing operations are insufficient to cover our liquidity requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through financings. If we are unable to fund our operations and make
capital expenditures as currently planned or if we do not have sufficient liquidity to service the interest and principal payments on our debt, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
If we do not achieve our expected operating results, we would need to reallocate our sources and uses of operating cash flows. This may include borrowing additional funds to service debt payments, which may impair our ability to make investments in
our business. Looking ahead at long-term needs, we may need to raise additional funds for a number of purposes, including the following:       

to fund capital equipment purchases to increase production capacity, upgrade and expand our technological capabilities and replace aging equipment
or introduce new products;      

to refinance our existing indebtedness;      

to fund working capital requirements for future growth that we may experience;      

to enhance or expand the range of services we offer;      

to increase our sales and marketing activities; or      

to respond to competitive pressures or perceived opportunities, such as investment, acquisition, and international expansion activities.
        Should we need to raise funds through incurring additional debt, we may become subject to
covenants even more restrictive than those contained in our current debt instruments. There can be no assurance that additional capital, including any future equity or debt financing, would be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at
all. If such funds are not available to us when required or on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.   
    Our operations could be materially adversely affected by a shortage of utilities or a discontinuation of priority
supply status offered for such utilities.        The manufacturing of PCBs requires significant quantities of
electricity and water. Our operations in Asia have historically purchased substantially all of the electrical power for their manufacturing plants in China from local power plants. Because China s economy has recently been in a state of growth,
the strain on the nation s power plants is increasing, which has led to continuing power outages in various parts of the country. There may be times when our operations in China may be unable to obtain adequate sources of electricity to meet
production requirements. Various regions in China have in the past experienced shortages of both electricity and water and unexpected interruptions of power supply. From time to time, the Chinese government rations electrical power, which can lead
to unscheduled production interruptions at our manufacturing facilities.      In addition, certain of the areas in
which our North America operations have manufacturing facilities, particularly in California, have experienced power and resource shortages from time to time, including mandatory periods without electrical power, changes to water availability, and
significant increases in utility and resource costs. California has also recently experienced drought conditions, prompting the Governor of California to proclaim a Drought State of Emergency. Due to the severe drought conditions, some local and
regional water districts and the state government are implementing policies or regulations that restrict water usage and increase the cost of water.      We do not generally maintain any back-up power generation facilities or reserves of water for our operations, so if we were to lose supplies of power or water at any of our facilities, we would be
required to cease operations until such supply was restored. Any resulting cessation of operations could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our customers  orders in a timely manner, thus potentially resulting in a loss of business,
along with increased costs of manufacturing, and under-utilization of capacity. In addition, the sudden cessation of our power or water supply could damage our equipment, resulting in the need for costly repairs or maintenance, as well as damage to
products in production, resulting in an increase in scrapped products.      For example, in the third quarter of
2014, one of our principal plants was affected by a five day unexpected power outage, which increased our manufacturing costs and caused delivery delays. There can be no assurance that our required utilities would not in the future experience
material interruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.        Outages, computer viruses, break-ins, and similar events could disrupt our operations, and breaches of our security systems may cause us to incur significant legal and financial exposure.
       We rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are owned and operated by third
parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for a variety of functions, including worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing,
and email communications. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, and   
         44

similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and similar
disruptions. If we or our vendors are unable to prevent such outages and breaches, our operations could be disrupted. If unauthorized parties gain access to our information systems or such information is used in an unauthorized manner, misdirected,
lost, or stolen during transmission, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers that we
have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties, and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.        We may be unable to hire and retain sufficient
qualified personnel, and the loss of any of our key executive officers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.     
  We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled,
knowledgeable, sophisticated, and qualified managerial and professional personnel. We may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management in the future. We can make no assurances that future
changes in executive management will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our business also depends on our continuing ability to recruit, train, and retain highly qualified employees,
particularly engineering and sales and marketing personnel. The competition for these employees is intense, and the loss of these employees could harm our business. Further, our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies depends in part on
our ability to retain key management and existing employees at the time of the acquisition.      In addition, key
employees may depart for a variety of reasons, including because of issues relating to the difficulty of integration or accelerated retirement in connection with our acquisition of Viasystems. If key employees depart, the integration process may be
more difficult and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, we may have to incur significant costs in identifying and hiring replacements for departing employees and may lose
significant expertise and talent relating to our businesses, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Viasystems may be adversely affected. In addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce
and management associated with integrating employees. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key employees or that the loss of any key executive officers would not materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.        Our manufacturing processes depend on the collective
industry experience of our employees. If a significant number of these employees were to leave us, it could limit our ability to compete effectively and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
       We have limited patent or trade secret protection for our manufacturing processes. We rely on the
collective experience of our employees involved in our manufacturing processes to ensure that we continuously evaluate and adopt new technologies in our industry. Although we are not dependent on any one employee or a small number of employees, if a
significant number of our employees involved in our manufacturing processes were to leave our employment, and we were not able to replace these people with new employees with comparable experience, our manufacturing processes might suffer as we
might be unable to keep up with innovations in the industry. As a result, we may lose our ability to continue to compete effectively. For example, we have experienced a significant amount of employee attrition in our China operations each year,
which has negatively impacted our yield, costs of production, and service times.        We may be exposed to
intellectual property infringement claims by third parties that could be costly to defend, could divert management s attention and resources, and if successful, could result in liability.     
  We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual
provisions, and other measures to protect our proprietary information. All of these measures afford only limited protection. These measures may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged, and others may develop technologies or processes that are
similar or superior to our technology. We may not have the controls and procedures in place that are needed to adequately protect proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to
copy our products or obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.   
  Furthermore, there is a risk that we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. As is the case with many
other companies in the PCB industry, we from time to time receive communications from third parties asserting patent rights to our products and enter into discussions with such third parties. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion
of such claims, we could incur costs in either defending or settling any intellectual property disputes alleging infringement. If any claims are brought against the customers for such infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be
required to expend significant resources in defending such claims. In the event we are subject to any infringement claims, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may
not be successful in developing such alternatives or in obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all, which could disrupt the production processes, damage our reputation, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.

     Future sales of our common stock or other securities may dilute the
value and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.        In the future, we may issue
additional equity securities, through public or private offerings, in order to raise additional capital. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority, without action by stockholders, to designate and issue
preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may also designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each series of preferred stock, any or all of which may be superior to the rights of the common stock. Any such issuance would
reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote, would dilute the percentage of ownership interest of existing stockholders and may dilute the per share book value of the common stock. In addition, option holders may exercise their
options at a time when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms. Any issuances of preferred stock would likely result in your interest being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred
stock.        Because we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future, shareholders may
not receive any return on investment unless the shareholders sells their common stock for a price greater than that which was paid.        We have not declared or paid any dividends since 2000 and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion
of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, legal requirements, earnings and other factors. Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the terms of our debt agreements and
might be restricted by the terms of any indebtedness that we incur in the future. Consequently, shareholders should not rely on dividends in order to receive a return on your investment. See our dividend policy in Item 5.  Market for Registrants
Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2015.        Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by climate change initiatives.     
  Our manufacturing processes require that we purchase significant quantities of energy from third parties, which results in
the generation of greenhouse gases, either directly on-site or indirectly at electric utilities. Both domestic and international legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could create increases in energy costs and
price volatility. Considerable international attention is now focused on development of an international policy framework to guide international action to address climate change. Proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit
greenhouse gas emissions could affect our energy sources and supply choices, as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials that are derived from sources that generate greenhouse gas emissions.   
    Failure to maintain good relations with the noncontrolling interest holder of a majority-owned subsidiary of TTM in
China could materially adversely affect our ability to manage that operation.        A noncontrolling
interest holder owns a 5% interest in a subsidiary of TTM that operates the Huiyang, China facility that became a part of our operations through the acquisition of Viasystems. The noncontrolling interest holder is affiliated with the Chinese
government and has close ties to local economic development and other Chinese government agencies. The noncontrolling interest holder has certain rights to be consulted and to consent to certain operating and investment matters concerning the
Huiyang facility and the board of directors of our subsidiary that operates the Huiyang facility. Failure to maintain good relations with the noncontrolling interest holder could materially adversely affect our ability to manage the operations of
the plant.        Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to
liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.        In the ordinary course of our
business, we collect and store sensitive data in our data centers and on our networks, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable
information of our employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers
or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of
information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

  EXECUTION VERSION      FIRST
AMENDMENT     FIRST AMENDMENT, dated as of September 27, 2016 (this   Amendment  ), to the Term Loan Credit
Agreement, dated as of May 31, 2015 (the   Credit Agreement  ), among TTM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (the   Borrower  ), the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto (the
  Lenders  ), JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the   Administrative Agent  ) and the other agents parties thereto.

 WHEREAS, upon the occurrence of the First Amendment Effective Date, the Credit Agreement will be deemed amended in the form of the Amended
Credit Agreement;    WHEREAS, each Existing Term Lender that executes and delivers a signature page to this Amendment (a   Lender
Addendum  ) and in connection therewith agrees (x) to continue all of its Existing Term Loans as New Term Loans (such continued Term Loans, the   Continued Term Loans  , and such Lenders, collectively, the
  Continuing Term Lenders  ) and (y) to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement will thereby (i) agree to the terms of this Amendment and the Amended Credit Agreement and (ii) agree to continue all of its Existing
Term Loans outstanding on the First Amendment Effective Date as New Term Loans in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Existing Term Loans so continued (or such lesser amount as notified to such Lender by JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., in its capacity as sole lead arranger and bookrunner for the Replacement Term Loans (in such capacity, the   Lead Arranger  ) prior to the First Amendment Effective Date);  
 WHEREAS, subject to the preceding recitals, each Person (other than a Continuing Term Lender in its capacity as such) that executes and
delivers a Lender Addendum and agrees in connection therewith (x) to make New Term Loans (such New Term Loans, the   Additional Term Loans  , and the Lenders of such Additional Term Loans, collectively, the   Additional
Term Lenders  ) and (y) to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement will thereby (i) agree to the terms of this Amendment and the Amended Credit Agreement and (ii) commit to make Additional Term Loans to the Borrower on the
First  

Amendment Effective Date as New Term Loans in a principal amount (not in excess of any such commitment) as is determined by the Lead Arranger and notified to such Additional Term Lender;  
 WHEREAS, upon the occurrence of the First Amendment Effective Date, the proceeds of the Additional Term Loans will be used by the Borrower to
repay in full the outstanding principal amount of the Existing Term Loans that are not continued as New Term Loans by Continuing Term Lenders;  
 WHEREAS, the Continuing Term Lenders and the Additional Term Lenders (collectively, the   New Term Lenders  ) are severally
willing to (i) continue their Existing Term Loans as New Term Loans and/or to make New Term Loans, as the case may be, and (ii) direct the Administrative Agent to enter an amendment to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement as contemplated
by Section 6 of this Amendment; and    WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the New Term Lenders are willing to agree to
this Amendment and the Amended Credit Agreement on the terms set forth herein.    NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual
covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:    SECTION 1.  Definitions . Unless otherwise defined herein,
terms defined in the Credit Agreement and used herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement.    SECTION 2.  New
Term Loans .    (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein (i) each Continuing Term Lender severally agrees to continue
all (or such lesser amount as notified to such Lender by the Lead Arranger prior to the First Amendment Effective Date) of its Existing Term Loans as a New Term Loan on the First Amendment Effective Date in a principal amount equal to such
Continuing Term Lender s New Term Loan Commitment (as defined below) and (ii) each Additional Term Lender severally agrees to make a New Term Loan on the First Amendment Effective Date to the Borrower in a principal amount equal to such
Additional Term Lender s New Term Loan Commitment.    (b) For purposes hereof, a Person shall become a party to the Amended Credit
Agreement and a New Term Lender as of the First Amendment Effective Date by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent, on or prior to the First Amendment Effective Date, a Lender Addendum in its capacity as a New Term Lender. The Borrower
shall give irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent of the proposed First Amendment Effective Date not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, one Business Day prior thereto, and, upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Continuing Term Lender and each Additional Term Lender thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Existing Term Loans of a Continuing Term Lender must be continued in whole and may not be continued in part unless approved by the
Lead Arranger.    (c) Not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the First Amendment Effective Date, each Additional Term Lender shall
make its New Term Loan by making available to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office an amount in immediately available funds equal to its New Term Loan Commitment. The   New Term Loan Commitment   (i) of any Continuing
Term Lender will be the amount of its Existing Term Loans as set forth in the Register as of the First Amendment Effective Date (or such lesser amount as notified to such Lender by the Lead Arranger prior to the First Amendment Effective Date),
which shall be continued as an equal principal amount of New Term Loans, and (ii) of any Additional Term Lender will be such amount (not exceeding any commitment offered by such Additional Term Lender) allocated to it by the Lead Arranger. The
commitments of the Additional  
      2  

Term Lenders and the continuation undertakings of the Continuing Term Lenders are several, and no such Lender will be responsible for any other such Lender s failure to make or acquire by
continuation its New Term Loan. The New Term Loans may from time to time be ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans, as determined by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent as contemplated by the Credit Agreement or the Amended Credit
Agreement, as applicable.    (d) The obligation of each New Term Lender to make or acquire by continuation New Term Loans on the First
Amendment Effective Date is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 3 of this Amendment.    (e) On and after
the First Amendment Effective Date, each reference in the Amended Credit Agreement to  Term B Loans  shall be deemed a reference to the New Term Loans contemplated hereby, except as the context may otherwise require. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the provisions of the Credit Agreement with respect to indemnification, reimbursement of costs and expenses, increased costs and break funding payments shall continue in full force and effect with respect to, and for the benefit of, each
Existing Term Lender in respect of such Lender s Existing Term Loans.    (f) The continuation of Continued Term Loans may be implemented
pursuant to other procedures specified by the Lead Arranger, including by repayment of Continued Term Loans of a Continuing Term Lender followed by a subsequent assignment to it of New Term Loans in the same amount.  
 (g) For the avoidance of doubt, the Lenders hereby acknowledge and agree that, at the sole option of the Lead Arranger, any Lender with
Existing Term Loans that are not continued as Continued Term Loans as contemplated hereby (  Non-Continued Term Loans  ) shall, automatically upon receipt of the amount necessary to purchase, at par, such Lender s Non-Continued
Term Loans and all other amounts owing to such Lender on or prior to such date, be deemed to have assigned such Non-Continued Term Loans pursuant to a form of Assignment and Assumption and, accordingly, no other action by the Lenders, the
Administrative Agent or the Loan Parties shall be required in connection therewith. The Existing Term Lenders party hereto hereby agree to waive the notice requirements of Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement in connection with the prepayment
or replacement of Existing Term Loans contemplated hereby.    SECTION 3.  First Amendment Effective Date . This Amendment (subject to
Section 4), and the obligation of each New Term Lender to make or acquire by continuation New Term Loans, shall become effective as of the date (the   First Amendment Effective Date  ) on which the following conditions precedent

due and invoiced to the Borrower.    (d) The Administrative Agent shall have received (i) a certificate of the Borrower, dated the First
Amendment Effective Date, substantially in the form of  Exhibit B  hereto, with appropriate insertions and attachments and (ii) evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that each Loan Party is in good standing in its
jurisdiction of organization.    (e) The Administrative Agent shall have received the executed legal opinion of Greenberg Traurig, LLP,
counsel to the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent.    (f) The

corporate benefit restrictions on upstreaming of cash intra group and the fiduciary and statutory duties of the directors of such Foreign Subsidiary) from being repatriated or passed on to or used for the benefit of the Borrower or any applicable
Domestic Subsidiary or if the Borrower has determined in good faith that repatriation of any such amount to the Borrower or any applicable Domestic Subsidiary would have material adverse tax consequences (including a material acceleration of the

Domestic Subsidiary, or the Borrower believes in good faith  
      36  

that such material adverse tax consequence would result, and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow is permitted under the applicable local law or
the Borrower determines in good faith such repatriation would no longer have such material adverse tax consequences, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow will be promptly (and in any
event not later than five Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional taxes payable or reasonably estimated to be payable as a result thereof) to the prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11 (provided
that no such prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be required in the case of any such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow the repatriation of which the Borrower believes in good faith would result in material
adverse tax consequences, if on or before the date on which such Net Cash Proceeds so retained would otherwise have been required to be applied to reinvestments or prepayments pursuant to a Reinvestment Notice (or such Excess Cash Flow would have
been so required if it were Net Cash Proceeds), the Borrower applies an amount equal to the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow to such reinvestments or prepayments as if such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been received
by the Borrower rather than such Foreign Subsidiary, less the amount of additional taxes that would have been payable or reserved against if such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow had been repatriated (or, if less, the Net Cash Proceeds or
Excess Cash Flow that would be calculated if received by such Foreign Subsidiary).    2.12  Conversion and Continuation Options .

Facility have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuations or (ii) if an Event of Default specified in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 8(f) with respect to the Borrower is in existence, and
 provided ,  further , that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such Loans shall be automatically converted

(ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority
Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility that the Eurodollar Base Rate or the Eurodollar Rate, as applicable, for a Loan for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified
by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,    the Administrative Agent shall give facsimile or e-mail
notice thereof to the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made
as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans under the relevant Facility that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans under the
relevant Facility shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent (which notification shall be made promptly after the Administrative Agent
obtains knowledge of the cessation of the circumstances referenced in clause (i) or receives notice from the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility of the cessation of the circumstances referenced in clause
(ii) above), no further Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans under the relevant Facility to Eurodollar Loans.  
 2.17  Pro Rata Treatment and Payments . (a) Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Term B Lenders hereunder shall be made pro rata
according to the Term B Percentages of the Term B Lenders.    (b) With respect to any Facility, each payment (including each prepayment under
this Agreement and each prepayment under the Existing Credit Agreement) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Term Loans of such Facility shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of
the Term Loans of such Facility then held by the Term Lenders (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.11(e)). The amount of each principal prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11 (including any principal prepayment
pursuant to Section 2.11 of the Existing Credit Agreement) shall be applied to reduce the Term B Loans and Incremental Term Loans on a pro rata basis based upon the respective then remaining principal amounts thereof (unless any Incremental
Term Lenders have agreed to less than pro rata prepayments) and shall be applied within each Facility to the then remaining installments thereof as directed by the Borrower (or if not so directed, to the then remaining installments thereof in direct
order of maturity). Amounts repaid (including amounts pursuant to Section 2.11) and prepaid on account of the Term Loans may not be reborrowed.  
 (c) [Reserved].    (d) All payments
(including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 2:00 P.M., New York City time, on the due date
thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to each relevant Lender promptly upon receipt in like
funds as received, net of any amounts owing by such Lender pursuant to Section 9.7. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such
extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal
 
      39  

pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.  
 (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the
amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the New York Fed Bank Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender s share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be
entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the relevant Facility, on demand, from the Borrower.  
 (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the
Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective  pro   rata  shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average New
York Fed Bank Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.    (g)
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.17(e), 2.17(f), 2.19(e) or 9.7, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply
any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent to satisfy such Lender s obligations to it under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are
fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above,
in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.    2.18  Requirements of Law . (a) If the adoption of or
any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation, administration, implementation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender or other Credit Party with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority, in each case made or occurring subsequent to the First Amendment Effective Date:  
 (i) shall subject any Credit Party to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses
(b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit,  
      40  

commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;  
 (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit (or participations therein) by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not
otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or    (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition
(other than Taxes);    and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Credit Party, by an amount that such
Lender or other Credit Party deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Loans, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender or
such other Credit Party, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such other Credit Party for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender or such other Credit Party becomes entitled to claim
any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.  
 (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital or liquidity
requirements or in the interpretation, administration, implementation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital or liquidity requirements (whether
or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the First Amendment Effective Date shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such corporation s capital as a consequence of
its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender s or such corporation s policies with respect to
capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay
to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.    (c)
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar
authority) or by United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives
thereunder or issued in connection therewith or in implementation thereof, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented.  
 (d) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more
than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor;  provided  that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such
nine-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.  
      41  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.18 to the contrary, no Lender
shall be entitled to receive any compensation pursuant to this Section 2.18 unless it shall be the general policy or practice of such Lender to seek compensation from other similarly situated borrowers in the U.S. syndicated loan market with
respect to its similarly affected loans under agreements with such borrowers having provisions similar to this Section 2.18.    2.19
 Taxes . (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as
determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction
or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be
increased as necessary so that, after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.19), the amounts received with respect to this agreement
equal the sum which would have been received had no such deduction or withholding been made.    (b) The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.  
 (c) As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.19, such
Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.    (d) The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Credit Party, within
10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.19) payable or paid by such Credit Party or required to be
withheld or deducted from a payment to such Credit Party and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.    (e) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for
(i) any Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) and
(ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.6(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, in either case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in
connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount
of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such
Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).  
      42  

(f) (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with
respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject
to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 2.19(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would
materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.    (ii) Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person,      

(A) 
 any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;    

(B) 
 any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on
which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:    

(1) 
 in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form
W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan
Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or  other income  article of such tax treaty;    

(2) 
 executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;        

(3) 
   in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
Section 881(c)     
      43  

of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of
the Code, a  10 percent shareholder  of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a  controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a   U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate  ) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or        

(4) 
 to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in
the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;  provided  that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such
Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;    

(C) 
 any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on
which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis
for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the
withholding or deduction required to be made; and        

(D) 
   if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by
FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative     
      44  

Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s
obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date.    
 Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it
shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  
 (g) If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.19 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.19), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) ( plus  any penalties, interest or other charges
imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the
indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been
in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 2.19 shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information
relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.    (h) Each party s obligations under
this Section 2.19 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all
obligations under the Loan Documents.    2.20  Indemnity . The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender
harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender sustains or incurs as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice
requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount
of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or,
in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the
Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading
banks in the interbank eurodollar market. A certificate as to any amounts payable  
      45  

pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder for nine months.    2.21  Change of Lending Office . Each Lender agrees
that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.18 or 2.19(a) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender)
to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event;
 provided , that such designation or assignment is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending offices to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and  provided ,
 further , that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.18 or 2.19(a).  
 2.22  Replacement of Lenders . The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts
owing pursuant to Section 2.18 or 2.19(a) or (b) does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of each of the
Lenders or each of the Lenders affected thereby (so long as the consent of the Required Lenders has been obtained), with a replacement financial institution;  provided  that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of
Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.21 so as to eliminate the continued need
for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.18 or 2.19(a), (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement,
(v) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.20 if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the
replacement financial institution shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (provided that the
Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein), (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to
Section 2.18 or 2.19(a), as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender. Each party
hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee, and that the Lender required to make such assignment
need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective.    2.23  [Reserved] .  
 2.24  Incremental Facilities . (a) The Borrower and any one or more Lenders (including New Lenders) may from time to time agree that
such Lenders shall make, obtain or increase the amount of their Incremental Term Loans (which may be effected by increasing the amount of any then existing Facility) by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Term Loan
Activation Notice specifying (v) the amount of such Incremental Term Loans, (w) the applicable Incremental Term Loan Closing Date (which shall be a date not less than 10 Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the
Administrative Agent (or such earlier date as shall be agreed by the Administrative Agent)), (x) the applicable Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date, (y) the amortization schedule for such Incremental Term Loans and (z) the Applicable
Margin for such Incremental Term Loans;  provided , that (i) the aggregate amount of all Incremental Term Loans established on any date  
      46  

shall not exceed (x) an amount equal to the Base Incremental Amount on such date and (y) an additional amount subject to the Maximum Incremental Amount as of such date, (ii) each
Incremental Term Facility shall be in a minimum aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000, (iii) the Incremental Term Loans in respect of any Incremental Term Facility and all obligations in respect thereof shall be Obligations under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are (A) guaranteed on a pari passu basis with all of the other Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (B) secured by the Collateral (and no other property) and the
Liens on the Collateral securing such Incremental Term Loans and all other obligations in respect thereof shall be pari passu with the Liens on the Collateral securing all of the other Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
(iv) the Incremental Term Loans in respect of any Incremental Term Facility will be entitled to prepayments on the same basis as the Term B Loans unless the applicable Incremental Term Loan Activation Notice specifies a lesser treatment,
(v) such Incremental Term Loans shall have a final maturity no earlier than the Latest Maturity Date (determined immediately prior to incurrence of such Incremental Term Loans), (vi) the weighted average life to maturity of such
Incremental Term Facility shall be no shorter than that of any existing Term Loans (except if required in order to make such Incremental Term Loans fungible with any outstanding Term Loans), (vii) the all-in-yield (whether in the form of
interest rate margins, original issue discount, upfront fees or interest rate floors) and (subject to clauses (v) and (vi) above) amortization schedule applicable to such Incremental Term Facility shall be determined by the Borrower and
the Lenders providing such Incremental Term Facility,  provided   that , in the event that the all-in-yield for any Incremental Term Facility shall be more than 50 basis points higher than the corresponding all-in-yield for any then
existing Term B Loans as determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with standard market practices (after giving effect to interest rate margins, original issue discount, upfront fees or interest rate floors), then the all-in-yield with
respect to the outstanding Term B Loans shall be increased to the amount necessary so that the difference between the all-in-yield with respect to the Incremental Term Facility and the all-in-yield on the outstanding Term B Loans is equal to 50
basis points and (viii) to the extent that (subject to clauses (iv) through (vii) above) the terms of any Incremental Term Facility are not consistent with the terms of the Term B Facility, they shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. No Lender shall have any obligation to participate in any increase described in this paragraph unless it agrees to do so in its sole discretion.  
 (b) Any additional bank, financial institution or other entity which, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), elects to become a  Lender  under this Agreement in connection with any transaction described in Section 2.24(a) shall execute a New Lender Supplement (each, a   New Lender
Supplement  ), substantially in the form of Exhibit I-2, whereupon such bank, financial institution or other entity (a   New Lender  ) shall become a Lender for all purposes and to the same extent as if originally a party
hereto and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement.    (c) [Reserved].  
 (d) Each Incremental Term Loan Activation Notice may, without the consent of any Lender (other than the applicable Incremental Term Lenders)
effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to give effect to the provisions of this Section 2.24. This Section shall supersede any
provision of Section 10.1 to the contrary.    (e) It shall be a condition precedent to the availability of any Incremental Term Loans
that (i) no Default or Event of Default (or, in the case of any Incremental Acquisition Term Facility, no Event of Default under clauses (a) or (f) of Section 8) shall have occurred and be continuing immediately prior to and
immediately after giving effect to the making of such Incremental Term Loans, (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in each Loan Document (or, in the case of any Incremental  
      47

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth or referred to below, a Purchasing Borrower Party may from time to time, in its discretion, conduct modified Dutch auctions to make Auction Purchase Offers, each such Auction Purchase Offer to
be managed by an investment bank of recognized standing selected by the Borrower following consultation with the Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the   Auction Manager  ) and to be conducted in accordance with the procedures,
terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2.25 and the Auction Procedures, in each case, so long as the following conditions are satisfied:  
 (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of purchase of any Term Loans or on the
date of the delivery of each Auction Notice;    (ii) the assigning Lender and the Purchasing Borrower Party shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption;    (iii) the maximum principal amount (calculated on the
face amount thereof) of Term Loans that the Purchasing Borrower Party offers to purchase in any Auction Purchase Offer shall be no less than $10,000,000 (unless another amount is agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion);
   (iv) any Term Loans assigned to any Purchasing Borrower Party shall be automatically and permanently cancelled upon the
effectiveness of such assignment and will thereafter no longer be outstanding for any purpose hereunder, and such Term Loans may not be resold (it being understood and agreed that any gains or losses by any Purchasing Borrower Party upon purchase or
acquisition and cancellation of such Term Loans shall not be taken into account in the calculation of Excess Cash Flow, Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA);  
 (v) no more than one Auction Purchase Offer with respect to any Facility may be ongoing at any one time and no more than four
Auction Purchase Offers (regardless of Facility) may be made in any one year;    (vi) at the time of each purchase of Term
Loans through an Auction Purchase Offer, the Borrower shall have delivered to the Auction Manager a certificate of a Responsible Officer certifying as to compliance with the preceding clause (i);  
 (vii) no Purchasing Borrower Party may use the proceeds, directly or indirectly, from ABL Loans to purchase any Term Loans; and
   (viii) each Auction Purchase Officer shall be made to all Lenders of the applicable Facility subject to such Auction

      48  

(b) A Purchasing Borrower Party must terminate any Auction Purchase Offer if it fails to satisfy
one or more of the conditions set forth above which are required to be met at the time which otherwise would have been the time of purchase of Term Loans pursuant to such Auction Purchase Offer. If a Purchasing Borrower Party commences any Auction
Purchase Offer (and all relevant requirements set forth above which are required to be satisfied at the time of the commencement of such Auction Purchase Offer have in fact been satisfied), and if at such time of commencement the Purchasing Borrower
Party reasonably believes that all required conditions set forth above which are required to be satisfied at the time of the consummation of such Auction Purchase Offer shall be satisfied, then the Purchasing Borrower Party shall have no liability
to any Lender for any termination of such Auction Purchase Offer as a result of the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth above which are required to be met at the time which otherwise would have been the time of consummation of
such Auction Purchase Offer, and any such failure shall not result in any Default or Event of Default hereunder. With respect to all purchases of Term Loans of any Facility made by a Purchasing Borrower Party pursuant to this Section 2.25, the
Purchasing Borrower Party shall pay on the settlement date of each such purchase all accrued and unpaid interest (except to the extent otherwise set forth in the relevant offering documents), if any, on the purchased Term Loans of the applicable
Facility up to the settlement date of such purchase.    The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the Auction Purchase
Offers and the other transactions effected pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.25 (provided that no Lender shall have an obligation to participate in any such Auction Purchase Offer). For the avoidance of doubt, it is
understood and agreed that the provisions of Section 2.17 will not apply to the purchases of Term Loans pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.25. The Auction Manager acting in its capacity as such hereunder
shall be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of Article VIII and Article IX to the same extent as if each reference therein to the  Administrative Agent  were a reference to the Auction Manager, and the Administrative Agent shall
cooperate with the Auction Manager as reasonably requested by the Auction Manager in order to enable it to perform its responsibilities and duties in connection with each Auction Purchase Offer.  
 2.26  Loan Modification Offers . (a) The Borrower may on one or more occasions after the Closing Date, by written notice to the
Administrative Agent, make one or more offers (each, a   Loan Modification Offer  ) to all (and not fewer than all) the Lenders of one or more Facilities (each Facility subject to such a Loan Modification Offer, an   Affected
Facility  ) to make one or more Permitted Amendments pursuant to procedures reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Borrower. Such notice shall set forth (i) the terms and conditions of the
requested Loan Modification Offer and (ii) the date on which such Loan Modification Offer is requested to become effective. Permitted Amendments shall become effective only with respect to the Loans of the Lenders of the Affected Facility that
accept the applicable Loan Modification Offer (such Lenders, the   Accepting Lenders  ) and, in the case of any Accepting Lender, only with respect to such Lender s Loans and Commitments of such Affected Facility as to which such
Lender s acceptance has been made. With respect to all Permitted Amendments consummated by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.26, (i) such Permitted Amendments shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments
for purposes of Section 2.11 and (ii) any Loan Modification Offer, unless contemplating a scheduled maturity date already in effect with respect to any Loans hereunder pursuant to a previously consummated Permitted Amendment, must be in a
minimum amount of $25,000,000 (or such lesser amount as may be approved by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion);  provided  that the Borrower may at its election specify as a condition (a   Minimum Extension
Condition  ) to consummating any such Permitted Amendment that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Loan Modification Offer in the Borrower s sole discretion and which may be waived by the Borrower) of Loans
of any or all Affected Facilities be extended. If the aggregate principal amount of Loans of any Affected Facility in respect of which Lenders shall have accepted the relevant Loan Modification Offer shall exceed the
 
      49  

maximum aggregate principal amount of Loans of such Affected Facility offered to be extended by the Borrower pursuant to such Loan Modification Offer, then the Loans of such Lenders shall be
extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the relative principal amounts (but not to exceed actual holdings of record) with respect to which such Lenders have accepted such Loan Modification Offer.  
 (b) A Permitted Amendment shall be effected pursuant to a Loan Modification Agreement executed and delivered by the Borrower, each Accepting
Lender and the Administrative Agent;  provided  that no Permitted Amendment shall become effective unless (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of effectiveness thereof, (ii) on the date of
effectiveness thereof, the representations and warranties of each Loan Party set forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (or if qualified by materiality, in all respects), in each case on and as of such date,
except in the case of any such representation and warranty expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be so true and correct on and as of such earlier date, (iii) the Borrower shall have
delivered, or agreed to deliver by a date following the effectiveness of such Permitted Amendment reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to the Administrative Agent such legal opinions, board resolutions, secretary s certificates,
officer s certificates and other documents (including reaffirmation agreements, supplements and/or amendments to Mortgages or other Security Documents, in each case to the extent applicable) as shall reasonably be requested by the
Administrative Agent in connection therewith and (iv) any applicable Minimum Extension Condition shall be satisfied (unless waived by the Borrower). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Loan
Modification Agreement. Each Loan Modification Agreement may, without the consent of any Lender other than the applicable Accepting Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in
the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to give effect to the provisions of this Section 2.26, including any amendments necessary to treat the applicable Loans of the Accepting Lenders as a new Facility of loans hereunder (and the
Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any such amendments);  provided  that (i) all prepayments of Loans (i.e., both extended and non-extended) shall continue to be made on a ratable basis among all
Lenders, based on the relative amounts of their Loans unless a Permitted Amendment provides for lesser treatment of the Loans of the Accepting Lenders, until the repayment of the non-extended Loans on the relevant scheduled maturity date in respect
thereof. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby acknowledge that in respect of payments on non-extended Loans on the scheduled maturity date in respect thereof the pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement are not
intended to apply to the transactions effected pursuant to this Section 2.26. This Section 2.26 shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.17 or Section 10.1 to the contrary.

 SECTION 9. THE AGENTS    9.1
 Appointment . Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent,
in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.    9.2  Delegation of Duties . The Administrative Agent may execute any
of its duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible
for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.    9.3  Exculpatory
Provisions . No Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan  
      86  

Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person s
(respectively) own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value,
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party a party thereto to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be under
any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any
Loan Party.    9.4  Reliance by Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected
in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, facsimile or e-mail message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed,
sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and
treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or
it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.    9.5  Notice of Default .
The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing
such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a  notice of default . In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders);  provided  that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable
in the best interests of the Lenders.    9.6  Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders . Each Lender expressly acknowledges that none
of the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the
affairs of a Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or
any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties
and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans  
      87  

hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems
necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to
the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys-in-fact or
affiliates.    9.7  Indemnification . The Lenders agree to severally indemnify each Agent and its officers, directors, employees,
affiliates, agents, advisors and controlling persons (each, an   Agent Indemnitee  ) (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective
Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full,
ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other
Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent Indemnitee under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
 provided  that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent Indemnitee s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and
all other amounts payable hereunder.    9.8  Agent in Its Individual Capacity . Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept
deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms  Lender  and  Lenders  shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.  
 9.9  Successor Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days  notice to the
Lenders and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which
successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(a) or Section 8(f) with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term  Administrative Agent  shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and
approval, and the former Administrative Agent s rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this
Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as  
      88  

Administrative Agent by the date that is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent s resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. After any retiring
Administrative Agent s resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 and of Section 10.5 shall continue to inure to its benefit.  
 9.10  Arranger, Syndication Agent and Documentation Agents . None of the Arranger, the Syndication Agent or the Documentation Agents
shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in their respective capacities as such.    SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS

affected Facility) and (y) that any amendment or modification of defined terms used in the financial covenants in this Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (i)) or extend the
scheduled date of any payment thereof, or increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lender s Commitment, in each case without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; (ii) eliminate or reduce the voting
rights of any Lender under this Section 10.1 without the written consent of such Lender; (iii) reduce any percentage specified in the definition of  Required Lenders  without the written consent of each Lender, reduce any

each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section.
   (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an
  Assignee  ), all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent of:  
      93  

(A) 
 the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld),  provided  that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund (as defined below)
or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other Person; and  provided ,  further , that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless the Borrower shall object thereto by written notice
to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice thereof; and        

(B) 
 the Administrative Agent,  provided  that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of all or any portion of a Term Loan to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.
     (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:  

(A) 
 except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Commitments or Loans under any Facility, the
amount of the Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
$1,000,000) unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent,  provided  that (1) no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (2) such amounts
shall be aggregated in respect of each Lender and its affiliates or Approved Funds, if any;        

(B) 
 (1) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 and (2) the assigning Lender shall
have paid in full any amounts owing by it to the Administrative Agent; and        

(C) 
 the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire in which the Assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information
(which may contain material non-public information about the Borrower and its Affiliates and their related parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the Assignee s
compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws.      For the purposes of this
Section 10.6,   Approved Fund   means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and
that is administered or managed by (a) a  
      94  

Lender, (b) an affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.  
 (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) below, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the
assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning
Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.18, 2.19, 2.20 and 10.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of
this Section.    (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of
its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the   Register  ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.    (v) Upon
its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignee s completed administrative questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and
recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the
information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as  provided  in this paragraph.  
 (c) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more Eligible Assignees (a
  Participant  ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it);  provided  that (i) such Lender s
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender
shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;  provided  that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (i) requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 10.1 and (ii) directly affects such
Participant. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with  
      95  

the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.22 with respect to any Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.18, 2.19
and 2.20 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.19(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.19(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section;  provided  that such Participant (i) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.18 and 2.19 as if
it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (ii) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.18 or 2.19, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to
receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from an adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the Closing Date that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. To the extent permitted by law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.7(b) as though it were a Lender,  provided  such Participant shall be subject to Section 10.7(a) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation
shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in
the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the   Participant Register    provided  that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the
identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such
Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as
Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.    (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign
a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central banking authority, and this
Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;  provided  that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or
Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in this paragraph (d).  
 (e) Any Lender may, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and no proceeds of ABL Loans are used, directly or
indirectly, to fund the consideration for any such assignment, at any time assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations with respect to Term Loans under a Facility under this Agreement to the Borrower through (x) Dutch auctions open to
all Lenders under such Facility on a pro rata basis in accordance with Section 2.25 or (y) notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, open market purchases on a non pro rata basis;  provided  that, in connection with
assignments pursuant to clause (y) above, (A) at the time of any such assignment, the Borrower shall make a No Undisclosed Information Representation, (B) any Term Loans assigned to the Borrower shall be automatically and permanently
cancelled upon the effectiveness of such assignment and will thereafter no longer be outstanding for any purpose hereunder, and such Term Loans may not be resold (it being understood and agreed that any gains or losses by the Borrower upon purchase
or acquisition and cancellation of such Term Loans shall not be taken into account in the calculation of Excess Cash Flow, Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA) and (C) the Borrower shall
 
      96  

promptly provide notice to the Administrative Agent of such assignment of such Term Loans and the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such notice, shall reflect the cancellation of the
applicable Term Loans in the Register.    (f) The list of Disqualified Lenders (i) shall be made available to the Lenders by posting on
IntraLinks/IntraAgency or another relevant Internet or intranet website, if any, to which each Lender and the Administrative Agent have access (whether a commercial, third-party website or whether sponsored by the Administrative Agent) and
(ii) shall be provided to any Lender upon request by such Lender to the Administrative Agent. A Lender may provide the list of Disqualified Lenders to any potential assignee or participant on a confidential basis in accordance with
Section 10.15 hereof for the purpose of verifying whether such Person is a Disqualified Lender.    10.7  Adjustments; Set-off .
(a) Except to the extent that this Agreement or a court order expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the Lenders under a particular Facility, if any Lender (a   Benefitted Lender  ) shall
receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it (other than in connection with an assignment made pursuant to Section 10.6), or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off,
pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 8(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations owing to such other
Lender, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral,
as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders;  provided ,  however , that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is
thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.  
 (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without notice to the Borrower,
any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any Obligations becoming due and payable by the Borrower (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to apply to the payment
of such Obligations, by setoff or otherwise, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect,
absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender, any affiliate thereof or any of their respective branches or agencies to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such application made by such Lender,  provided  that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such application.

jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable
such provision in any other jurisdiction.

Lender when added (after giving effect to any application of proceeds of such Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.6) to the sum of (x) such Lender s Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations then outstanding, (y) such
Lender s Swingline Exposure then outstanding and (z) such Lender s Protective Advance Exposure then outstanding, exceeding the amount of such Lender s Commitment or (ii) the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit exceeding the

Administrative Agent by the Revolving Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.    2.3  Protective Advances .
(a) Subject to the limitations set forth below, the Administrative Agent is authorized by the Borrower and the Lenders, from time to time in the Administrative Agent s Permitted Discretion (but shall have absolutely no obligation to), to
make Loans to the Borrower, on behalf of all Lenders, which the Administrative Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (i) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, (ii) to enhance the
likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loans and other Obligations, or (iii) to pay any other amount chargeable to or required to be paid by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including payments of
reimbursable expenses (including costs, fees, and expenses as described in Section 10.5) and other sums payable under the Loan Documents (any of such Loans are herein referred to as   Protective Advances    provided  that,
as of the date of the making of any Protective Advance, the aggregate amount of outstanding Protective Advances shall not exceed 10% of the Commitments outstanding as of such date;  provided further  that the Total Revolving Extensions of
Credit outstanding any time shall not exceed the Total Commitments. Protective Advances may be made even if the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 have not been satisfied. The Protective Advances shall be secured by the Liens in
favor of the Administrative Agent in and to the Collateral and shall constitute Obligations hereunder. All Protective Advances shall be ABR Loans. The Administrative Agent s authorization to make Protective Advances may be revoked at any time
by the Required Lenders. Any such revocation must be in writing and shall become effective prospectively upon the Administrative Agent s receipt thereof. At any time (a) the amount equal to (i) the lesser of (x) the Total
Commitments and (y) the Borrowing Limit  minus  (ii) the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit then outstanding (calculated, with respect to any Defaulting Lender, as if such Defaulting Lender had funded its Revolving Percentage of all
outstanding Revolving Loans) exceeds the amount of any Protective Advance and (b) the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 have been satisfied, the Administrative Agent may request the Revolving Lenders to make a Revolving Loan to
repay a Protective Advance. At any other time the Administrative Agent may require the Lenders to fund their risk participations described in Section 2.3(b).  
 (b) Upon the making of a Protective Advance by the Administrative Agent (whether before or after the occurrence of a Default), each Lender
shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the Administrative Agent, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in such Protective Advance in
proportion to its Revolving Percentage. From and after the date, if any, on which any Lender is required to fund its participation in any Protective Advance purchased hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to such Lender such
Lender s Revolving Percentage of all payments of principal and interest and all proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent in respect of such Protective Advance (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to
reflect the period of time during which such Lender s participating interest was outstanding and funded and, in the case of principal and interest payments, to reflect such Lender s pro rata portion of such payment if such payment is not
sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on all Protective Advances then due).    2.4  [Reserved] .  
      43  

2.5  [Reserved] .  
 2.6  Swingline Commitment . (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, from time to time during the Revolving Commitment
Period, the Swingline Lender agrees to make a portion of the credit otherwise available to the Borrower under the Commitments by making swing line loans ( Swingline Loans ) to the Borrower;  provided  that (i) the sum of
(w) the Swingline Exposure of the Swingline Lender (in its capacity as the Swingline Lender and a Revolving Lender), (x) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans made by the Swingline Lender (in its capacity as a
Revolving Lender), (y) the L/C Exposure of the Swingline Lender (in its capacity as a Revolving Lender) and (z) the Protective Advance Exposure of the Swingline Lender (in its capacity as a Revolving Lender) shall not exceed its Commitment
then in effect, (ii) the sum of the outstanding Swingline Loans shall not exceed the Swingline Commitment and (iii) the Borrower shall not request, and the Swingline Lender shall not make, any Swingline Loan if, after giving effect to the
making of such Swingline Loan, the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit would exceed the lesser of (x) the Total Commitments and (y) the Borrowing Limit, subject to the authority of the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, to make
Protective Advances pursuant to the terms of Section 2.3. During the Revolving Commitment Period, the Borrower may use the Swingline Commitment by borrowing, repaying and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.
Swingline Loans shall be ABR Loans only.    (b) The Borrower shall repay to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each
Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Revolving Termination Date and five Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made;  provided  that on each date that a Revolving Loan is borrowed, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then
outstanding and the proceeds of any such Revolving Loans shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to repay any Swingline Loans outstanding.  
 2.7  Procedure for Swingline Borrowing; Refunding of Swingline Loans . (a) Whenever the Borrower desires that the Swingline Lender
make a Swingline Loan it shall give the Swingline Lender irrevocable telephonic notice confirmed promptly in writing (which telephonic notice must be received by the Swingline Lender not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the proposed
Borrowing Date), specifying (i) the amount to be borrowed and (ii) the requested Borrowing Date (which shall be a Business Day during the Revolving Commitment Period). Each borrowing under the Swingline Commitment shall be in an amount
equal to $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Not later than 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Borrowing Date specified in a notice in respect of Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender shall make available to the
Administrative Agent at the Funding Office an amount in immediately available funds equal to the amount of the Swingline Loan to be made by the Swingline Lender. The Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of such Swingline Loan available to
the Borrower on such Borrowing Date by depositing such proceeds in the account of the Borrower with the Administrative Agent on such Borrowing Date in immediately available funds.  
 (b) [Reserved].    (c) The
Swingline Lender, at any time and from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion may, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably directs the Swingline Lender to act on its behalf), on one Business Day s notice given by the
Swingline Lender no later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, request each Revolving Lender to make, and each Revolving Lender hereby agrees to make, a Revolving Loan, in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender s Revolving Percentage of the
aggregate amount of the Swingline Loans (the  Refunded Swingline Loans ) outstanding on the date of such notice, to repay the Swingline Lender. Each Revolving Lender shall make the amount of such Revolving Loan available to the
Administrative Agent at the Funding Office in immediately available funds, not later than 10:00 A.M., New York City time, one Business Day after the date of such notice. The proceeds of such Revolving Loans shall be immediately made available by
 
      44

to charge the Borrower s accounts with the Administrative Agent (up to the amount available in each such account) in order to immediately pay the amount of such Refunded Swingline Loans to the extent amounts received from the Revolving Lenders
are not sufficient to repay in full such Refunded Swingline Loans.    (d) If prior to the time a Revolving Loan would have otherwise been
made pursuant to Section 2.7(c), one of the events described in Section 8(f) shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Borrower or if for any other reason, as determined by the Swingline Lender in its sole discretion,
Revolving Loans may not be made as contemplated by Section 2.7(c), each Revolving Lender shall, on the date such Revolving Loan was to have been made pursuant to the notice referred to in Section 2.7(c), purchase for cash an undivided
participating interest in the then outstanding Swingline Loans by paying to the Swingline Lender an amount (the  Swingline Participation Amount ) equal to (i) such Revolving Lender s Revolving Percentage times (ii) the sum
of the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding that were to have been repaid with such Revolving Loans.    (e)
Whenever, at any time after the Swingline Lender has received from any Revolving Lender such Lender s Swingline Participation Amount, the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of the Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender will
distribute to such Lender its ratable portion of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender s participating interest was outstanding and funded and, in the case
of principal and interest payments, to reflect such Lender s pro rata portion of such payment if such payment is not sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on all Swingline Loans then due); provided, however, that in the event that
such payment received by the Swingline Lender is required to be returned, such Revolving Lender will return to the Swingline Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by the Swingline Lender.  
 (f) Each Revolving Lender s obligation to make the Loans referred to in Section 2.7(c) and to purchase participating interests
pursuant to Section 2.7(d) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Revolving Lender or the Borrower may have
against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5,
(iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Revolving Lender or (v) any other

Eurodollar Rate, as applicable, for a Loan for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest
Period,    the Administrative Agent shall give facsimile or e-mail notice thereof to the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable
thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period

Credit which have been cash collateralized in accordance with the foregoing) shall be paid over to the applicable Loan Party at its account designated for such purpose by written notice by such Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or to whomsoever
else may be lawfully entitled to receive the same. The application of any payment pursuant to this Section 2.17(b) shall be made  first , to ABR Loans and  second , to Eurodollar Loans. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders

day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on
the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. During any Full Cash
Dominion Period, solely for purposes of determining the amount of Loans available for borrowing purposes, checks (in addition to immediately available funds applied pursuant to Section 2.11(c)) from collections of items of payment and proceeds
of any Collateral shall be applied in whole or in part against the applicable Obligations as of 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the Business Day of receipt, subject to actual collection.  
 (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the
amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the New York Fed Bank Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender s share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be
entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans, on demand, from the Borrower.  
 (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the
Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective  pro   rata  shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average New
York Fed Bank Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.    (g)
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.7(c), 2.7(d), 2.17(e), 2.17(f), 2.19(e), 3.4(a) or 9.7, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision
hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the  
      50  

Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations to it under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or
(ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as
determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.    2.18  Requirements of Law . (a) If the adoption of or any change in
any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation, administration, implementation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender or other Credit Party with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority, in each case made or occurring subsequent to the Closing Date:    (i) shall subject any Credit
Party to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit,
commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;    (ii)
shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of
credit (or participations therein) by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or  
 (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition (other than Taxes);  
 and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Credit Party, by an amount that such Lender or other Credit Party
deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly
pay such Lender or such other Credit Party, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such other Credit Party for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender or such other Credit Party becomes
entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.  
 (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital or liquidity
requirements or in the interpretation, administration, implementation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital or liquidity requirements (whether
or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the Closing Date shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such corporation s capital as a consequence of its obligations
hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender s or such
corporation s policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a
written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.  
      51  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) all requests, rules, guidelines,
requirements and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or by United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to
Basel III, and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith or in implementation thereof, shall in each case be
deemed to be a change in law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented.    (d) A certificate as to any additional
amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower
shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor;
 provided  that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such nine-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.    (e) Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Section 2.18 to the contrary, no Lender shall be entitled to receive any compensation pursuant to this Section 2.18 unless it shall be the general policy or practice of such Lender to seek compensation from
other similarly situated borrowers in the U.S. syndicated loan market with respect to its similarly affected loans under agreements with such borrowers having provisions similar to this Section 2.18.  
 2.19  Taxes . (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made
without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any
such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.19), the amounts received with respect to this agreement equal the sum which would have been received had no such deduction or withholding been made.  
 (b) The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the
Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.    (c) As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a
Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.19, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return
reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.    (d) The Loan Parties shall
jointly and severally indemnify each Credit Party, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section 2.19) payable or paid by such Credit Party or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Credit Party and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
 
      52  

Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  
 (e) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Taxes attributable
to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) and (ii) any Taxes attributable to such
Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.6(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, in either case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to
any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise
payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).  
 (f) (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or
information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.19(f)(ii)(A),
(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or
commercial position of such Lender.    (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower
is a U.S. Person,      

(A) 
 any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;    

(B) 
   any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter
    
      53  

upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:    

(1) 
 in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form
W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan
Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or  other income  article of such tax treaty;    

(2) 
 executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;        

(3) 
 in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that
such Non-U.S. Lender is not a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a  10 percent shareholder  of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a  controlled
foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a   U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate  ) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or    

(4) 
 to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in
the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;  provided  that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such
Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;    

(C) 
   any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the
Borrower or the     
      54  

Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed,
together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and    

(D) 
 if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA
(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested
by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the
amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date.    
 Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it
shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  
 (g) If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.19 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.19), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) ( plus  any penalties, interest or other charges
imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the
indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been
in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 2.19 shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information
relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.  
      55  

(h) Each party s obligations under this Section 2.19 shall survive the resignation or
replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under the Loan Documents.  
 (i) For purposes of this Section 2.19, the term  Lender  includes the Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender.  
 2.20  Indemnity . The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such
Lender sustains or incurs as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a
prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the
amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert
or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over
(ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. A
certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans
and all other amounts payable hereunder for nine months.    2.21  Change of Lending Office . Each Lender agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.18 or 2.19(a) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate
another lending office for any Loans affected by such event or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event;  provided ,
that such designation or assignment is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending offices to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and  provided ,  further , that
nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.18 or 2.19(a).  
 2.22  Replacement of Lenders . The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts
owing pursuant to Section 2.18 or 2.19(a), (b) becomes a Defaulting Lender or (c) does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
that requires the consent of each of the Lenders or each of the Lenders affected thereby (so long as the consent of the Required Lenders has been obtained), with a replacement financial institution;  provided  that (i) such replacement
does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under
Section 2.21 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.18 or 2.19(a), (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced
Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.20 if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such  
      56  

replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee
referred to therein), (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.18 or 2.19(a), as the case may be, and (ix) any such
replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may
be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee, and that the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective.
   2.23  Defaulting Lenders . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:    (a) fees shall cease to accrue on the
unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.8(a);    (b) the Commitment and Revolving Extensions
of Credit of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.1);
 provided , that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby;  
 (c) if any Swingline Exposure, L/C Exposure or Protective Advance Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
   (i) all or any part of the Swingline Exposure, L/C Exposure and Protective Advance Exposure of such Defaulting Lender
(other than the portion of such Swingline Exposure referred to in clause (b) of the definition of such term) shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Percentages but only to the extent
the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders  Revolving Extensions of Credit  plus  such Defaulting Lender s Swingline Exposure, L/C Exposure and Protective Advance Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders 
Commitments;    (ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the
Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x)  first , prepay such Protective Advance Exposure, (y)  second , prepay such Swingline Exposure and (z)  third , cash collateralize
for the benefit of the Issuing Lender only the Borrower s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender s L/C Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 8 for so long as such L/C Exposure is outstanding;    (iii) if the Borrower cash
collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender s L/C Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.3(a) with respect to such
 
      57  

Defaulting Lender s L/C Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender s L/C Exposure is cash collateralized;  
 (iv) if the L/C Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable
to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.8(a) and Section 3.3(a) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders  Revolving Percentages; and  
 (v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender s L/C Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant
to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all fees payable under Section 3.3(a) with respect to such Defaulting Lender s L/C Exposure shall
be payable to the Issuing Lender until and to the extent that such L/C Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and    (d) so long
as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related
exposure and the Defaulting Lender s then outstanding L/C Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be  provided  by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.23(c), and
participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.23(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not
participate therein).    If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Lender Parent of any Lender shall occur following the Closing Date
and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Lender has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits
to extend credit, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may
be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.  
 In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has
adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure, L/C Exposure and Protective Advance Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender s Commitment
and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its
Revolving Percentage.    2.24  Incremental Facilities . (a) The Borrower and any one or more Lenders (including New Lenders) may
from time to time agree that such Lenders shall make, obtain or increase the amount of their Commitments (any such new or increased Commitments,   Incremental Commitments  ) by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent an
Increased Facility Activation Notice specifying (x) the amount of such Incremental Commitments and (y) the applicable Increased Facility Closing Date (which shall be a date not less than 10 Business Days after the date on which such notice
is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such earlier date as shall be agreed by the Administrative Agent));  provided  that (i) with respect to any Increased Facility Closing Date, the Incremental Commitments shall be in a minimum
amount of $10,000,000, (ii) the aggregate amount of Incremental Commitments obtained after the Closing Date pursuant to this Section 2.24 shall not exceed  
      58  

$50,000,000 and (iii) Incremental Commitments may be made no more than two times during the term of this Agreement (or such greater number as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its
sole discretion). No Lender shall have any obligation to participate in any increase described in this paragraph unless it agrees to do so in its sole discretion.  
 (b) Any additional bank, financial institution or other entity which, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), elects to become a  Lender  under this Agreement in connection with any transaction described in Section 2.24(a) shall execute a New Lender Supplement (each, a   New Lender
Supplement  ), substantially in the form of Exhibit I-2, whereupon such bank, financial institution or other entity (a   New Lender  ) shall become a Lender for all purposes and to the same extent as if originally a party
hereto and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement.    (c) Unless otherwise agreed or otherwise directed by the
Administrative Agent, on each Increased Facility Closing Date, the Borrower shall borrow Revolving Loans under the relevant Incremental Commitments from each Lender participating in the relevant increase in an amount determined by reference to the
amount of each Type of Loan (and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, of each Eurodollar Tranche) which would then have been outstanding from such Lender if (i) each such Type or Eurodollar Tranche had been borrowed or effected on such Increased
Facility Closing Date and (ii) the aggregate amount of each such Type or Eurodollar Tranche requested to be so borrowed or effected had been proportionately increased. The Eurodollar Base Rate applicable to any Eurodollar Loan borrowed pursuant
to the preceding sentence shall equal the Eurodollar Base Rate then applicable to the Eurodollar Loans of the other Lenders in the same Eurodollar Tranche (or, until the expiration of the then-current Interest Period, such other rate as shall be

Revolving Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue letters of credit (  Letters of Credit  ) for the account of the Borrower on any Business Day during the Revolving Commitment Period in such form as may be approved
from time to time by the Issuing Lender; provided that the Issuing Lender shall not issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment or (ii) the Total Revolving
Extensions of Credit would exceed the lesser of the Total Commitments and the Borrowing Limit, subject to the authority of the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, to make Protective Advances pursuant to the terms of Section 2.3. Each

      59  

Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date, provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event
extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above).    (b) The Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to issue any
Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law.  
 (c) The parties hereto agree that the Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit for all purposes under this Agreement,
without any further action by the Borrower, the Issuing Lender or any other Person.    3.2  Procedure for Issuance of Letter of
Credit . The Borrower may from time to time request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt of any Application, the Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and
other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender be required to issue any
Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the
beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. The Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrower promptly following the issuance thereof. The Issuing Lender shall promptly
furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof).  
 3.3  Fees and Other Charges . (a) The Borrower will pay a fee on all outstanding Letters of Credit at a per annum rate equal to the
Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Revolving Loans that are Eurodollar Loans, shared ratably among the Revolving Lenders and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. In addition, the Borrower shall
pay to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum on the undrawn and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.  
 (b) In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse the Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses
as are incurred or charged by the Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit.  
 3.4  L/C Participations . (a) The Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to
induce the Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C
Participant s own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant s Revolving Percentage in the Issuing Lender s obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amount of each draft
paid by the Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement (or in the event that any reimbursement received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by it at any time), such L/C Participant shall pay to the  
      60  

Issuing Lender upon demand at the Issuing Lender s address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant s Revolving Percentage of the amount that is not so
reimbursed (or is so returned). Each L/C Participant s obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other
right that such L/C Participant may have against the Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other
conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other L/C
Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.    (b) If any
amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to the Issuing Lender within
three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during the
period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and
the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment
is due, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans. A certificate of
the Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  
 (c) Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its
 pro   rata  share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), the Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied
thereto by the Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, the Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its  pro   rata  share thereof;  provided ,  however , that in the event that any such
payment received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by the Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by the Issuing Lender to it.  
 3.5  Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower . If any draft is paid under any Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing
Lender for the amount of (a) the draft so paid and (b) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment, not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on (i) the
Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such draft, if such notice is received on such day prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, or (ii) if clause (i) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following the day that
the Borrower receives such notice. Each such payment shall be made to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices referred to herein in Dollars and in immediately available funds. Interest shall be payable on any such amounts from the date on
which the relevant draft is paid until payment in full at the rate set forth in (x) until the Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant notice, Section 2.14(b) and (y) thereafter, Section 2.14(c).  
 3.6  Obligations Absolute . The Borrower s obligations under this Section 3 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable
under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Lender,  
      61  

any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person. The Borrower also agrees with the Issuing Lender that the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower s
Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (b) any draft or other
document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be invalid, fraudulent or forged in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (c) any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any
Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee, (d) payment by the Issuing Lender under a
Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (e) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but
for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower s obligations hereunder. The Issuing Lender shall not have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or
delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms
or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender;  provided  that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Lender s failure to exercise
care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing
Lender (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree
that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.  
 3.7  Letter of Credit Payments . If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation
expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity with such Letter of
Credit.    3.8  Applications . To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with
the provisions of this Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply.    SECTION 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.    9.2  Delegation of Duties . The Administrative Agent may execute any
of its duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall  
      100

attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.    9.3  Exculpatory Provisions . No Agent nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except
to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person s (respectively) own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or
(ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party a party thereto to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party.  
 9.4  Reliance by Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon
any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, facsimile or e-mail message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by
the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee
of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to
take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting,
or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.    9.5  Notice of Default . The
Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such
Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a  notice of default . In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative
Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders);  provided  that unless and until the Administrative
Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the Lenders.    9.6  Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders . (a) Each Lender expressly acknowledges that none of
the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,  
      101  

advisors, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or
any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates
and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise),
prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.  
 (b) Each Lender hereby agrees that (a) it has requested a copy of each Report prepared by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent;
(b) the Administrative Agent (i) makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the completeness or accuracy of any Report or any of the information contained therein or any inaccuracy or omission contained in or relating
to a Report and (ii) shall not be liable for any information contained in any Report; (c) the Reports are not comprehensive audits or examinations, and that any Person performing any field examination will inspect only specific information
regarding the Loan Parties and will rely significantly upon the Loan Parties  books and records, as well as on representations of the Loan Parties  personnel and that the Administrative Agent undertakes no obligation to update, correct or
supplement the Reports; (d) it will keep all Reports confidential and strictly for its internal use and not share the Report with any Loan Party or any other Person except as otherwise permitted pursuant to this Agreement; and (e) without
limiting the generality of any other indemnification provision contained in this Agreement, it will pay and protect, and severally indemnify, defend, and hold the Administrative Agent and any such other Person preparing a Report harmless from
and against, the claims, actions, proceedings, damages, costs, expenses, and other amounts (including reasonable attorney fees) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such other Person as the direct or indirect result of any third parties who might
obtain all or part of any Report through the indemnifying Lender.    9.7  Indemnification . The Lenders agree to severally indemnify
each Agent and its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents, advisors and controlling persons (each, an   Agent Indemnitee  ) (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower
to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have
terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising
out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent Indemnitee
under or in connection with any of the foregoing;  
      102  

provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent Indemnitee s gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  
 9.8  Agent in Its Individual Capacity . Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any
kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter of Credit issued or participated in by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms  Lender  and  Lenders  shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.  
 9.9  Successor Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days  notice to the
Lenders and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which
successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(a) or Section 8(f) with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term  Administrative Agent  shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and
approval, and the former Administrative Agent s rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this
Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative
Agent s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as
provided for above. After any retiring Administrative Agent s resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 and of Section 10.5 shall continue to inure to its benefit.  
 9.10  Arranger, Syndication Agent and Documentation Agents . None of the Arranger, the Syndication Agent or the Documentation Agents
shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in their respective capacities as such.    SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS  
 10.1  Amendments and Waivers . Neither this Agreement, any other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended,
supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.1. The Required Lenders and each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may, or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative
Agent and each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may, from time to time, (a) enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Loan Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Loan Parties hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the case
may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences;  provided ,  however , that no such waiver and no such amendment,
supplement or modification shall (i) forgive the principal amount or extend the final scheduled date of maturity of any Loan, reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder (except (x) in
 
      103  

connection with the waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates (which waiver shall be effective with the consent of the Required Lenders) and (y) that any
amendment or modification of defined terms used in the financial covenants in this Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (i)) or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof, or
increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lender s Commitment, in each case without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; (ii) eliminate or reduce the voting rights of any Lender under this
Section 10.1 without the written consent of such Lender; (iii) reduce any percentage specified in the definition of  Required Lenders  or  Supermajority Lenders  without the written consent of each Lender or change any
other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or otherwise modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder without the
written consent of each Lender, (iv) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, release all or substantially all of the Collateral or release all

affected Lender and, if necessary, one firm of local counsel in any relevant local jurisdiction (which may include a single special counsel acting in multiple jurisdictions) for such affected Lender and one firm of special regulatory counsel for
such affected Lender, (c) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender, the Issuing Lender, the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent harmless from, any and all recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect to, or
resulting from any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other Taxes, if any, that may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or consummation or administration of any of the transactions contemplated

persons) or (y) a material breach in bad faith by such Indemnitee of its obligations under the Loan Documents pursuant to a claim initiated by the Borrower. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any indirect, special, exemplary, punitive or

attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section.  
 (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an
  Assignee  ), all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent of:  

(A) 
 the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld),  provided  that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund (as defined below)
or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other Person; and  provided ,  further , that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless the Borrower shall object thereto by written notice
to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice thereof;        

(B) 
 the Administrative Agent;        

(C) 
 the Swingline Lender; and        

(D) 
 the Issuing Lender.      (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following
additional conditions:      

(A) 
 except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Commitments or Loans, the amount of the
Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000) unless
each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent,  provided  that (1) no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (2) such amounts shall be aggregated
in respect of each Lender and its affiliates or Approved Funds, if any;        

(B) 
 (1) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 and (2) the assigning Lender shall
have paid in full any amounts owing by it to the Administrative Agent; and        

(C) 
   the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative
questionnaire in which the Assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all     
      108  

syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Borrower and its Affiliates and their related parties or their respective securities) will be made
available and who may receive such information in accordance with the Assignee s compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws.    
 For the purposes of this Section 10.6,   Approved Fund   means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in
making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an
affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.    (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b)(iv) below, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.18, 2.19, 2.20 and 10.5).
Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.    (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose
as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount
(and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing, to each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the   Register  ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  
 (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the
Assignee s completed administrative questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment
required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as  provided  in this paragraph.    (c) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more Eligible Assignees (a   Participant  ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and
the Loans owing to it);  provided  that (i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall  
      109  

remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;  provided  that such agreement may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (i) requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 10.1
and (ii) directly affects such Participant. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.22
with respect to any Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.18, 2.19 and 2.20 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.19(f)
(it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.19(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of
this Section;  provided  that such Participant (i) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.18 and 2.19 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (ii) shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Sections 2.18 or 2.19, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from an adoption of or any
change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent
to the Closing Date that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.7(b) as though it were a Lender,  provided 
such Participant shall be subject to Section 10.7(a) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the
name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the   Participant Register    provided  that
no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters
of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of
the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation
for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  
 (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central banking authority, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
 provided  that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. The Borrower, upon receipt of written
notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in this paragraph (d).  
 (e) [Reserved].  
      110  

(f) The list of Disqualified Lenders (i) shall be made available to the Lenders by posting
on IntraLinks/IntraAgency or another relevant Internet or intranet website, if any, to which each Lender and the Administrative Agent have access (whether a commercial, third-party website or whether sponsored by the Administrative Agent) and
(ii) shall be provided to any Lender upon request by such Lender to the Administrative Agent. A Lender may provide the list of Disqualified Lenders to any potential assignee or participant on a confidential basis in accordance with
Section 10.15 hereof for the purpose of verifying whether such Person is a Disqualified Lender.    10.7  Adjustments; Set-off .
(a) Except to the extent that this Agreement or a court order expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender, if any Lender (a   Benefitted Lender  ) shall receive any payment of all or part of the
Obligations owing to it (other than in connection with an assignment made pursuant to Section 10.6), or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Section 8(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations owing to such other Lender, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for
cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted
Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders;  provided ,  however , that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender,
such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest;  provided further , that to the extent prohibited by applicable law as described in the definition of
 Excluded Swap Obligation,  no amounts received from, or set off with respect to, any Guarantor shall be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Guarantor.  
 (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without notice to the Borrower,
any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any Obligations becoming due and payable by the Borrower (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to apply to the payment
of such Obligations, by setoff or otherwise, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect,
absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender, any affiliate thereof or any of their respective branches or agencies to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower;  provided  that if any Defaulting
Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff (i) all amounts so set-off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and, pending such payment, shall be
segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Swingline Lender and the Lenders and (ii) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to
the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of set-off. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
after any such application made by such Lender,  provided  that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such application.

manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.    10.10  Integration . This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents represent the entire agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative

(other than indemnification or reimbursement obligations under Sections 2.18, 2.19(a), 2.19(d) or 2.20 for which the Borrower has not been notified and contingent indemnification obligations, Banking Services Obligations and Secured Swap
Obligations) shall have been paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated and no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding (other than Letters of Credit cash collateralized or otherwise backstopped in a manner satisfactory to the applicable
Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent), the Collateral shall be released from the Liens created by the Security Documents, and the Security Documents and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the
Administrative Agent and each Loan Party under the Security Documents shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any Person. In connection with any termination or release pursuant to this clause (b), the
Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to any Loan Party, at such Loan Party s expense, all documents that such Loan Party shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release.  
 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably
authorized by each Lender (without  
      113  

requirement of notice to or consent of any Lender except as expressly required by Section 10.1) to take any action requested by the Borrower having the effect of releasing any Collateral or
guarantee obligations (i) to the extent necessary to permit consummation of any transaction not prohibited by any Loan Document or that has been consented to in accordance with Section 10.1 or (ii) under the circumstances described in
paragraphs (a) or (b) above.    10.15  Confidentiality . Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees to keep
confidential all non-public information provided to it by any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement that is designated by the provider thereof as confidential;  provided  that
nothing herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent or any Lender from disclosing any such information (a) to the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or any affiliate thereof, (b) subject to an agreement to comply with the provisions
of this Section, to any actual or prospective Transferee or any direct or indirect counterparty to any Swap Agreement (or any professional advisor to such counterparty), (c) to its employees, directors, agents, attorneys, accountants and other
professional advisors or those of any of its affiliates, (d) upon the request or demand of any Governmental Authority, (e) in response to any order of any court or other Governmental Authority or as may otherwise be required pursuant to
any Requirement of Law, (f) if requested or required to do so in connection with any litigation or similar proceeding, (g) that has been publicly disclosed, (h) to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar
organization or any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender s investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect to such Lender, (i) in connection with the exercise of any
remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (j) to data service providers (including league table providers) that serve the lending industry to the extent such information is of the type customarily provided to such providers or
(k) if agreed by the Borrower in its sole discretion, to any other Person.    Each Lender acknowledges that information furnished to it
pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates and their related parties or their respective securities, and confirms that it has developed compliance
procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and that it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with those procedures and applicable law, including Federal and state securities laws.  
 All information, including requests for waivers and amendments, furnished by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to, or in the
course of administering, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents will be syndicate-level information, which may contain material non-public information about the Borrower and its Affiliates and their related parties or their respective
securities. Accordingly, each Lender represents to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it has identified in its administrative questionnaire a credit contact who may receive information that may contain material non-public information in
accordance with its compliance procedures and applicable law, including Federal and state securities laws.    The Borrower represents and
warrants that it and its Subsidiaries either (i) have no registered or publicly traded securities outstanding, or (ii) files its financial statements with the SEC and/or makes its financial statements available to potential holders of its
144A securities, and, accordingly, the Borrower hereby (i) authorizes the Administrative Agent to make the financial statements to be provided under Section 6.1(a) and (b), along with the Loan Documents, available to Public-Siders and
(ii) agrees that at the time such financial statements are provided hereunder, they shall already have been made available to holders of its securities. The Borrower will not request that any other material be posted to Public-Siders without
expressly representing and warranting to the Administrative Agent in writing that such materials do not constitute material non-public information within the meaning of the federal securities laws or that the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have no
 
      114  

outstanding publicly traded securities, including 144A securities. For the avoidance of doubt, the Projections and monthly financial statements provided pursuant to Section 6.1(c) shall not
be posted to Public-Siders.    The Borrower hereby acknowledges that (a) the Administrative Agent will make available to the Lenders
materials and/or information provided by or on behalf of the Loan Parties hereunder (collectively, the   Borrower Materials  ) by posting the Borrower Materials on IntraLinks/IntraAgency or another similar electronic system (the
  Platform  ) and (b) certain of the Lenders may be Public-Siders. If any Borrower Materials are designated by the Loan Parties as  PRIVATE , such Borrower Materials will not be made available to that portion of the
Platform designated  Public Investor,  which is intended to contain only information that is either publicly available or not material information (though it may be sensitive and proprietary) with respect to Borrower, its Subsidiaries or
their securities for purposes of federal and state securities laws. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked  PRIVATE  or  CONFIDENTIAL  as not containing any material
non-public information with respect to the Borrower, its Subsidiaries or their securities for purposes of federal and state securities laws.  
 10.16   WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL . THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.   
 10.17  USA Patriot Act . Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the   Patriot Act  ), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and
other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.    10.18  Intercreditor
Agreement . Each Lender hereby authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent (a) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on its behalf, perform the Intercreditor Agreement on its behalf and take any actions thereunder as determined by
the Administrative Agent to be necessary or advisable to protect the interest of the Lenders, and each Lender agrees to be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and (b) to enter into any other intercreditor agreement reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent on its behalf, perform such intercreditor agreement on its behalf and take any actions thereunder as determined by the Administrative Agent to be necessary or advisable to protect the interests of the
Lenders, and each Lender agrees to be bound by the terms of such intercreditor agreement. Each Lender acknowledges that the Intercreditor Agreement governs, among other things, Lien priorities and rights of the Lenders and the Term Loan Secured
Parties (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to the Collateral, including the Term Loan Priority Collateral.    10.19
 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges
that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:  
 (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising
hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and  
      115  

(b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if
applicable:    (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;  
 (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial
Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or    (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of
the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.
