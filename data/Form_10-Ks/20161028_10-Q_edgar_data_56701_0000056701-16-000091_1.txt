  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  September 30, 2016    
  (Unaudited) 

1.        CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
    
  The condensed consolidated balance sheet of Koss Corporation (the "Company") as of   June 30, 2016  , has been derived from audited financial statements.  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein are based on interim amounts.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented have been made.  The operating results for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be experienced for the full fiscal year ending   June 30, 2017  . 
    
  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Registrant s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016  . 

2.        UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION RELATED COSTS AND RECOVERIES    
    
  In December 2009, the Company learned of significant unauthorized transactions as previously reported. The Company has ongoing costs and recoveries associated with the unauthorized transactions. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , unauthorized transaction related costs, net, of   $37,500   and   $37,475  , respectively, were incurred for legal fees related to claims initiated against third parties (see Note 11). 

3.        INVENTORIES    
    
  The components of inventories were as follows: 

4.        INCOME TAXES    
    
  The Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in several state jurisdictions.  The Company s federal tax returns for tax years beginning July 1, 2012 or later are open.  For states in which the Company files state income tax returns, the statute of limitations is generally open for tax years ended June 30, 2012 and forward.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded an income tax expense of   $43,931  , compared to an income tax benefit of   $61,400   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The Company does not believe it has any unrecognized tax benefits as of   September 30, 2016   and as of   June 30, 2016  .  Any changes to the Company s unrecognized tax benefits as of   September 30, 2016  , if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.

5.        CREDIT FACILITY    
    
  On May 12, 2010, the Company entered into a secured credit facility ( Credit Agreement ) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( Lender ).  The Credit Agreement provided for an   $8,000,000   revolving secured credit facility with interest rates either ranging from   0.0%   to   0.75%   over the Lender s most recently publicly announced prime rate or   2.0%   to   3.0%   over LIBOR, depending on the Company s leverage ratio.  The Company pays a fee of   0.3%   to   0.45%   for unused amounts committed in the credit facility.  On July 23, 2014, the Credit Agreement was amended to reduce the facility to   $5,000,000  , subject to a borrowing base calculation as defined in the Credit Agreement, and to amend certain financial covenants.  On May 31, 2016, the Credit Agreement was amended to extend the expiration to July 31, 2018, and to amend certain financial covenants.  In addition to the revolving loans, the Credit Agreement also provides that the Company may, from time to time, request the Lender to issue letters of credit for the benefit of the Company of up to a sublimit of   $2,000,000   and subject to certain other limitations.  The loan may be used only for general corporate purposes of the Company. 
    
  The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type.  The negative covenants include restrictions on other indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, certain investments, asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates, among other restrictions.  The financial covenants include minimum debt service coverage ratio requirements.  The Company and the Lender also entered into the Pledge and Security Agreement dated May 12, 2010, under which the Company granted the Lender a security interest in substantially all of the Company s assets in connection with the Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement.  The Company is currently in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , there were no outstanding borrowings on the facility. 
    
  The Company incurs interest expense primarily related to its secured credit facility.  Interest expense was   $846   and   $5,318   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 

6.        ACCRUED LIABILITIES    
    
  Accrued liabilities were as follows: 

7.        INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON AND COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENT SHARE    
    
  Basic income (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.  The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding was   7,382,706   for the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  When dilutive, stock options are included in income (loss) per share as share equivalents using the treasury stock method.  For the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no common stock equivalents related to stock option grants that were included in the computation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for diluted income (loss) per share.  Shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options of   2,365,000   and   2,335,000   were excluded from the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding for the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as they would be anti-dilutive.

Index  

8.        STOCK OPTIONS    
    
  The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for options granted under both the 1990 Flexible Incentive Plan and the 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan.  The stock-based compensation relates to stock options granted to employees, non-employee directors and non-employee consultants.  In the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , options to purchase   485,000   shares were granted under the 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan at a weighted average exercise price of   $2.33  .  In the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , options to purchase   390,000   shares were granted under the 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan at a weighted average exercise price of   $2.76  .  Stock-based compensation expense during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $88,523   and   $116,004  , respectively.

11.        LEGAL MATTERS    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is party to the following matter related to the unauthorized transactions described below: 

On December 17, 2010, the Company filed an action against Park Bank in Circuit Court of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin alleging a claim of breach of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act relating to the unauthorized transactions, as previously reported.  In 2015, Park Bank filed third party claims based on contribution and subrogation against Grant Thornton LLP and Michael Koss.  The Court granted motions to dismiss the contribution claims against Grant Thornton LLP and Michael Koss, but determined that it was premature to decide the subrogation claims at this stage of the proceedings.  On or around March 11, 2016, the Court entered an order granting Park Bank's motion for summary judgment that dismissed the case.  On March 22, 2016, the Company filed a Notice of Appeal that appeals the order granting Park Bank's motion for summary judgment and the Court's denial of the motion to dismiss the subrogation claims. 
       
  The ultimate resolution of this matter is not determinable unless otherwise noted.

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
       
  Overview 
    
  The Company developed stereo headphones in 1958 and has been a leader in the industry.  Koss markets a complete line of high-fidelity headphones, wireless Bluetooth  headphones, wireless Bluetooth  speakers, computer headsets, telecommunications headsets, active noise canceling headphones, and compact disc recordings of American Symphony Orchestras on the Koss Classics  label. The Company operates as one business segment. 
    
  Results of Operations Summary 

Gross profit as a percent of sales increased to   30.6%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   29.8%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  These fluctuations were primarily due to the change in the mix of business by product, customer and sales channels. 
                
    Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were consistent with the same period in the prior year. 
       
  Financial Results 
    
  The following table presents selected financial data for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

2016   Results Compared with   2015 
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , sales increased   14.8%   to   $6,348,706  .  Net sales increased in the export markets but were consistent with the prior year in the domestic markets.   
    
  Net sales in the domestic market were approximately $3,818,000 in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , which is consistent with last year's approximately $3,900,000.  Declines at several specialty product accounts, which tend to be inconsistent by quarter, were offset by increased sales at retail related accounts and distribution.   
    
  Export net sales have increased to approximately $2,531,000 for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to approximately $1,631,000 for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , with the OEM customer in Asia being the primary driver.  In general, sales to distributors in Europe and Asia increased except for the Scandinavian distributor, which has excess supply of certain products.

     Index  

Gross profit increased to   30.6%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   29.8%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This increase is driven by sales mix as well as the increase in sales. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $10,000 higher than last year for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , due to higher 401(k) match expense, increased expense for testing related to new product introductions, and higher deferred compensation expense.  These increases were partially offset by lower expense for stock-based compensation and higher increases in cash surrender value of life insurance.  
    
  Interest expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was lower than last year due to positive cash flows from operations which resulted in limited borrowing on the Company's bank line of credit facility. 
    
  The effective income tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , was   34.3%  , which is comprised of the U.S. federal statutory rate of 34% and the effect of state income taxes.  It is anticipated that the effective income tax rate will be approximately 38-40% for the year ended   June 30, 2017  .    
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Operating Activities 
    
  In the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company reduced inventories by   $1,207,792   and reduced accounts receivable by   $270,170  , which, offset by a reduction in accounts payable of   $1,332,411  , led to cash generation of   $62,445   compared to a use of cash last year. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Cash used in investing activities was higher for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as the Company increased expenditures for tooling related to new product introductions.  The Company anticipates it will incur total expenditures of approximately $700,000 to $900,000 for tooling, leasehold improvements and capital expenditures during the fiscal year ending   June 30, 2017  .  The Company expects to generate sufficient cash flow through operations or through the use of its credit facility to fund these expenditures. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no outstanding borrowings on its bank line of credit facility.  The Company had outstanding borrowings of $400,000 on its bank line of credit as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  There were no purchases of common stock in   2016   or   2015   under the stock repurchase program.  No stock options were exercised in   2016   or   2015  . 

12 

     Index  

Liquidity 
    
  The Company's capital expenditures are primarily for tooling. In addition, it has interest payments on its borrowings when it uses its line of credit facility.  The Company believes that cash generated from operations, together with cash reserves and borrowings available under its credit facility, provide it with adequate liquidity to meet operating requirements, debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  The Company regularly evaluates new product offerings, inventory levels and capital expenditures to ensure that it is effectively allocating resources in line with current market conditions. 
    
  Credit Facility 
    
  On May 12, 2010, the Company entered into a secured credit facility ( Credit Agreement ) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( Lender ).  The Credit Agreement provided for an   $8,000,000   revolving secured credit facility and letters of credit for the benefit of the Company of up to a sublimit of   $2,000,000  .  On July 23, 2014, the Credit Agreement was amended to lower the revolving credit line to   $5,000,000   and to amend certain financial covenants.  On May 31, 2016, the Credit Agreement was amended to extend the expiration to July 31, 2018, and to amend certain financial covenants.  The Company and the Lender also entered into the Pledge and Security Agreement dated May 12, 2010, under which the Company granted the Lender a security interest in substantially all of the Company s assets in connection with the Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement.  The Company is currently in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , there were no outstanding borrowings on the facility. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements other than the lease for the facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The Company leases the facility from Koss Holdings, LLC, which is wholly-owned by the former Chairman.  On   May 15, 2012  , the lease was renewed for a period of   five   years, ending   June 30, 2018  , and is being accounted for as an operating lease.  The lease extension maintained the rent at a fixed rate of   $380,000   per year.  The Company is responsible for all property maintenance, insurance, taxes and other normal expenses related to ownership.  The facility is in good repair and, in the opinion of management, is suitable and adequate for the Company s business purposes.

    Controls and Procedures 
       
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) are designed to ensure that: (1) information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (2)  such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures.  Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
    
  The Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company s management has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016   were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
