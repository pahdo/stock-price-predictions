Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made, and accordingly speak only as of that time. Actual results or developments might differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements because of various factors including: 
             
    the Companies are extensively regulated and are subject to penalties; 
                
    the Utilities  rate plans may not provide a reasonable return; 
                
    the Companies may be adversely affected by changes to the Utilities  rate plans; 
                
    the intentional misconduct of employees or contractors could adversely affect the Companies; 
                
    the failure of, or damage to, the Companies  facilities could adversely affect the Companies; 
                
    a cyber attack could adversely affect the Companies; 
                
    the Companies are exposed to risks from the environmental consequences of their operations; 
                
    a disruption in the wholesale energy markets or failure by an energy supplier could adversely affect the Companies; 
                
    the Companies have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities; 
                
    Con Edison s ability to pay dividends or interest depends on dividends from its subsidiaries; 
                
    the Companies require access to capital markets to satisfy funding requirements; 
                
    the Companies  strategies may not be effective to address changes in the external business environment; and 
                
    the Companies also face other risks that are beyond their control.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

General 
  These combined notes accompany and form an integral part of the separate consolidated financial statements of each of the   two   separate registrants: Consolidated Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Con Edison) and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. and its subsidiaries (CECONY). CECONY is a subsidiary of Con Edison and as such its financial condition and results of operations and cash flows, which are presented separately in the CECONY consolidated financial statements, are also consolidated, along with those of Con Edison s other utility subsidiary, Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O R), Con Edison Transmission, Inc. (Con Edison Transmission) and Con Edison s competitive energy businesses in Con Edison s consolidated financial statements. The term  Utilities  is used in these notes to refer to CECONY and O R. 
  As used in these notes, the term  Companies  refers to Con Edison and CECONY and, except as otherwise noted, the information in these combined notes relates to each of the Companies. However, CECONY makes no representation as to information relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than itself. 
  The separate interim consolidated financial statements of each of the Companies are unaudited but, in the opinion of their respective managements, reflect all adjustments (which include only normally recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The Companies  separate interim consolidated financial statements should be read together with their separate audited financial statements (including the combined notes thereto) included in Item 8 of their combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015   and their separate unaudited financial statements (including the combined notes thereto) included in Part I, Item 1 of their combined Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.   Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
  Con Edison has   two   regulated utility subsidiaries: CECONY and O R. CECONY provides electric service and gas service in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. O R, along with its regulated utility subsidiary, provides electric service in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey and gas service in southeastern New York. Con Edison has the following competitive energy businesses: Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. (Con Edison Solutions), a company which provides energy-related products and services to retail customers; Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (Con Edison Energy), a company that provides energy-related products and services to wholesale customers; and Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. (Con Edison Development), a company that develops, owns and operates renewable and energy infrastructure projects. In addition, Con Edison has a subsidiary, Con Edison Transmission, that invests in electric transmission facilities through its subsidiary, Consolidated Edison Transmission, LLC (CET Electric), and invests in gas pipeline and storage facilities through its subsidiary Con Edison Gas Pipeline and Storage, LLC (CET Gas). See Note P.

(a) 
    The electric base rate increases shown above are in addition to a   $48 million   increase resulting from the December 2016 expiration of a temporary credit under the current rate plan. At the NYSPSC s option, these increases may be implemented with increases of   $199 million   in each rate year.  
              (b) 
    Deferrals for property taxes are limited to   90   percent of the difference from amounts reflected in rates, subject to an annual maximum for the remaining difference of not more than a maximum number of basis points impact on return on common equity:  Yr. 1 - 10.0 basis points; Yr. 2 - 7.5 basis points; and Yr. 3 - 5.0 basis points. 
              (c) 
    In general, if actual expenses for municipal infrastructure support (other than company labor) are below the amounts reflected in rates the company will defer the difference for credit to customers, and if the actual expenses are above the amount reflected in rates the company will defer for recovery from customers   80   percent of the difference subject to a maximum deferral of   30   percent of the amount reflected in rates. 
              (d) 
    In addition, amounts reflected in rates relating to the regulatory asset for future income tax and the excess deferred federal income tax liability are subject to reconciliation. The NYSPSC staff is to audit the regulatory asset and the tax liability. Differences resulting from the NYSPSC staff review will be deferred for NYSPSC determination of any amounts to be refunded or collected from customers. 
       
  I  n April 2016, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected CECONY s challenge to FERC s approval of substantially increased charges allocated to CECONY for transmission service provided pursuant to the open access tariff of PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM). CECONY will continue to challenge FERC s approval of the increased charges that will be incurred over the remaining contract term, and in May 2016 filed an appeal of FERC's decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals. In April 2016, CECONY notified PJM that it will not be exercising its option to continue the service beyond April 2017. 
    
  CECONY - Gas 
  In September 2016, CECONY, the staff of the NYSPSC and other parties entered into a Joint Proposal for a CECONY gas rate plan for the   three  -year period January 2017 through December 2019. The Joint Proposal is subject to NYSPSC approval. The following table contains a summary of the gas rate plan.

  Rockland Electric Company (RECO) 
  In April 2016, RECO filed a request with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities for an electric rate increase of   $10 million  , effective March 2017. The filing reflected a return on common equity of   10.20 percent   and a common equity ratio of   49.81 percent  . In October 2016, RECO filed an update to its April 2016 request. The company decreased its requested March 2017 rate increase by   $4 million   to   $6 million  . The updated filing reflects a return on common equity of   10.20 percent   and a common equity ratio of   50.15 percent  . The filing reflects continuation of provisions pursuant to which the company recovers its purchased power and fuel costs from customers.

Other Regulatory Matters 
  In April 2016, the NYSPSC approved the September 2015 Joint Proposal among CECONY, the NYSPSC staff and others with respect to the prudence proceeding the NYSPSC commenced in February 2009 and related matters. Pursuant to the Joint Proposal, the company is required to credit   $116 million   to customers and, for the period 2017 through 2044, to not seek to recover from customers an aggregate   $55 million   relating to return on its capital expenditures. In addition, the company s revenues that were made subject to potential refund in this proceeding are no longer subject to refund. At   September 30, 2016  , the company had a   $96 million   regulatory liability for the remaining amount to be credited to customers related to this matter. 
  In June 2014, the NYSPSC initiated a proceeding to investigate the practices of qualifying persons to perform plastic fusions on gas facilities. New York State regulations require gas utilities to qualify and, except in certain circumstances, annually requalify workers that perform fusion to join plastic pipe. The NYSPSC directed the New York gas utilities to provide information in this proceeding about their compliance with the qualification and requalification requirements and related matters; their procedures for compliance with all gas safety regulations; and their annual chief executive officer certifications regarding these and other procedures. CECONY s qualification and requalification procedures had not included certain required testing to evaluate specimen fuses. In addition, CECONY and O R had not timely requalified certain workers that had been qualified under their respective procedures to perform fusion to join plastic pipe. CECONY and O R have requalified their workers who perform plastic pipe fusions. In May 2015, the NYSPSC, which indicated that it would address enforcement at a later date, ordered CECONY, O R and other gas utilities to perform risk assessment and remediation plans, additional leakage surveying and reporting; CECONY to hire an independent statistician to develop a risk assessment and remediation plan; and the gas utilities to implement certain new plastic fusion requirements.   In December 2015, the NYSPSC staff informed O R that the company had satisfactorily completed its risk assessment and remediation plan. CECONY submitted its risk assessment and remediation plan to the NYSPSC staff in October 2016.  
  In November 2015, the NYSPSC ordered CECONY to show cause why the NYSPSC should not commence proceedings to penalize the company for alleged violations of gas safety regulations identified by the NYSPSC staff in its investigation of a March 2014 explosion and fire and to review the prudence of the company's conduct associated with the incident. See "Manhattan Explosion and Fire" in Note H. In December 2015, the company responded that the NYSPSC should not institute the proceedings and disputed the alleged violations.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , CECONY had a   $28 million   regulatory liability related to the June 2014 plastic fusion proceeding and the November 2015 order to show cause.  The company is unable to estimate the amount or range of its possible loss related to these matters in excess of this regulatory liability. 
  CECONY has incurred costs for gas emergency response activities in 2014, 2015 and 2016 in excess of amounts reflected in the company s gas rate plan. The company has requested NYSPSC authorization to defer as a regulatory asset   $29 million   and   $35 million   of such incremental costs incurred in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The company estimates that it will incur   $37 million   of such incremental costs in 2016. At September 30, 2016, the company had not deferred any such incremental costs.

Table of Contents  

Note C   Capitalization 
  In February 2016, a Con Edison Development subsidiary issued   $218 million   aggregate principal amount of   4.21   percent senior notes, due   2041  , secured by the company's Texas Solar 7 solar project. 
    
  In May 2016, Con Edison issued approximately   10 million   common shares resulting in net proceeds, after issuance expenses, of   $702 million  , and   $500 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.00   percent debentures, due   2021  . Also, in May 2016, a Con Edison Development subsidiary issued   $95 million   aggregate principal amount of   4.07   percent senior notes, due   2036  , secured by the company's California Holding 3 solar projects. In June 2016, Con Edison borrowed   $400 million   pursuant to a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. The borrowing matures in 2018 and bears interest at a LIBOR plus margin of   1.00   percent. Also in June 2016, CECONY issued   $550 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.85   percent debentures, due   2046  .  Also, in June 2016, a Con Edison Solutions subsidiary borrowed   $2 million   pursuant to a loan agreement with a New Jersey utility. The borrowing matures in   2026  , bears interest of   11.18   percent and may be repaid in cash or project Solar Renewable Energy Certificates. 
    
  In September 2016, CECONY redeemed at maturity   $400 million   aggregate principal amount of   5.50   percent debentures. In September 2016, O R agreed to issue and sell for delivery in December 2016   $75 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.88   percent debentures, due 2046. In October 2016, O R redeemed at maturity   $75 million   aggregate principal amount of   5.45   percent debentures. 
    
  The carrying amounts and fair values of long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were: 

Fair values of long-term debt have been estimated primarily using available market information. For Con Edison,   $15,689 million   and   $636 million   of the fair value of long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   are classified as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively. For CECONY,   $12,928 million   and   $636 million   of the fair value of long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   are classified as Level 2 and Level 3, respectively (see Note L). The   $636 million   of long-term debt classified as Level 3 is CECONY s tax-exempt, auction-rate securities for which the market is highly illiquid and there is a lack of observable inputs. 

Note D   Short-Term Borrowing 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Con Edison had   $601 million   of commercial paper outstanding of which   $480 million   was outstanding under CECONY s program. The weighted average interest rate at   September 30, 2016   was   0.7 percent   for both Con Edison and CECONY. At   December 31, 2015  , Con Edison had   $1,529 million   of commercial paper outstanding of which   $1,033 million   was outstanding under CECONY s program. The weighted average interest rate at   December 31, 2015   was   0.7 percent   for both Con Edison and CECONY. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , no loans were outstanding under the credit agreement (Credit Agreement) and   $2 million   (including   $2 million   for CECONY) and   $15 million   of letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement, respectively. 

Note E   Pension Benefits 
  Total Periodic Benefit Cost 
  The components of the Companies  total periodic benefit costs for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:

     Table of Contents  

Expected Contributions 
  Based on estimates as of   September 30, 2016  , the Companies expect to make contributions to the pension plans during   2016   of   $508 million   (of which   $469 million   is to be contributed by CECONY). The Companies  policy is to fund the total periodic benefit cost of the qualified plan to the extent tax deductible and to also contribute to the non-qualified supplemental plans. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Companies contributed   $504 million   (of which   $466 million   was contributed by CECONY) to the pension plans. CECONY also contributed   $17 million   to its external trust for supplemental plans.  

Note F   Other Postretirement Benefits 
  Total Periodic Benefit Cost 
  The components of the Companies  total periodic other postretirement benefit costs for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:

     Table of Contents  

Contributions 
  During the first nine months of 2016, the Companies contributed   $6 million  , nearly all of which was contributed by CECONY, to the other postretirement benefit plans. The Companies' policy is to fund the total periodic benefit cost of the plans to the extent tax deductible. 

Note G   Environmental Matters 
  Superfund Sites 
  Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of the Utilities and their predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored. 
  The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation and remediation costs (which include costs of demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment and monitoring) and natural resource damages. Liability under these laws can be material and may be imposed for contamination from past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred. The sites at which the Utilities have been asserted to have liability under these laws, including their manufactured gas plant sites and any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated, are referred to herein as  Superfund Sites.  
  For Superfund Sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the Utilities are not managing the site investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the amount the Utilities will need to pay to investigate and, where determinable, discharge their related obligations. For Superfund Sites (including the manufactured gas plant sites) for which one of the Utilities is managing the investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the company s share of the undiscounted cost to investigate the sites and, for sites that have been investigated in whole or in part, the cost to remediate the sites, if remediation is necessary and if a reasonable estimate of such cost can be made. Remediation costs are estimated in light of the information available, applicable remediation standards and experience with similar sites. 
  The accrued liabilities and regulatory assets related to Superfund Sites at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

Most of the accrued Superfund Site liability relates to sites that have been investigated, in whole or in part. However, for some of the sites, the extent and associated cost of the required remediation has not yet been determined. As investigations progress and information pertaining to the required remediation becomes available,  

26    

     Table of Contents  

the Utilities expect that additional liability may be accrued, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be material. The Companies are unable to estimate the time period over which the remaining accrued liability will be incurred because, among other things, the required remediation has not been determined for some of the sites. Under their current rate plans, the Utilities are permitted to recover or defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) certain site investigation and remediation costs. 
  Environmental remediation costs incurred related to Superfund Sites for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:    

Con Edison and CECONY received   $1 million   in insurance recoveries for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .   No   insurance recoveries were received by Con Edison or CECONY for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  In 2015, Con Edison and CECONY estimated that for their manufactured gas plant sites (including CECONY s Astoria site), the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the investigation and remediation of coal tar and/or other environmental contaminants could range up to   $2.8 billion   and   $2.7 billion  , respectively. These estimates were based on the assumption that there is contamination at all sites, including those that have not yet been fully investigated and additional assumptions about the extent of the contamination and the type and extent of the remediation that may be required. Actual experience may be materially different. 
  Asbestos Proceedings 
  Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against the Utilities and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the Utilities. The suits that have been resolved, which are many, have been resolved without any payment by the Utilities, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to them. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions of dollars; however, the Utilities believe that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, based on the disposition of previous claims. At   September 30, 2016  , Con Edison and CECONY had accrued their estimated aggregate undiscounted potential liabilities for these suits and additional suits that may be brought over the next   15   years as shown in the following table. The estimates were based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis and risk factor assessment. Trial courts have begun, and unless otherwise determined by an appellate court may continue, to apply a different standard for determining liability in asbestos suits than the standard that applied historically. As a result, the Companies currently believe that there is a reasonable possibility of an exposure to loss in excess of the liability accrued for the suits. The Companies are unable to estimate the amount or range of such loss. In addition, certain current and former employees have claimed or are claiming workers  compensation benefits based on alleged disability from exposure to asbestos. Under its current rate plans, CECONY is permitted to defer as regulatory assets (for subsequent recovery through rates) costs incurred for its asbestos lawsuits and workers  compensation claims. 
  The accrued liability for asbestos suits and workers  compensation proceedings (including those related to asbestos exposure) and the amounts deferred as regulatory assets for the Companies at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

Note H   Other Material Contingencies 
  Manhattan Steam Main Rupture 
  In July 2007, a CECONY steam main located in midtown Manhattan ruptured. It has been reported that   one   person died and others were injured as a result of the incident. Several buildings in the area were damaged. Debris from the incident included dirt and mud containing asbestos. The response to the incident required the closing of several buildings and streets for various periods. Approximately   sixty   suits are pending against the company seeking generally unspecified compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages, for wrongful death, personal injury, property damage and business interruption. The company has notified its insurers of the incident and believes that the policies in force at the time of the incident will cover the company s costs to satisfy its liability to others in connection with the suits. In the company s estimation, there is not a reasonable possibility that an exposure to loss exists for the suits that is materially in excess of the estimated liability accrued. At   September 30, 2016  , the company has accrued its estimated liability for the suits of   $30 million   and an insurance receivable of   $39 million  . 
  Manhattan Explosion and Fire 
  On March 12, 2014,   two   multi-use five-story tall buildings located on Park Avenue between 116   th    and 117   th    Street in Manhattan were destroyed by an explosion and fire. CECONY had delivered gas to the buildings through service lines from a distribution main located below ground on Park Avenue.   Eight   people died and more than   50   people were injured. Additional buildings were also damaged. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated. The parties to the investigation included the company, the City of New York, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the NYSPSC (which also conducted an investigation). In June 2015, the NTSB issued a final report concerning the incident, its probable cause and safety recommendations. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the incident was (1) the failure of a defective fusion joint at a service tee (which joined a plastic service line to a plastic distribution main) installed by the company that allowed gas to leak from the distribution main and migrate into a building where it ignited and (2) a breach in a City sewer line that allowed groundwater and soil to flow into the sewer, resulting in a loss of support for the distribution main, which caused it to sag and overstressed the defective fusion joint. The NTSB also made safety recommendations, including recommendations to the company that addressed its procedures for the preparation and examination of plastic fusions, training of its staff on conditions for notifications to the City s Fire Department and extension of its gas main isolation valve installation program. Approximately   seventy   suits are pending against the company seeking generally unspecified damages and, in some cases, punitive damages, for wrongful death, personal injury, property damage and business interruption. The company has notified its insurers of the incident and believes that the policies in force at the time of the incident will cover the company s costs, in excess of a required retention (the amount of which is not material), to satisfy any liability it may have for damages in connection with the incident. The company is unable to estimate the amount or range of its possible loss for damages related to the incident. At   September 30, 2016  , the company had not accrued a liability for damages related to the incident. 
  Other Contingencies 
  See  Other Regulatory Matters  in Note B and  Uncertain Tax Positions  in Note I. 
  Guarantees 
  Con Edison and its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance primarily to third parties on behalf of their subsidiaries. Maximum amounts guaranteed by Con Edison totaled   $2,422 million   and   $2,856 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 

28    

     Table of Contents  

A summary, by type and term, of Con Edison s total guarantees at   September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

Con Edison Transmission     Con Edison has guaranteed payment by CET Electric of the contributions CET Electric agreed to make to New York Transco LLC (NY Transco). CET Electric acquired a   45.7 percent   interest in NY Transco when it was formed in 2014. NY Transco s transmission projects are expected to be initially developed by CECONY and other New York transmission owners and then transferred to NY Transco. In May 2016, the transmission owners transferred certain projects to NY Transco, as to which CET Electric made its required contributions. The other projects that were proposed when NY Transco was formed remain subject to certain authorizations from the NYSPSC, the FERC and, as applicable, other federal, state and local agencies. Guarantee amount shown is for the maximum possible required amount of CET Electric s contributions for these other projects as calculated based on the assumptions that the projects are completed at   175 percent   of their estimated costs and NY Transco does not use any debt financing for the projects. Guarantee term shown is assumed as the timing of the contributions is not certain. Also included within the table above is a guarantee for   $25 million   from Con Edison on behalf of CET Gas in relation to a proposed gas transmission project in West Virginia and Virginia. See Note P. 
  Energy Transactions     Con Edison guarantees payments on behalf of its competitive energy businesses in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions in electricity, gas, pipeline capacity, transportation, oil, renewable energy credits and energy services. To the extent that liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in Con Edison s consolidated balance sheet. Guarantee amounts shown above include   $123 million   of guarantees or other credit support provided by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Solutions that may continue in effect during the period in which Con Edison Solutions provides transition services in connection with the retail electric supply business it sold in September 2016. See Note P. As part of the sale agreement, the purchaser has agreed to pay Con Edison Solutions for draws on such guarantees or other credit support. 
  Renewable Electric Production Projects     Con Edison, Con Edison Development, and Con Edison Solutions guarantee payments associated with the investment in solar and wind energy facilities on behalf of their wholly-owned subsidiaries.  
  Other     Other guarantees include   $70 million   in guarantees provided by Con Edison to Travelers Insurance Company for indemnity agreements for surety bonds in connection with energy service projects and operation of solar energy facilities of Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development, respectively. Other guarantees also includes Con Edison's guarantee (subject to a   $53 million   maximum amount) of certain obligations of Con Edison Solutions under its agreement to sell its retail electric supply business. See Note P. In addition, Con Edison issued a guarantee estimated at   $5 million   to the Public Utility Commission of Texas covering obligations of Con Edison Solutions as a retail electric provider. As part of the sale agreement for the retail electric supply business discussed above, the purchaser has agreed to pay Con Edison Solutions for draws on the guarantee to the Public Utility Commission of Texas. 
   
  Note I   Income Tax 
  Con Edison s income tax expense   increased   to   $314 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $249 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Con Edison's effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   39 percent   and   37   percent, respectively. The increase in Con Edison's effective tax rate is primarily due to higher state income taxes and a decrease in tax benefits for plant-related flow through items, offset in part by higher tax benefits for injuries and damages payments, research and development tax credits and renewable energy tax credits. 
    
  CECONY s income tax expense   increased   to   $226 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $222 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . CECONY's effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   37 percent  . The decrease in tax benefits for plant-related flow through items, were more than offset by lower state income taxes and increased tax benefits as a result of higher injuries and damages payments and research and development tax credits.

Con Edison s income tax expense increased to   $602 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $548 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Con Edison's effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   37 percent   and   35 percent  , respectively. The increase in Con Edison's effective tax rate is primarily due to higher state income taxes and a decrease in tax benefits for plant-related flow through items, offset in part by higher tax benefits for injuries and damages payments, research and development tax credits and renewable energy tax credits.  
    
  CECONY s income tax expense decreased to   $491 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $515 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . CECONY's effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   36 percent   and   35 percent  , respectively. The increase in CECONY's effective tax rate is primarily related to a decrease in tax benefits for plant-related flow through items, offset in part by lower state income taxes and increased research and development tax credits. 
    
  In September 2016, Con Edison filed its 2015 federal income tax return, requesting a refund of   $19 million   of estimated tax payments and, in October 2016, the company received the refund. The company carried back a 2015 net operating loss to 2007, requesting a refund of   $16 million   of federal income tax and, in October 2016, the company received the refund. Con Edison anticipates a federal net operating loss for 2016, primarily due to bonus depreciation. Con Edison expects to carryback a portion of its 2016 net operating loss and recover   $32 million   of income tax. General business tax credits that became available as a result of the net operating loss carryback, as well as the remaining 2016 net operating loss will be carried forward to future tax years. A deferred tax asset for these tax attribute carryforwards was recorded, and no valuation allowance has been provided, as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized.   
    
  Uncertain Tax Positions 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated liability for uncertain tax positions for Con Edison was   $37 million   (  $5 million   for CECONY). Con Edison reasonably expects to resolve approximately   $29 million   (  $20 million  , net of federal taxes) of its uncertain tax positions within the next twelve months, of which the entire amount, if recognized, would reduce Con Edison s effective tax rate. The amount related to CECONY is approximately   $5 million   (  $4 million  , net of federal taxes), of which the entire amount, if recognized, would reduce CECONY s effective tax rate. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, that would reduce Con Edison s effective tax rate is   $37 million   (  $25 million  , net of federal taxes). 
  The Companies recognize interest on liabilities for uncertain tax positions in interest expense and would recognize penalties, if any, in operating expenses in the Companies  consolidated income statements. In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Companies recognized an immaterial amount of interest expense and no penalties for uncertain tax positions in their consolidated income statements. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Companies recognized an immaterial amount of accrued interest on their consolidated balance sheets.

Note J   Financial Information by Business Segment 
  Con Edison s principal business segments prior to June 2016 were CECONY s regulated utility activities, O R s regulated utility activities and Con Edison s competitive energy businesses. CECONY s principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. In 2016, Con Edison Transmission began investing, through CET Electric and CET Gas, in electric transmission and gas pipeline and storage assets (see Note P). As a result of these investments, in June 2016 Con Edison changed its business segments to add Con Edison Transmission as a separate reportable segment based on management s reporting and decision-making, including performance evaluation and resource allocation. For comparison purposes, the previously reported financial information by business segments was reclassified to reflect the current business segment presentation. 
    
  The financial data for the business segments are as follows: 

(a) 
    Parent company and consolidation adjustments. Other does not represent a business segment.

Note K   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  Con Edison s subsidiaries hedge market price fluctuations associated with physical purchases and sales of electricity, natural gas, steam and, to a lesser extent, refined fuels by using derivative instruments including futures, forwards, basis swaps, options, transmission congestion contracts and financial transmission rights contracts. Derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value (see Note L), unless an exception is available under the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging. Qualifying derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts are not reported at fair value under the accounting rules. 
    
  The fair values of the Companies  commodity derivatives including the offsetting of assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were: 

(a) 
    Derivative instruments and collateral were offset on the consolidated balance sheet as applicable under the accounting rules. The Companies enter into master agreements for their commodity derivatives. These agreements typically provide offset in the event of contract termination. In such case, generally the non-defaulting party s payable will be offset by the defaulting party s payable. The non-defaulting party will customarily notify the defaulting party within a specific time period and come to an agreement on the early termination amount. 
              (b) 
    At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , margin deposits for Con Edison (  $12 million   and   $26 million  , respectively) and CECONY (  $12 million   and   $26 million  , respectively) were classified as derivative assets on the consolidated balance sheet, but not included in the table. Margin is collateral, typically cash, that the holder of a derivative instrument is required to deposit in order to transact on an exchange and to cover its potential losses with its broker or the exchange. 
              (c) 
    Amounts represent derivative assets and liabilities included in assets and liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet. 
       
  The Utilities generally recover their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state utility regulators. In accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations, the Utilities record a regulatory asset or liability to defer recognition of unrealized gains and losses on their electric and gas derivatives. As gains and losses are realized in future periods, they will be recognized as purchased power, gas and fuel costs in the Companies  consolidated income statements. Con Edison s competitive energy businesses record realized and unrealized gains and losses on their derivative contracts in purchased power, gas purchased for resale and non-utility revenue in the

reporting period in which they occur. Management believes that these derivative instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. 
    
  The following table presents the realized and unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives that have been deferred or recognized in earnings for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(a) 
    For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Con Edison recorded unrealized losses in non-utility operating revenue (  $2 million  ) and purchase power expense (  $23 million  ). 
              (b) 
    For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , Con Edison recorded in purchased power expense an unrealized pre-tax gain of   $12 million  . 

(a) 
    For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Con Edison recorded unrealized gains and losses in non-utility operating revenue (  $3 million   loss) and purchase power expense (  $11 million   gain). 
              (b) 
    For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , Con Edison recorded unrealized pre-tax gains and losses in non-utility operating revenue (  $3 million   loss) and purchased power expense (  $6 million   gain).

The following table presents the hedged volume of Con Edison s and CECONY s derivative transactions at   September 30, 2016  : 

(a) 
    Volumes are reported net of long and short positions, except natural gas collars where the volumes of long positions are reported. 
              (b) 
    Excludes electric congestion and gas basis swap contracts, which are associated with electric and gas contracts and hedged volumes. 
       
  The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterparty s nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements, collateral or prepayment arrangements, credit insurance and credit default swaps. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the Companies have a legally enforceable right to offset. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Con Edison and CECONY had   $141 million   and   $13 million   of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral, respectively. Con Edison s net credit exposure consisted of   $77 million   with independent system operators,   $34 million   with investment-grade counterparties,   $20 million   with commodity exchange brokers, and   $10 million   with non-investment grade/non-rated counterparties. CECONY s net credit exposure consisted of   $12 million   with commodity exchange brokers and   $1 million   with investment-grade counterparties. 
  The collateral requirements associated with, and settlement of, derivative transactions are included in net cash flows from operating activities in the Companies  consolidated statement of cash flows. Most derivative instrument contracts contain provisions that may require a party to provide collateral on its derivative instruments that are in a net liability position. The amount of collateral to be provided will depend on the fair value of the derivative instruments and the party s credit ratings. 
    
  The following table presents the aggregate fair value of the Companies  derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position, the collateral posted for such positions and the additional collateral that would have been required to be posted had the lowest applicable credit rating been reduced one level and to below investment grade at   September 30, 2016  :

    Non-derivative transactions for the purchase and sale of electricity and gas and qualifying derivative instruments, which have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales, are excluded from the table. These transactions primarily include purchases of electricity from independent system operators. In the event the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses were no longer extended unsecured credit for such purchases, the Companies would be required to post additional collateral of   $10 million   at   September 30, 2016  . For certain other such non-derivative transactions, the Companies could be required to post collateral under certain circumstances, including in the event counterparties had reasonable grounds for insecurity. 
              (b) 
    The Companies measure the collateral requirements by taking into consideration the fair value amounts of derivative instruments that contain credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liabilities position plus amounts owed to counterparties for settled transactions and amounts required by counterparties for minimum financial security. The fair value amounts represent unrealized losses, net of any unrealized gains where the Companies have a legally enforceable right to offset. 
              (c) 
    Derivative instruments that are net assets have been excluded from the table. At   September 30, 2016  , if Con Edison had been downgraded to below investment grade, it would have been required to post additional collateral for such derivative instruments of   $9 million  . 

Note L   Fair Value Measurements 
  The accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or  

35    

     Table of Contents  

liabilities. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable firm inputs. The Companies often make certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques. The Companies use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 
  The accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures established a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels. The rules require that assets and liabilities be classified in their entirety based on the level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assessing the significance of a particular input may require judgment considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The Companies classify fair value balances based on the fair value hierarchy defined by the accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures as follows: 
             
    Level 1   Consists of assets or liabilities whose value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date. An active market is one in which transactions for assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. This category includes contracts traded on active exchange markets valued using unadjusted prices quoted directly from the exchange. 
                
    Level 2   Consists of assets or liabilities valued using industry standard models and based on prices, other than quoted prices within Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. The industry standard models consider observable assumptions including time value, volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the underlying commodities, in addition to other economic measures. This category includes contracts traded on active exchanges or in over-the-counter markets priced with industry standard models. 
                
    Level 3   Consists of assets or liabilities whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies using inputs that are generally less readily observable and supported by little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best available information and subject to cost benefit constraints. This category includes contracts priced using models that are internally developed and contracts placed in illiquid markets. It also includes contracts that expire after the period of time for which quoted prices are available and internal models are used to determine a significant portion of the value. 
       
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized below. 

36    

     Table of Contents  

(a) 
    The Companies  policy is to review the fair value hierarchy and recognize transfers into and transfers out of the levels at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
              (b) 
    Level 2 assets and liabilities include investments held in the deferred compensation plan and/or non-qualified retirement plans, exchange-traded contracts where there is insufficient market liquidity to warrant inclusion in Level 1, certain over-the-counter derivative instruments for electricity, refined products and natural gas. Derivative instruments classified as Level 2 are valued using industry standard models that incorporate corroborated observable inputs; such as pricing services or prices from similar instruments that trade in liquid markets, time value and volatility factors. 
              (c) 
    The accounting rules for fair value measurements and disclosures require consideration of the impact of nonperformance risk (including credit risk) from a market participant perspective in the measurement of the fair value of assets and liabilities. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Companies determined that nonperformance risk would have no material impact on their financial position or results of operations. 
              (d) 
    Other assets are comprised of assets such as life insurance contracts within the deferred compensation plan and non-qualified retirement plans. 
              (e) 
    Amounts represent the impact of legally-enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Companies to net gain and loss positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties. 
              (f) 
    Amounts represent derivative assets and liabilities included in Assets and Liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet. 
       
  The employees in the Companies  risk management group develop and maintain the Companies  valuation policies and procedures for, and verify pricing and fair value valuation of, commodity derivatives. Under the Companies  policies and procedures, multiple independent sources of information are obtained for forward price curves used to value commodity derivatives. Fair value and changes in fair value of commodity derivatives are reported on a monthly basis to the Companies  risk committees, comprised of officers and employees of the Companies that oversee energy hedging at the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. The risk management group reports to the Companies  Vice President and Treasurer.

(a) 
    Amounts represent derivative instruments novated as part of the assets of Con Edison Solutions  retail electric supply business which were sold to a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation (see Note P). 
       
  For the Utilities, realized gains and losses on Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities are reported as part of purchased power, gas and fuel costs. The Utilities generally recover these costs in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utilities regulators. Unrealized gains and losses for commodity derivatives are generally deferred on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. 
  For the competitive energy businesses, realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities are reported in non-utility revenues (immaterial for both periods) and purchased power costs (  $5 million     loss   and   $3 million     loss  ) on the consolidated income statement for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities are reported in non-utility revenues (  immaterial   for both periods) and purchased power costs (  $6 million     loss   and   $12 million     loss  ) on the consolidated income statement for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively. The change in fair value relating to Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities held at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is included in non-utility revenues (  immaterial   for both periods) and purchased power costs (  $4 million     loss   and   $3 million     loss  ) on the consolidated income statement for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , the change in fair value relating to Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities is included in non-utility revenues (  immaterial   for both periods) and purchased power costs (  $2 million     loss   and   $8 million     loss  ) on the consolidated income statement, respectively. 

Note M   Variable Interest Entities 
  Con Edison enters into arrangements including leases, partnerships and electricity purchase agreements, with various entities. As a result of these arrangements, Con Edison retains or may retain a variable interest in these entities. 
  CECONY had a variable interest in a non-consolidated variable interest entity (VIE), Astoria Energy, LLC (Astoria Energy), with which CECONY entered into a long-term electricity purchase agreement that expired in April 2016. CECONY has ongoing long-term electricity purchase agreements with the following   two   potential VIEs: Cogen Technologies Linden Venture, LP, and Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, LP. In   2015  , requests were made of these   two   counterparties for information necessary to determine whether the entity was a VIE and whether CECONY is the primary beneficiary; however, the information was not made available. The payments for these contracts constitute CECONY s maximum exposure to loss with respect to the potential VIEs.  

38    

     Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the VIEs in which Con Edison Development has entered into as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(a)  With the exception of Texas Solar 4, Con Edison s ownership interest is   50 percent   and these projects are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Con Edison is not the primary beneficiary since the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the entities are shared equally between Con Edison Development and third parties. Con Edison s ownership interest in Texas Solar 4 is   80 percent   and is consolidated in the financial statements. Con Edison is the primary beneficiary since the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economics of Texas Solar 4 is held by Con Edison Development. The maximum exposure for Texas Solar 4 is the net assets of the investment offset by an   $8 million   noncontrolling interest. 
  (b)  Represents Con Edison Development s ownership interest in the project. 
  (c)  For investments accounted for under the equity method, maximum exposure is equal to the carrying value of the investment on the consolidated balance sheet and any related receivables due from the project. For consolidated investments, maximum exposure is equal to the net assets of the project on the consolidated balance sheet less any applicable noncontrolling interest. Con Edison did not provide any financial or other support during the year that was not previously contractually required. 
  (d)  In October 2016, Con Edison Development acquired the remaining   50   percent ownership interest in the project. See Note P. 

Note N   Related Party Transactions 
  The Utilities perform work and incur expenses on behalf of NY Transco, a company in which CET Electric has a   45.7 percent   equity interest (see Note P). The Utilities bill NY Transco for such work and expenses in accordance with established policies. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the amounts billed by CECONY to NY Transco were immaterial. 
  CECONY has storage and wheeling service contracts with Stagecoach Gas Services LLC (Stagecoach), a joint venture formed by a subsidiary of CET Gas and a subsidiary of Crestwood Equity Partners LP (Crestwood) (see Note P). In addition, CECONY is the replacement shipper on one of Crestwood s firm transportation agreements with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company LLC. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the amount of storage and wheeling services received by CECONY from Stagecoach was   $8 million  . Since the formation of the joint venture in June 2016, the amount of storage and wheeling services received by CECONY from Stagecoach was   $10 million  .  
  CECONY has a financial electric capacity contract with Con Edison Energy for the period May 2016 through April 2017. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Con Edison Energy's realized losses under this contract were   $1 million  . 
  At September 30, 2016 Con Edison Development has an outstanding note receivable of   $234 million   from Panoche Valley, a solar electric production project in which Con Edison Development has an ownership interest of   50   percent (see Note M). In October 2016, Con Edison Development acquired the remaining   50   percent interest in the project (see Note P). 

Note O   New Financial Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued a revenue recognition standard that will supersede the revenue recognition requirements within Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition,  and most industry-specific guidance under the Codification through Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  The purpose of the new guidance is to create a consistent framework for revenue recognition. The guidance clarifies how to measure and recognize revenue arising from customer contracts to depict the transfer of goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive. Additionally, in March and April 2016, respectively, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net)  to clarify how to apply the implementation guidance for principal versus agent considerations and ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing

The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The application of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies  financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

  instruments through ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  The amendment replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology which involved delayed recognition of credit losses. As the updated guidance now requires credit losses to be recognized when expected rather than when incurred, a broader range of reasonable and supportable information must be considered in developing the credit loss estimates. This includes financial instruments that are valued at amortized cost and available for sale.

     Table of Contents  

The Companies  results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with the   2015   periods, reflect changes in rate plans and regulatory charges and, in the   nine   month period, the impact of warmer than normal weather on steam revenues. Other lower operations and maintenance expenses reflect lower surcharges for assessments and fees that are collected in revenues from customers at the Utilities. In the   nine   month period, these expenses also reflect higher expenses for emergency response, municipal infrastructure support and stock-based compensation at CECONY. In addition, the Utilities' rate plans provide for revenues to cover expected changes in certain operating costs including depreciation, property taxes and other tax matters. The results of operations also include higher electric retail gross profit and income from renewable investments, the gain on sale of retail electric supply business, the gain and impairment related to a solar electric production investment, and the impact of the net mark-to-market effects of the competitive energy businesses. 
    
  The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   period as compared with   2015   periods, resulting from these and other major factors: 

(a) 
    Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the Utilities  New York electric and gas rate plans and the weather-normalization clause applicable to their gas businesses, revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers. Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the Companies  results of operations. 
              (b) 
    Includes the impact of the dilutive effect of Con Edison's stock issuances. 
              (c) 
    These variations include the impairment of certain assets held for sale in 2015, the gain and impairment related to a solar electric production investment and net mark-to-market effects shown in notes (a) and (b) in the Results of Operations table above.

Competitive Energy Businesses 
  The competitive energy businesses  results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   2015   period is as follows: 

Operating revenues     decreased     $89 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   2015   period, due primarily to lower electric retail revenues due in part to the sale of the retail electric supply business (see   Note P   to the   Third   Quarter Financial Statements). Electric retail revenues decreased $135 million due to lower unit prices ($98 million) and lower sales volume ($37 million). Wholesale revenues decreased $25 million due to lower sales volumes. Renewable revenues increased $40 million primarily due to an increase in renewable electric production projects in operation. Energy services revenues increased $31 million.   
    
  Purchased power   expenses   decreased     $136 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   2015   period due primarily to lower unit prices ($85 million), lower volumes ($46 million) and changes in mark-to-market gains ($5 million). 
    
  Gas purchased for resale     decreased     $22 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   2015   period due to lower sales volumes. 
    
  Other operations and maintenance   expenses   increased     $26 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   2015   period due primarily to an increase in energy services costs.   
    
  Depreciation and amortization     increased     $14 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   2015   period due an increase in solar electric production projects in operation during 2016. 
    
  Gain on sale of retail electric supply business   was   $104 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflecting the sale of the competitive energy businesses' retail electric supply business (see   Note P   to the   Third   Quarter Financial Statements). 
    
  Other Income (Deductions) 
  Other income (deductions)   increased     $3 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   2015   period due primarily to the earnings from equity investments. 
    
  Net Interest Expense 
  Net interest expense   increased     $18 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   2015   period due primarily to increased debt on solar electric production projects. 
    
  Income Tax Expense 
  Income taxes   increased     $51 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   2015   period due primarily to higher income before income tax expense ($46 million) and an adjustment to deferred state income taxes as a result of the sale of the retail electric supply business that increased the competitive energy businesses' state apportionment factors on its cumulative temporary differences ($13 million), offset in part by higher renewable energy tax credits ($7 million).

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The Companies  liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below. 
    
  Changes in the Companies  cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are summarized as follows: 

Cash Flows From Operating Activities 
  The Utilities  cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is affected primarily by factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the Utilities  New York electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows but generally not net income. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. In general, changes in the Utilities  cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. 
    
  Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies  cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense and amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities  New York electric and gas rate plans. 
    
  Net cash flows from operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   for Con Edison and CECONY were $  137 million   and $  215 million   higher, respectively, than in the   2015   period. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY reflects primarily the income taxes paid, net of refunds received in the 2016 period as compared with the 2015 period (  $137 million   and   $273 million  , respectively). The amount and timing of income tax payments and refunds reflect, among other things, the extension of bonus depreciation tax provisions.  
    
  The change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing is reflected within changes to accounts receivable   customers, recoverable energy costs and accounts payable balances. 
    
  Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
  Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $  1,030 million   and $  43 million   higher, respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   2015   period. The change for Con Edison reflects primarily increased   investments in/acquisitions of renewable electric production and electric and gas

     Table of Contents  

transmission projects   (  $995 million  ), increased utility construction expenditures in 2016 (  $219 million  ) and increased non-utility construction expenditures related to development of renewable electric production projects (  $70 million  ), offset in part by the proceeds from the sale of assets (  $250 million  ). In addition, the change for CECONY reflects primarily increased utility construction expenditures in 2016 (  $200 million  ), offset in part by the proceeds from the transfer of assets to NY Transco (  $122 million  ).  
    
  Cash Flows From/(Used In) Financing Activities    
  Net cash flows from financing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $  701 million   higher and $  395 million   lower, respectively, in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the   2015   period. 
    
  In June 2016, Con Edison borrowed $400 million pursuant to a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks.  The borrowing matures in 2018 and bears interest at a LIBOR plus margin of 1.00 percent. 
    
  In May 2016, Con Edison issued approximately   10 million   common shares resulting in net proceeds, after issuance expenses, of   $702 million   and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00 percent debentures, due 2021, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used in connection with the acquisition by a CET Gas subsidiary of a 50 percent equity interest in a gas pipeline and storage joint venture (see "Con Edison Transmission", below) and for general corporate purposes.  
    
  In June 2016,   CECONY issued $550 million of 3.85 percent 30-year debentures, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. In September 2016, CECONY redeemed at maturity $400 million of 5.50 percent 10-year debentures. 
    
  In June 2016, a Con Edison Solutions subsidiary borrowed $2 million pursuant to a loan agreement with a New Jersey utility. The borrowing matures in 2026, bears interest of 11.18 percent and may be repaid in cash or project Solar Renewable Energy Certificates.   In May 2016, a Con Edison Development subsidiary issued $95 million aggregate principal amount of 4.07 percent senior notes, due 2036, secured by the company's California Holdings 3 solar project. I  n February 2016, a Con Edison Development subsidiary issued $218 million aggregate principal amount of 4.21 per  cent senior notes, due 2041, secured by the company's Texas Solar 7 solar project.   In June 2015, a Con Edison Development subsidiary issued $118 million aggregate principal amount of 3.94 percent senior notes, due 2036, secured by four of the company's solar projects. 
    
  In June 2015, O R issued $120 million of 4.95 percent 30-year debentures, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. In April 2015, O R redeemed at maturity $40 million of 5.30 percent 10-year debentures. In August 2015, O R redeemed at maturity $55 million of 2.50 percent 5-year debentures and $44 million of variable rate tax-exempt 20-year debt. 
    
  Cash flows used in financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance. The commercial paper amounts outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the average daily balances for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   for Con Edison and CECONY were as follows: 

Capital Requirements and Resources 
  Con Edison has increased its estimates for capital requirements for 2016 from $4,892 million to $6,117 million. The increase reflects the $975 million purchase of a 50 percent equity interest in a gas pipeline and storage joint venture. See  Con Edison Transmission,  below. The increase also reflects increased estimates of capital expenditures by its competitive energy businesses from $985 million to $1,235 million to reflect additional renewable energy project development. See "Con Edison Development," below. The company plans to meet its 2016 capital requirements, including for maturing securities, through internally-generated funds and the issuance of securities. See "  Cash Flows From/(Used In) Financing Activities  ,"   above. In September 2016, O R agreed to issue

  Con Edison has also increased its estimates of capital expenditures by its competitive energy businesses from $360 million to $400 million for both 2017 and 2018 to reflect additional renewable energy project development. 
    
  For each of the Companies, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges (Securities and Exchange Commission basis) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the twelve months ended   December 31, 2015   was: 

For each of the Companies, the common equity ratio at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was: 

Contractual Obligations 
  Con Edison s obligations to make payments pursuant to contracts increased to $38,611 million at   September 30, 2016   from $34,884 million at   December 31, 2015   due primarily to increases in the company s long-term debt ($1,358 million, including $150 million for CECONY, see "  Cash Flows From/(Used In) Financing Activities  ," above) and interest on long-term debt ($891 million, including $704 million for CECONY). The change also reflects increases in obligations under natural gas supply, transportation and storage contracts ($1,862 million, including $1,577 million for CECONY). In addition, in October 2016, CECONY's obligations increased by $878 million reflecting the estimated aggregate annual amounts payable under the twenty-year renewal of the New York City revocable consent for the use of streets and public places for installation and operation of transformers and associated vaults and equipment.  

Other Changes in Assets and Liabilities 
  The following table shows changes in certain assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   December 31, 2015  . 

Investments

     Table of Contents  

Prepayments 
  The increase in prepayments for Con Edison and CECONY reflects primarily the portion allocable to the 2016 fourth quarter of CECONY's July 2016 payment of its New York City semi-annual property taxes. 
    
  Regulatory Asset for Unrecognized Pension and Other Postretirement Costs and Liability for Pension and Retiree Benefits 
  The decrease in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs and the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects the final actuarial valuation of the pension and other retiree benefit plans as measured at   December 31, 2015  , in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. The change in the regulatory asset also reflects the year s amortization of accounting costs. The change in the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects in part contributions to the plans made by the Utilities in 2016. See Notes   B  ,   E   and   F   to the   Third   Quarter Financial Statements. 
    
  Income Taxes Receivable 
  The decrease in income taxes receivable for Con Edison reflects primarily the refund received in February 2016 from the Internal Revenue Service as a result of the extension of bonus depreciation in December 2015. 
    
  Deferred Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits 
  The increase in the liability for deferred income taxes and investment tax credits for Con Edison and CECONY reflects primarily bonus depreciation in 2016, partially offset by the increase in deferred income tax assets associated with the federal tax attribute carryforwards related to the net operating loss and general business tax credits. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  None of the Companies  interests in variable interest entities (VIEs) meet the Securities and Exchange Commission definition of off-balance sheet arrangements. For information regarding the Companies  VIEs, see   Note M   to the   Third   Quarter Financial Statements. 

Regulatory Matters 
  In March 2016, the New York State Public Service Commission (NYSPSC) issued an order in which it approved CECONY s advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) plan for the company s electric and gas delivery businesses, subject to a cap on capital expenditures of $1,285 million. AMI components include smart meters, a communication network, information technology systems and business applications. The plan provides for full deployment of AMI to the company s customers to be implemented over a six-year period. The NYSPSC directed CECONY to submit a customer engagement plan, an update to the company s benefit cost analysis and metrics that the NYSPSC can use to monitor the success of the project. 
    
  In May 2016, the NYSPSC issued an order in its Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) proceeding adopting a ratemaking and utility revenue framework. The order indicated that utilities will have four ways of achieving earnings: traditional cost-of-service earnings; earnings tied to achievement of alternatives that reduce utility capital spending and provide definitive consumer benefit; earnings from market-facing platform activities; and transitional outcome-based performance measures. The order also indicated, among other things, that existing measures for negative revenue adjustments for utility failure to meet basic service standards should generally be retained and net utility plant reconciliations should be modified to encourage cost-effective distributed energy resources (DER) as an alternative to utility capital investment. The order directs each utility to file a system efficiency proposal; an interconnection survey process and proposed earnings adjustment mechanism; a progress report on aggregated data reporting automation; an aggregated data privacy policy statement; revisions to standby service tariffs and cost allocation matrix; one or more smart home rate demonstration proposals; and revisions to voluntary time of use rates and promotion and education tools. 
    
  In June 2016, CECONY and O R each filed initial distributed system implementation plans with the NYSPSC, pursuant to which the companies provide additional system and planning information for third-party developers to facilitate the integration of DER in the distributed system platform. 
    
  In August 2016, the NYSPSC issued an order adopting the New York State Energy Plan s goal of 50 percent of the State s electricity to be generated by renewable sources by 2030 as part of a strategy to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2030. The NYSPSC also adopted a Clean Energy Standard (CES) that  

70    

     Table of Contents  

includes renewable energy credit (REC) and zero-emissions credit (ZEC) requirements. Beginning in 2017, load serving entities (LSEs), including CECONY and O R for their full-service customers, will be required to obtain RECs and ZECs in amounts determined by the NYSPSC. LSEs may satisfy their REC obligation by either purchasing RECs acquired through central procurement by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), by self-supply through direct purchase of tradable RECs, or by making alternative compliance payments. LSEs will purchase ZECs from NYSERDA at prices determined by the NYSPSC. The order establishes an annual NYSPSC staff review and triennial NYSPSC review of the CES.

Con Edison Transmission 
  CET Electric 
  In March 2016, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a November 2015 settlement agreement applicable to three transmission projects that the NYSPSC approved in October 2013 in its proceeding to address potential needs that could arise should the Indian Point Energy Center (which is owned by Entergy Corporation subsidiaries) no longer be able to operate. CECONY developed and, in May 2016, transferred two of the projects to New York Transco LLC.  See   Note P   to the   Third   Quarter Financial Statements. The settlement agreement, among other things, provides for a 10 percent return on common equity (and/or 9.5 percent for capital costs in excess of $228 million incurred for initial commercial operation), a maximum common equity ratio of 53 percent and allocation of 63 percent of the costs of the projects to load serving entities in the CECONY and O R service areas. 
    
  CET Gas 
  In April 2016, a CET Gas subsidiary agreed with a subsidiary of Crestwood Equity Partners LP to form a joint venture to own, operate and further develop a gas pipeline and storage business located in northern Pennsylvania and southern New York. In June 2016, the transaction was substantially completed. See   Note P   to the   Third   Quarter Financial Statements. 

Financial and Commodity Market Risks 
  The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
  The Companies  interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at   September 30, 2016  , a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $2 million. Under CECONY s current gas, steam and electric rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense are reconciled to levels reflected in rates. 
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
  Con Edison s commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edison s competitive energy businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See   Note K   to the   Third   Quarter Financial Statements. 
    
  Con Edison estimates that, as of   September 30, 2016  , a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $61 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $54 million is for CECONY and $7 million is for O R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. 
    
  Con Edison s competitive energy businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices, for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level and compare the measured VaR results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  , respectively, was as follows:

     Table of Contents  

Credit Risk 
  The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. See   Note K   to the   Third   Quarter Financial Statements. 
    
  Investment Risk 
  The Companies  investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The Companies  current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 55  to 65 percent equities and 35 to 45 percent fixed income and other securities. At   September 30, 2016  , the pension plan investments consisted of 58 percent equity and 42 percent fixed income and other securities. 
    
  For the Utilities  pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. In accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between the pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. Generally, O R also defers such difference pursuant to its rate plans. 

Material Contingencies

  The Companies maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that they submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For each of the Companies, its management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, has concluded that the controls and procedures are effective to provide such reasonable assurance. Reasonable assurance is not absolute assurance, however, and there can be no assurance that any design of controls or procedures would be effective under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
  There was no change in the Companies  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Companies  most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companies  internal control over financial reporting.
