GABBIT CORP. 
 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 FOR THE NINE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2016 
   
 NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
   
  GABBIT CORP. (the  Company ) is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on August 16, 2015.  
   
  The Company intends to commence operations in the business of providing individual and group extremal tour to Austrian Alps.  
   
  The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the company s business plan.  
   
  The Company has adopted February 29 fiscal year end.  
   
   Basis of Presentation   

The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.  
   
 NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN 
   
 The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.  The Company has incurred a loss since Inception (August 16, 2015) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $3,947 as of November 30, 2016, and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business.  Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.   
   
 The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock.   
   
 NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Use of Estimates   
   
  Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management s estimates and assumptions.  
   
   Cash and Cash Equivalents   
   
  For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At November 30, 2016, the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts.  

6 

Advertising Costs   
  The Company s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense of $0 during the period from inception (August 16, 2015) to November 30, 2016.  
   
   Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share   
   
  Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.  
   
   Stock-Based Compensation   
   
  As of November 30, 2016, the Company has not issued any stock-based payments to its employees.  
  Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 718, when applicable.  To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.  
   
   Income Taxes   
   
  The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences).  The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  
   
   New Accounting Pronouncements   
   
  There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows.  
   
   Subsequent Events   
   
  The Company has evaluated all transactions from November 30, 2016 through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure consideration.  
   
  NOTE 4   CAPTIAL STOCK  
   
  The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share.   

NOTE 5   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
   
  In support of the Company s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.  

7 

Since August 16, 2015 (inception) through November 30, 2016, the Company s sole officer and director loaned the Company $942 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  As of November 30, 2016, the amount outstanding was $942. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.  
     
  NOTE 6   INCOME TAX  
   
  As of November 30, 2016, The Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $3,947 that may be available to reduce future years  taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.  

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION 
   
 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
   
 Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are  forward-looking statements  made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Act ) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as  may,   will,   expect,   believe,   anticipate,   estimate,   approximate  or  continue,  or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 
   
 GENERAL 
   
  We intend to provide group leisure tours in the Austrian Alps with extreme activities aimed at general public. We seek to plan the tours in such a way, that they might be experienced by an experienced tourist, as well as an average person. The key objectives that we plan to pursue are as follows: quality and diversity of the activities, safety of our customers.  
     
  We plan to target general worldwide public to promote tourism in the mentioned area. We choose this mountain area proceeding from our own touristic experience in this region.  
     
  Our principal office address is located at Gymnasiumstrasse 19-21, Vienna, Austria 1180. Our telephone number is +43-720-816-770. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company and have generated $5,000 in revenues as of today. We were incorporated in Nevada on August 16, 2015. On February 20, 2016, we signed the Agreement with EcoFur Ris, LLC.

RESULTS OF OPERATION 
   
 We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.

OPERATING EXPENSES

 Our net loss for the nine month period ended November 30, 2016 was $2,998 due to the factors discussed above. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
   
 NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2016 
   
 As of November 30, 2016, our total assets were $30,895 compared to $11,493 in total assets at February 29, 2016. Total assets as of November 30, 2016, comprised cash of $28,496 and $2,399 in net fixed assets while as at February 29, 2016 total assets comprised cash of $9,493 and fixed assets of $2,000.

 Stockholders  equity was $8,051 as of February 29, 2016, compared to Stockholders  equity of $29,953 as of November 30, 2016.    

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES 
   
 We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the nine month period ended November 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities were $4,997 consisting of a net loss of $2,998, reduced for cash flow purposes by non-cash depreciation expense of $501 and decrease in deferred revenue of $2,500.

 PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 
   
 We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds, further issuances of securities and loans from our principal shareholder. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

9 

Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 
   
 MATERIAL COMMITMENTS 
   
 As of November 30, 2016, we had no material commitments. 
   
 PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT 
   
 We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. 
   
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
   
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
   
 GOING CONCERN 
   
 The independent auditors' audit report accompanying our February 29, 2016 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared  assuming that we will continue as a going concern,  which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
   
 Not applicable for smaller reporting companies.  
     
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
   
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure   controls and   procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.
