(Dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data) 

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The significant accounting policies followed by MainSource Financial Group, Inc. ( Company ) for interim financial reporting are consistent with the accounting policies followed for annual financial reporting. The consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q. The interim statements do not include all information and footnotes normally included in the annual financial statements. All adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods reported have been included in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Some items in prior period financial statements were reclassified to conform to current presentation. It is suggested that these consolidated financial statements and notes be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Adoption of New Accounting Standards and Newly-Issued, Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  ASU 2016-15 adds or clarifies guidance on the presentation and classification of eight specific types of cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, with the intent of reducing diversity in practice. This ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented; however, entities may apply prospectively if retrospective application is impracticable. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13  Financial Instruments (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instrument   (  CECL ).  ASU 2016-13 requires an allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets be recognized as early as day one of the instrument.  This ASU departs from the incurred loss model which means the probability threshold is removed.  It considers more forward-looking information and requires the entity to estimate its credit losses over the life of the asset.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company will be evaluating the impact of this ASU over the next several years. 

NOTE 2 - STOCK PLANS AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION 

On January 19, 2015, the Board of Directors adopted and approved the MainSource Financial Group, Inc. 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ) which was effective following the approval of the 2015 Plan by the Company s shareholders at the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 29, 2015.  The 2015 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, share awards of restricted stock, performance share units and other equity based awards.  Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees.  An aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan.  Shares issuable under the 2015 Plan may be authorized and unissued shares of common stock or treasury shares.  The 2015 Plan was a replacement of a similar plan adopted in 2007.  The 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2007 Plan ) provided for the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock bonuses and restricted stock awards. An aggregate of 650,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan.  The 2007 Plan was in replacement of a similar plan adopted in 2003, the 2003 Stock Option Plan (the  2003 Plan ).  Any stock or option awards that were previously issued under the 2007 Plan or 2003 Plan have not been terminated as a result of the adoption of the 2015 Plan, but will continue in accordance with the applicable plan terms and the agreements pursuant to which such stock or option awards were issued.  

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes) model. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Company s common stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. Employee and director options are tracked

separately. The expected term of options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into account that the options are not transferable. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. 

All share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense over the service period (generally the vesting period) in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values.  For options with graded vesting, the Company values the stock option grants and recognizes compensation expense as if each vesting portion of the award was a single award. 

The following table summarizes stock option activity: 

The following table details stock options outstanding: 

The intrinsic value for stock options is calculated based on the exercise price of the underlying awards and the market price of our common stock as of the reporting date. The Company recorded $21 and $64 in stock compensation expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $48 and $133 in stock compensation expense during the three and nine months ended September 30 2015 to salaries and employee benefits. There were no options granted in the first nine months of 2016 or 2015.   

Unrecognized stock option compensation expense related to unvested awards for the remainder of 2016 and beyond is estimated as follows: 

During 2015 and the first and second quarters of 2016, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company granted restricted stock awards to certain executive officers and other employees pursuant to the Company s Long Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP ). Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the stock at the issue date. The value of the awards was determined by multiplying the award amount by the closing price of a share of Company common stock on the grant date. The restricted stock awards for employees vest as follows   100% on the third anniversary of the date of grant. A total of 24,152 and 16,000 shares of common stock were granted in the first and second quarters of 2016 at a weighted average cost of $21.47 and $22.57

per share, respectively.  A total of 28,955 shares of common stock were granted in the first quarter of 2015 at a weighted average cost of $19.57 per share. 

A summary of changes in the Company s nonvested restricted shares for 2016 follows: 

As of September 30, 2016, there was $1,089 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock awards granted under the 2015 Plan that will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of approximately 2.1 years. The recognized compensation costs related to the plans were $160 and $512 for the three month and nine periods ending September 30, 2016 and $143 and $447 for the three and nine months periods ending September 30, 2015. 

Additionally, in the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015, the Committee voted to grant performance share units to certain executive officers pursuant to the Company s LTIP.  The Committee established performance measures, goals and payout calibration for the Performance Share Units. At the end of each three-year performance period, the Committee will certify the results of the performance measures and goals and will pay the earned awards out in cash or shares of Company common stock. Dividends earned during each three-year performance period will be accrued and paid at the end of the performance period, based upon the final number of shares earned. The performance measures and goals are based on financial and shareholder measures, and are evaluated relative to internal goals and the performance of the Company s peers. Once the performance measures and goals were established, the Committee established threshold, target and superior levels of performance. The LTIP payout of shares will begin once the Company achieves the pre-established threshold (thus, no payout will occur if the performance is equal to or below the threshold). Each executive s target payout is achieved once the performance equals the target level, and the maximum payout is achieved once the performance equals the superior level (with interpolation between discrete points). 

The grant of Performance Share Units by the Committee is evidenced by an award agreement between the executive and the Company which provides that each executive will receive shares of Company stock when the Company s actual performance as compared to its peers and long-term goals exceeds certain thresholds, determined as of December 31, 2017 or 2018, provided the executive remains employed by the Company on such date. The executive s eligibility for the payout of shares is determined based on the following measures:

The value of the awards was determined by multiplying the award amount by the closing price of a share of Company common stock on the grant date. The performance share units are earned over the three year period of the award. A total of 16,152 performance share units were granted in the first quarter of 2016 at a weighted average cost of $21.41 per share.  A total of 16,205 performance share units were granted in the second quarter of 2015 at a weighted average cost of $19.57 per share.  Compensation expense is recognized over the three year performance period of the awards based on the fair value of the stock at the issue date and the anticipated achievement level of the target performance.  Quarterly, the

performance measures will be reevaluated and adjustments made to the expense recorded in the financial statements, if needed, to reflect the new revised achievement levels.  $55 and $137 of expense was recognized on these awards for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and $27 and $53 of expense was recognized in the three and nine months periods ending September 30, 2015.  A total of $447 will be expensed in future periods if the Target level is achieved. 

In the second quarter of 2016, members of the Board of Directors received their entire annual retainer in restricted Company stock for the following Board year ended with the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders. The 2016 award vests quarterly for all directors who remain on the Board of Directors on the vesting dates, with 25% of the award vesting on each of May 1, August 1, and November 1, 2016, and February 1, 2017. The value of the 2016 retainer award was determined by multiplying the award amount by the closing price of the stock on the date of the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders.  Additional shares were granted in June 2016 to a new director who joined the Board following the Company s acquisition of Cheviot Financial Corp.  The shares granted were pro-rated based on the new director s time on the Board. 

For all awards, other expense is recognized over the three month period of the awards based on the fair value of the stock at the issue dates. Shares awarded by quarter were as follows: 

A total of $103 and $70 was recognized as other expense in the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 respectively for these grants and $282 and $230 was recognized in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 respectively.

NOTE 3 - SECURITIES 

The amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale and related unrealized gains/losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income was as follows: 

The amortized cost and fair value of the investment securities portfolio are shown by expected maturity.  Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  Securities not due at a single maturity or with no maturity are shown separately. 

Proceeds from sales of securities available for sale were $85,738 and $139,547 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross gains of $144 and $1,515 and gross losses of $0 and $1,155 were realized on these sales during 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Income taxes on these net gains were $50 and $126 in 2016 and 2015.

Table of Contents  

Proceeds from sales of securities available for sale were $7,615 and $57,208 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross gains of $23 and $203 and gross losses of $0 and $158 were realized on these sales during 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Income taxes on these net gains were $8 and $16 in 2016 and 2015. 

Below is a summary of securities with unrealized losses as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 presented by length of time the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position. 

Other-Than-Temporary-Impairment 

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. The investment securities portfolio is evaluated for OTTI by segregating the portfolio into two general segments and applying the appropriate OTTI model. Investment securities are generally evaluated for OTTI under ASC 320. However, certain purchased beneficial interests, including non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations that had credit ratings at the time of purchase of below AA are evaluated using the model outlined in ASC 325-10  . 

In determining OTTI under ASC 320, management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. 

When OTTI occurs under either model, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current-period credit loss. If an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current-period credit loss, the OTTI shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period loss, the OTTI shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total OTTI related to   

12 

Table of Contents  

the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company s securities portfolio consisted of 938 securities, 28 of which were in an unrealized loss position.  Unrealized losses on state and municipal securities of $93 have not been recognized into income because management has the ability to hold for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value and it is unlikely that management will be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The decline in value is primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. The Company monitors the financial condition of these issuers. The fair value of these debt securities is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date. 

At September 30, 2016, almost all of the mortgage-backed securities held by the Company were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. Because the decline in fair value of approximately $3 is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and because the Company does not have the intent to sell these mortgage-backed securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016. 

The Company s collateralized mortgage obligation securities portfolio includes agency collateralized mortgage obligations with a market value of $26,636     which had unrealized losses of approximately $145     at September 30, 2016. As noted above, the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity and not credit quality. The Company monitors to insure it has adequate credit support and as of September 30, 2016, the Company believes there is no OTTI and does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. All securities are investment grade.  

NOTE 4 - LOANS AND ALLOWANCE

The following table presents the balance in the allowance for loan losses and the recorded investment by portfolio segment and based on impairment method at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The allowance for loans collectively evaluated for impairment consists of reserves on groups of similar loans based on historical loss experience adjusted for other factors, as well as reserves on certain loans that are classified but determined not to be impaired based on an analysis which incorporates probability of default with a loss given default scenario. The reserves on these loans totaled $2,410 at September 30, 2016 and $1,583 at December 31, 2015. 

In connection with the acquisition of Cheviot Financial Corp. (see Note 12), the Company acquired $16,175 of purchased credit impaired loans with $4,615 of non accretable yield and no accretable yield.  The Company provided no allowance for loan losses on these loans at September 30, 2016. 

The recorded investment in loans excludes accrued interest receivable due to immateriality.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

From time to time, the terms of certain loans are modified as troubled debt restructurings. The modification of the terms of such loans includes one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan or an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. 

The total of troubled debt restructurings at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $6,669 and $8,389 respectively. The Company has allocated $501 of specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings as of September 30, 2016.

A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms.  The troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted described above did not increase the allowance for loan losses or result in any charge offs during the three or nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company s internal underwriting policy. 

The terms of certain other loans were modified during the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 that did not meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring. These modified loans had a total recorded investment of $7,895 and $5,511 for the three month period ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. These modified loans had a total recorded investment of $10,784 and $6,586 for the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.  The modification of these loans involved either a modification of the terms of a loan to borrowers who were not experiencing financial difficulties or a delay in a payment that was considered to be significant. 

Credit Quality Indicators 

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of the borrower to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes commercial and commercial real estate loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes credit relationships with an outstanding balance greater than $1 million on an annual basis. Only credit relationships over $250 are risk graded.  The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 

23 

Table of Contents  

Special Mention   Loans classified as special mention have above average risk that requires management s ongoing attention. The borrower may have demonstrated the inability to generate profits or to maintain net worth, chronic delinquency and/or a demonstrated lack of willingness or capacity to meet obligations. 

Substandard   Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are classified by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Non-accrual   Loans classified as non-accrual are loans where the further accrual of interest is stopped because payment in full of principal and interest is not expected. In most cases, the principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more. 

As of September 30, 2016, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows: 

At December 31, 2015, the risk category of loans by class of loans was as follows:

Loans not analyzed individually as part of the above described process are classified by delinquency. These loans are primarily smaller ( $250) commercial, smaller commercial real estate ( $250), residential mortgage and consumer loans. All commercial, commercial real estate, consumer loans fully or partially secured by 1-4  family residential real estate that are 60-89 days will be classified as Watch. If loans are greater than 90 days past due, they will be classified as Substandard. Smaller commercial and commercial real estate loans on non-accrual are included in the non-accrual tables above.  Consumer loans not secured by 1-4 family residential real estate that are 60-119 days past due will be classified Substandard while loans greater than 119 days will be classified as Loss and are subsequently charged off. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the grading of loans by category of loans is as follows:

NOTE 7 - EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Earnings per common share (EPS) were computed as follows: 

There were no antidilutive options in the three month periods ending September 30, 2016 or 2015. 

Stock options for 10,210 common shares in 2015 were not considered in computing diluted earnings per share because they were antidilutive.  There were no  antidilutive options in 2016. 

NOTE 8   FAIR VALUE 

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 

Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 

The fair values of securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs) or using market data utilizing pricing models, primarily Interactive Data Corporation (IDC),   

27 

Table of Contents  

that vary based upon asset class and include available trade, bid, and other market information. Matrix pricing is used for most municipals, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. The grouping of securities is done according to insurer, credit support, state of issuance, and rating to incorporate additional spreads and municipal curves. For the general market municipals, the Thomson Municipal Market Data curve is used to determine the initial curve for determining the price, movement, and yield relationships with the municipal market (Level 2 inputs). Level 3 securities are largely comprised of small, local municipality issuances.  Fair values are derived through consideration of funding type, maturity and other features of the issuance, and include reviewing financial statements, earnings forecasts, industry trends and the valuation of comparative issuers.  In most cases, the book value of the security is used as the fair value as meaningful pricing data is not readily available. Twice a year, a sample of prices supplied by the pricing agent is validated by comparison to prices obtained from other third party sources. 

The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals or industry accepted valuation methods. In a limited number of situations, the Company s appraisal department is determining the value of appraisal.  These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the loan officers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available as well as costs to sell. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value.  Impaired loans are evaluated quarterly for additional impairment and take into account changing market conditions, specific information in the market the property is located, and the overall economic climate as well as overall changes in the credit.  The Company s Appraisal Manager has the overall responsibility for all appraisals.  The Company s loan officer responsible for the loan, the special assets officer, as well as the senior officers of the Company review the adjustments made to the appraisal for market and disposal costs on the loan. 

The fair value of other real estate owned is measured based on the value of the collateral securing those assets and is determined using several methods. The fair value of real estate is generally determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers (third party). The appraisers typically determine the value of the real estate by utilizing an income or market valuation approach. If an appraisal is not available, the fair value may be determined by using a cash flow analysis.  Appraisals for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company.  Once received, a member of the Appraisal Department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry-wide statistics.  Fair values are reviewed on at least an annual basis.  The Company normally applies an internal discount to the value of appraisals used in the fair value evaluation of OREO.  The deductions take into account changing business factors and market conditions as well as disposal costs.  As noted in the impaired loans discussion above, the Company s Appraisal Manager has the overall responsibility for all appraisals.  The Appraisal Manager reports to the Vice President of Credit Administration who reports to the Chief Credit Officer of the Company. 

The fair value of servicing rights is based on a valuation model from a third party that calculates the present value of estimated net servicing income.  The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income.  The Company is able to compare the valuation model inputs and results to widely available published industry data for reasonableness (Level 3 inputs). 

The fair value of mortgage banking derivatives are based on derivative valuation models using market data inputs as of the valuation date (Level 2). The mortgage banking derivative is classified as Interest receivable and other assets on the balance sheet. 

The fair value of interest rate swaps are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2).  The fair value of derivatives are classified as Interest receivable and other assets and Other liabilities on the balance sheet.

The Company s state and municipal security valuations were supported by analysis prepared by an independent third party.  Fair values are derived through consideration of funding type, maturity and other features of the issuance, and include reviewing financial statements, earnings forecasts, industry trends and the valuation of comparative issuers.  In most cases, the book value of the security is used as the fair value as meaningful pricing data is not readily available.

At December 31, 2015, impaired loans had a gross carrying amount of $2,393 with a valuation allowance of $1,253. A breakdown of these loans by portfolio class at September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

Impaired tranches of servicing rights were carried at a fair value of $3,161, which is made up of the gross outstanding balance of $3,536 net of a valuation allowance of $375.  A $125 charge was made to the valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2016 and a charge of $175 was made to the valuation account in the first nine months of 2016.   A $25 credit to earnings was made to the valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2015 and a credit of $175 was made to the valuation allowance in the first nine months of 2015.  At December 31, 2015, impaired servicing rights were carried at a fair value of $531 which was made up of the gross outstanding balance of $731, net of a valuation allowance of $200.

The following table presents quantitative information about level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Impaired commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, and other real estate owned that are deemed collateral dependent are valued based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. These estimates are based on the most recently available appraisals with certain adjustments made based on the type of property, age of appraisal, current status of the property and other related factors to estimate the current value of the collateral.  The fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is valued based on present value of future cash flows to be received taking into account the coupon rate on the mortgage as well as estimated prepayment speeds.

Table of Contents  

The difference between the loan balance included above and the amounts shown in Note 4 are the impaired loans discussed above. 

The methods and assumptions, not previously presented, used to estimate fair values are described as follows: 

(a) Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The carrying amounts of cash, short-term instruments, and interest bearing time deposits approximate fair values and are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2. Noninterest bearing deposits are Level 1 whereas interest bearing, due from bank accounts, and fed funds sold are Level 2. 

(b) FHLB and other stock 

It is not practical to determine the fair value of FHLB stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. 

(c) Loans, Net 

Fair values of loans are estimated as follows: For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification. Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification. Loans held for sale is estimated based upon binding contracts and quotes from third party investors resulting in a Level 2 classification.  Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value as described previously. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price. 

(d) Deposits 

The fair values disclosed for non-interest bearing deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date resulting in a Level 1 classification. The carrying amounts of variable rate interest bearing deposits approximate their fair values at the reporting date resulting in a Level 1 classification.  Fair values for fixed rate interest bearing deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flows calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

(e) Borrowings 

The fair values of the Company s FHLB advances are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates resulting in a Level 2 classification.

The fair values of the Company s subordinated debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

The fair values of the Company s Other borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

(f) Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable 

The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value resulting in a Level 2 or Level 3 classification based on the level of the asset or liability with which the accrual is associated. 

NOTE 9   REGULATORY CAPITAL 

Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies and are assigned to a capital category. The assigned capital category is largely determined by four ratios that are calculated according to the regulations. The ratios are intended to measure capital relative to assets and credit risk associated with those assets and off-balance sheet exposures. The capital category assigned to an entity can also be affected by qualitative judgments made by regulatory agencies about the risk inherent in the entity s activities that are not part of the calculated ratios. 

On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule that establishes an integrated regulatory capital framework. The rule implements the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. In general, under the new rules, minimum requirements have increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. Consistent with the international Basel framework, the new rules include a new minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets that applies to all supervised financial institutions. The rule also raises the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4% to 6% and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking organizations.   Additionally, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, the Company will be required to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized regulatory capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from 0.00% in 2015 to 2.50% in 2019. At September 30, 2016, the capital conservation buffer is 0.625%. At September 30, 2016, the capital levels for the Company and its subsidiary bank remained well in excess of the minimum amounts needed for capital adequacy purposes.   The new rules also change the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and became effective on January 1, 2015. 

Actual and required capital amounts and ratios are presented below: 

34 

Table of Contents  

Management believes as of September 30, 2016, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject to be considered well-capitalized. The Company is a source of additional financial strength to the Bank with its $4,000 in cash and its ability to downstream additional capital to the Bank. 

NOTE 10   INCOME TAXES 

In accordance with ASC 740-270-50-1, Accounting for Interim Reporting, the provision for income taxes was recorded at September 30, 2016 and 2015 based on the current estimate of the effective annual rate.  The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 26.0% versus 24.1% for the same period 2015.  For the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, the effective tax rate was 23.5% versus 22.0% respectively.  The increase in the third quarter effective tax rate was due to the increase in pre-tax earnings while tax exempt interest remained flat.  The Company s effective tax rate was lower than its blended statutory rate due to the Company s investments in tax-exempt securities, tax-exempt loans, company-owned life insurance, and a subsidiary company domiciled in a state with no state or local income tax.  

NOTE 11   DERIVATIVES 

The Bank executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management strategies. These derivative positions relate to transactions in which the Bank enters into an interest rate swap with a customer while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with another financial institution.  The Bank agrees to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the customer on the same notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the same time, the Bank agrees to pay another financial institution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. The transaction allows the customer to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate. Because the terms of the swaps with the customers and the other financial institutions offset each other, with the only difference being counterparty credit risk, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts are not materially different and do not significantly impact the Bank s results of operations.  The notional amounts of these interest rate swaps and the offsetting counterparty derivative instruments were $124.1 million at September 30, 2016 and $53.7 million at December 31, 2015. 

Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Bank s exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal or contract amounts. There are provisions in the agreements with the counterparties that allow for certain unsecured credit exposure up to an agreed threshold. Exposures in excess of the agreed thresholds are collateralized. In addition, the Bank minimizes credit risk through credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures.

NOTE 12   ACQUISITION  

On May 20, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Cheviot Financial Corp. ( Cheviot ) and its subsidiary Cheviot Savings Bank in exchange for stock and cash.  Shareholders of Cheviot were entitled to merger consideration in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.    At the time of the merger, stockholders of Cheviot received either 0.6916 shares of the Company s common stock or $15.00 in cash for each share of Cheviot common stock owned, subject to proration provisions specified in the Merger Agreement that provide for a targeted aggregate split of total consideration of approximately 50% common stock and approximately 50% cash.    In total, the Company issued 2,351,816 shares of common stock and paid $49.7 million in cash to the former shareholders of Cheviot. 

With the acquisition, the Company expanded its presence in the greater Cincinnati area.  The acquisition offers the Company the opportunity to increase profitability by introducing new products and services to the acquired customer base and adding new customers in the expanded region.  Cheviot s results of operations were included in the Company s results beginning May 21, 2016.  Acquisition-related costs of $601 and $6,964 were included in the Company s income statement for the three month and nine month period ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  The fair value of the common shares issued as part of the consideration paid for Cheviot was determined on the basis of the closing price of the Company s common shares on the acquisition date.

Goodwill of $24,936 arising from the acquisition consisted largely of synergies and the cost savings resulting from the combining of the operations of the companies.  Goodwill will not be deductible for income tax purposes.  The following table summarizes the consideration paid for Cheviot and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition date:  

The Company will be completing its final fair value adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

The fair value of net assets acquired includes fair value adjustments to certain receivables that were not considered impaired as of the acquisition date. The fair value adjustments were determined using discounted contractual cash flows.  However, the Company believes that all contractual cash flows related to these financial instruments will be collected. As such, these receivables were not considered impaired at the acquisition date and were not subject to the guidance relating to purchased credit impaired loans, which have shown evidence of credit deterioration since origination. Receivables acquired that were not subject to these requirements include non-impaired loans and customer receivables with a fair value and gross contractual amounts receivable of $344,639 and $350,869 on the date of acquisition.

Table of Contents  

The following table presents pro forma information as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of 2015.  The pro forma information includes adjustments for interest income on loans and securities acquired, amortization of intangibles arising from the transaction, depreciation expense on property acquired, interest expense on deposits acquired, and the related income tax effects.  The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the transaction been effected on the assumed dates. 

Acquisition costs of $460 and $4,801, net of taxes, were excluded from the above table in the three month period ending September 30, 2016 and nine month period ending September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Two putative class action lawsuits were filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton, Ohio, Civil Division, challenging the proposed merger and naming as defendants Cheviot, its directors, and MainSource (collectively, the  defendants ).

Steven Hausfeld, et al.  , Case No. A1600936 (filed February 16, 2016) (together, the  Actions ). On February 29, 2016, each plaintiff filed an amended complaint.  On March 24, 2016, the court consolidated the actions under   Raymond J. Neiheisel v. Cheviot Financial Corp., et al.  , Case No. A1600359 (collectively, the  Actions ). The amended consolidated complaint alleges, among other things, that the directors of Cheviot breached their fiduciary duties of due care, independence, good faith and fair dealing to the stockholders of Cheviot, that the consideration to be received by the stockholders is inadequate and undervalues Cheviot, that the Merger Agreement includes improper deal-protection devices that purportedly lock up the Merger and may operate to prevent other bidders from making successful competing offers for Cheviot, that the deal protection devices unreasonably inhibit the ability of the directors of Cheviot to act with respect to investigating and pursuing superior proposals and alternatives and that the Merger Agreement involves conflicts of interest. The complaint further alleges that Cheviot and MainSource aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by the directors of Cheviot. The amended consolidated complaint also alleges that the registration statement on Form S-4, initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on February 11, 2016 in connection with the Merger, provides materially misleading and incomplete information rendering the stockholders of Cheviot unable to make an informed decision with respect to the Merger. 

On April 21, 2016, defendants and lead plaintiffs entered into a memorandum of understanding ( MOU ), which provides for the settlement of the Actions.   The settlement contemplated by the MOU is subject to confirmatory discovery and customary conditions, including court approval following notice to Cheviot s stockholders. If the settlement is finally approved by the court, it will resolve and release all claims by stockholders of Cheviot challenging any aspect of the merger, the merger agreement, and any disclosure made in connection therewith.  The terms of the settlement were disclosed to former Cheviot stockholders pursuant to a Notice mailed on September 27, 2016.  The court is scheduled to consider the final settlement at a hearing to be held on December 2, 2016.   

The Company does not anticipate a material financial impact as a result of the Actions, the MOU, or the settlement.

Results of Operations 

Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $11,696 compared to net income of $9,111 for the third quarter of 2015. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to increases in net interest income of $4,902, mortgage banking of $332, and interchange income of $621.  The increase in mortgage banking was the result of the continued low interest rate environment which continued to extend the refinancing activity.  The increase in interchange income is a result of the Company converting its debit cards from Visa to MasterCard which has resulted in a higher interchange rate as well as the higher number of debit cards in use with the acquisition of Cheviot in the second quarter of 2016 and the acquisition of the five Old National Bank branches in the third quarter of 2015. Offsetting these positive items to net income were increases in the loan loss provision of $650,  a decrease in services charges of $406, an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $2,012,  an increase in occupancy expenses of $348, and an increase in equipment expenses of $492. The increases in salaries and benefits, occupancy expenses, and equipment expenses are the result of the aforementioned acquisitions.  The increase in the allowance for loan losses is a result of organic loan growth in the quarter. Diluted earnings per common share for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $0.48, a $0.06 increase from the $0.42 reported in the same period a year ago. Key measures of the financial performance of the Company are return on average shareholders  equity and return on average assets. Return on average shareholders  equity was 10.19% for the third quarter of 2016 while return on average assets was 1.16% for the same period, compared to 9.71% and 1.10% respectively, in the third quarter of 2015. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net income was $26,579  compared to net income of $26,434 for the same period a year ago. The increase in net income was again primarily attributable to the increases in net interest income of $9,074 and interchange income of $1,872 as well as a prepayment penalty on a FHLB advance of $0 compared to $2,364

taken in the first quarter of 2015.  These items were offset by increases in salaries and benefits of $4,245, occupancy expenses of $601, equipment expenses of $1,112, expenses related to the acquisition of Cheviot of $6,347, and a reduction in service charges of $624.  Diluted earnings per common share was $1.15 for the first nine months of 2016, a $0.06 decrease from the $1.21 reported in the same period a year ago. Key measures of the financial performance of the Company are return on average shareholders  equity and return on average assets. Return on average shareholders  equity was 8.45% for the first nine months of 2016 while return on average assets was 0.96% for the same period, compared to 9.57% and 1.10% respectively, in the first nine months of 2015. 

Net Interest Income 

The volume and yield of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities influence net interest income. Net interest income reflects the mix of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities that fund earning assets, as well as interest spreads between the rates earned on these assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Third quarter net interest income of $30,990 in 2016 was an increase of 18.8% versus the third quarter of 2015. Average earning assets were $639 million higher in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 with the majority of the increase attributable to loan growth and securities growth. The growth came from the acquisition of Cheviot in the second quarter of 2016, the acquisition of five Old National branches in the third quarter of 2015 as well as from organic loan growth.  Also affecting margin was an increase in average demand deposits of $109 million.  Net interest margin, on a fully-taxable equivalent basis, was 3.62% for the third quarter of 2016, a ten basis point decrease compared to 3.72% for the same period a year ago and one basis point decrease on a linked quarter basis. 

Net interest income was $9,074 higher in the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015.  Average earning assets were $441 million higher in the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015 with the majority of the increase again attributable to loan growth and securities growth.  Also affecting margin was an increase in average demand deposits of $103 million.  Net interest margin, on a fully-taxable equivalent basis, was 3.64% for the first nine months of 2016, a twelve basis point decrease compared to 3.76% for the same period a year ago.

Non-interest Income 

Third quarter non-interest income for 2016 was $13,914 compared to $13,344 for the third quarter of 2015.  Contributing to the increase of $570 was an increase in interchange income of $621 and mortgage banking of $332 offset by a reduction in service charges on deposit accounts of $406.  The Company switched its debit cards from VISA to MasterCard in late 2015 which resulted in a higher interchange rate.  The continued low interest rate environment has kept mortgage rates low. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest income was $39,241 compared to $37,604 for the first nine months of 2015.  Contributing to the increase of $1,637 was an increase in interchange income of $1,872. 

Non-interest Expense 

The Company s non-interest expense was $28,941 for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $26,635 for the same period in 2015.  The primary reasons for the increase were increases in salaries and employee benefits of $2,012, net occupancy expenses of $348, and equipment expenses of $492.  The increases  were related to the acquisition of Cheviot in the second quarter of 2016 as well as the acquisition of five Old National Bank branches in the third quarter of 2015.  The Company s efficiency ratio was 61.9% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 64.7% for the same period a year ago. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest expense was $89,195 compared to $79,382 for the first nine months of 2015.  The primary reasons for the increase of $9,813 were the increases in expenses related to the acquisition of Cheviot of $6,347, increases in salaries and employee benefits of $4,245,  occupancy expenses of $601, and equipment expenses of $1,112. Offsetting these increases was a prepayment penalty on the repayment of a FHLB advance of $2,364 taken in the first quarter of 2015.  The Company s efficiency ratio was 68.4% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 66.6% for the same period a year ago.

Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 26.0% versus 24.1% for the same period  of 2015.  The increase was due to the increase in pre-tax income in the second quarter of 2016 with tax exempt income remaining flat. 

The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was 23.5% versus 22.0% for the same period of 2015.  

The Company s effective tax rate was lower than its blended statutory rate due to the Company s investments in tax-exempt securities, tax-exempt loans, company-owned life insurance, and a subsidiary company domiciled in a state with no state or local income tax. 

Financial Condition 

Total assets at September 30, 2016 were $4,013,943, a 18.6% increase from total assets of $3,385,408 as of December 31, 2015.  The large increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of Cheviot in the second quarter of 2016.  Average earning assets represented 90.3% of average total assets for the third quarter of 2016 and 90.4% for the same period in 2015. Average loans represented 83.0%  of average deposits in the third quarter of 2016 and 78.7% for the comparable period in 2015.  Average loans as a percent of average assets were 64.3% and 62.3% for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Deposits increased significantly at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.  All categories of deposits increased due to the acquisition of Cheviot.   

Shareholders  equity was $460 million on September 30, 2016 compared to $381 million on December 31, 2015.  Book value (shareholders  equity) per common share was $19.12 at September 30, 2016 versus $17.67 at year-end 2015. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased book value per share by $0.91 at September 30, 2016 and increased book value per share by $0.58 at December 31, 2015.  Depending on market conditions, the unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale can cause fluctuations in shareholders  equity. 

Loans, Credit Risk and the Allowance and Provision for Probable Loan Losses 

Loans remain the Company s largest concentration of assets and, by their nature, carry a higher degree of risk. The loan underwriting standards observed by the Bank are viewed by management as a means of controlling problem loans and the resulting charge-offs.  The Company believes credit risks may be elevated if undue concentrations of loans in specific industry segments and to out-of-area borrowers are incurred. Accordingly, the Company s Board of Directors regularly monitors such concentrations to determine compliance with its loan allocation policy. The Company believes it has no undue concentrations of loans. 

Management maintains a list of loans warranting either the assignment of a specific reserve amount or other special administrative attention. This watch list, together with a listing of all classified loans, nonaccrual loans and delinquent loans, is reviewed monthly by management and the Board of Directors. Additionally, the Company evaluates its consumer and residential real estate loan pools for probable losses incurred based on historical trends, adjusted by current delinquency and non-performing loan levels. 

The Company has both internal and external loan review personnel who annually review approximately 50% of all loans. External loan review personnel examine the top 75 commercial credit relationships. This equates to approximately all relationships above $3,675. 

The ability to absorb loan losses promptly when problems are identified is invaluable to a banking organization. Most often, losses incurred as a result of prompt, aggressive collection actions are much lower than losses incurred after prolonged legal proceedings. Accordingly, the Company observes the practice of quickly initiating stringent collection efforts in the early stages of loan delinquency.

Total loans (excluding loans held for sale) increased $429,515 from year end 2015.  $358,535 of the increase came from the Cheviot acquisition.  Residential real estate loans continue to represent a significant portion of the total loan portfolio. Such loans represented 24.0% of total loans at September 30, 2016 and 20.4% at December 31, 2015. On September 30, 2016, the Company had $6,977 of loans held for sale, which was a $556 decrease from the year-end balance of $7,533. The Company generally retains the servicing rights on mortgages sold. 

Loans are placed on  non-accrual  status when, in management s judgment, the collateral value and/or the borrower s financial condition does not justify accruing interest. As a general rule, commercial and real estate loans are reclassified to nonaccrual status at or before becoming 90 days past due. Interest previously recorded is reversed and charged against current income. Subsequent interest payments collected on nonaccrual loans are thereafter applied as a reduction of the loan s principal balance. Non-performing loans were as follows (non-accrual loans + loans past due 90 days and still accruing + troubled debt restructurings): 

Of the $18,277 of non-performing loans at September 30, 2016, $5,532 had a specific reserve allocated of $1,252. 

A reconciliation of the non-performing assets for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

The large decrease in TDR s in 2015 is due to the sale of two large loans in 2015. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had two non-accrual loans over $500.  This was the same number at December 31, 2015. These loans are real estate backed loans. The Company is working with these borrowers in an attempt to minimize its losses. In the course of resolving problem loans, the Company may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. The Company attempts to work out an alternative payment schedule with the borrower in order to avoid foreclosure actions. Any loans that are modified are reviewed by the Company to identify if a troubled debt restructuring has occurred, which is when for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, the Company grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status and could include reduction of the stated interest rate, other than normal market rate

adjustments, extension of maturity dates, or reduction of principal balance or accrued interest. The decision to restructure a loan, versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan, may benefit the Company by increasing the ultimate probability of collection. The Company reviews each relationship before it grants the concession to ensure the creditor can comply with the new terms. To date, most of the concessions have been extensions of maturity dates. 

The Company saw an  increase in its Special Mention and Substandard Loans in the third quarter of 2016.  These loans increased $13,679 from the end of 2015, with $12,774 of the increase due to the acquisition of Cheviot.   

The provision for loan losses was $150 in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $800 for the same period in 2015 and $205 for the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in provision expense from the second quarter of 2015 was primarily due to the improvement in credit metrics as well a net recovery on charge-offs for the quarter.  For the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, the provision for loan loss was $855 and $800, respectively.  The slight increase in provision expense from 2015 was primarily due to the growth in loan balances.  The amount of new non-accrual loans in the third quarter of 2016 was approximately 16% lower than the second quarter of 2016. 

The Company realized net recoveries of $210 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to net charge-offs of $1,250 for the same period a year ago.  The net recovery was due to the recoveries of three large credits that were written off in a prior quarter.  For the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, net charge-offs were $1,047 and $2,027. 

The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed at least quarterly. The determination of the provision amount in any period is based upon management s continuing review and evaluation of loan loss experience, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, classified loans including non-accrual and impaired loans, current economic conditions, the amount of loans presently outstanding, and the amount and composition of loan growth. The allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2016 was considered adequate by management.  The allowance for loan losses was $21,828 as of September 30, 2016 and represented 0.84% of total outstanding loans compared to $22,020 as of December 31, 2015 or 1.02% of total outstanding loans.  The decrease in the percentage was due primarily to the large increase of loans acquired from the Cheviot acquisition which were recorded at fair value with no associated allowance. 

Investment Securities 

Investment securities offer flexibility in the Company s management of interest rate risk and are an important source of liquidity as a response to changing characteristics of assets and liabilities. The Company s investment policy prohibits trading activities and does not allow investment in high-risk derivative products, junk bonds or foreign investments. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $1,025,048 of investment securities. All of these securities were classified as  available for sale  ( AFS ) and were carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a separate component of shareholders  equity. An unrealized pre-tax gain of $33,510 was recorded to adjust the AFS portfolio to current market value at September 30, 2016, compared to an unrealized pre-tax gain of $19,422 at December 31, 2015. Unrealized losses on AFS securities have not been recognized into income because management does not intend to sell and does not expect to be required to sell these securities for the foreseeable future and the decline in fair value is largely due to temporary illiquidity and not necessarily the expected cash flows of the individual securities. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity dates.  All securities in the Company s portfolio are performing as expected with no disruption in cash flows and all rated securities are rated investment grade. 

Sources of Funds 

The Company relies primarily on customer deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and shareholders  equity to fund earning assets. FHLB advances, fed funds sold, and lines of credit are also used to provide additional funding. 

Deposits generated within local markets provide the major source of funding for earning assets. Average total deposits funded 85.9% and 87.7% of total average earning assets for the nine month periods ending September 30 2016 and 2015. Total interest-bearing deposits averaged 76.9% and 78.0% of average total deposits for the nine month periods ending   

47 

Table of Contents  

September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management constantly strives to increase the percentage of transaction-related deposits to total deposits due to the positive effect on earnings. 

The Company had long term FHLB advances of $259,638 outstanding at September 30, 2016. These advances have interest rates ranging from 0.97% to 4.07%.  These advances were long term advances with approximately $10,000 maturing in 2016, $20,000 maturing in 2017, $45,000 maturing in 2018, and $185,000 maturing in 2019 and beyond. 

The Company has short term FHLB advances of $54,000 outstanding at September 30, 2016 at an interest rate of 0.67%.  These advances have a maturity of six month or less. 

The Company has repurchase agreements totally $34,076 at September 30, 2016.  The agreements are one day in length. 

The Company also obtained a $30,000 line of credit that was entered in the second quarter of 2016 that has a current balance of $20,000 and an interest rate of 2.75%. 

Capital Resources 

Total shareholders  equity was $459,608 at September 30, 2016, which was an increase of $78,248 compared to the $381,360 of shareholders  equity at December 31, 2015. The increase in shareholders  equity was primarily attributable to the Company s acquisition of Cheviot of $51,387 as well as net income of $26,579, activity in stock option and restricted stock programs of $1,902, and other comprehensive income of $9,158, offset by common dividends paid of $10,445 and purchase of stock in connection with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock of $333 for the first nine months of 2016. 

The Federal Reserve Board and other regulatory agencies have adopted risk-based capital guidelines that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items. The Company s core capital consists of shareholders  equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income/loss, while Tier 1 capital consists of core capital less goodwill and intangibles. Trust preferred securities qualify as Tier 1 capital or core capital with respect to the Company under the risk-based capital guidelines established by the Federal Reserve. Under such guidelines, capital received from the proceeds of the sale of trust preferred securities cannot constitute more than 25% of the total core capital of the Company. Consequently, the amount of trust preferred securities in excess of the 25% limitation constitutes Tier 2 capital of the Company. Total regulatory capital consists of Tier 1, certain debt instruments and a portion of the allowance for loan losses. On January 1, 2015 the Federal Reserve established an integrated regulatory framework that required a new ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets as well raising the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets.  At September 30, 2016, Tier 1 capital to total average assets was 9.6%. Common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets was 12.4%.  Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets was 13.9%. Total capital to risk-adjusted assets was 14.7%. All four ratios exceed all required ratios established for bank holding companies.    Additionally, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, the Company will be required to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized regulatory capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from 0.00% in 2015 to 2.50% in 2019. At September 30, 2016, the capital conservation buffer is 0.625%.  The capital levels for the Company and its subsidiary bank remained well in excess of the minimum amounts needed for capital adequacy purposes.    Risk-adjusted capital levels of the Bank exceed regulatory definitions of well-capitalized institutions. 

The Company declared and paid common dividends of $0.15 per share in the third quarter of 2016 versus $0.14 per share for the third quarter of 2015.  The Company has increased its common dividend in the last few quarters as its net income has increased. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient cash levels to fund operations and to meet the requirements of borrowers, depositors, and creditors. Higher levels of liquidity bear higher corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets, and higher interest expense involved in extending liability maturities. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, loans and securities maturing within one year, and money market   

48

instruments. In addition, the Company holds AFS securities maturing after one year, which can be sold to meet liquidity needs. 

Maintaining a relatively stable funding base, which is achieved by diversifying funding sources and extending the contractual maturity of liabilities, supports liquidity and limits reliance on volatile short-term purchased funds. Short-term funding needs arise from declines in deposits or other funding sources, funding of loan commitments and requests for new loans. The Company s strategy is to fund assets to the maximum extent possible with core deposits that provide a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. Average core deposits funded approximately 81.5% of total earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 83.3% for the same period in 2015. 

Management believes the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet all reasonable borrower, depositor, and creditor needs in the present economic environment. In addition, the Bank has access to the Federal Home Loan Bank for borrowing purposes. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Asset/liability management strategies are developed by the Company to manage market risk. Market risk is the risk of loss in financial instruments including investments, loans, deposits and borrowings arising from adverse changes in prices/rates. Interest rate risk is the Company s primary market risk exposure, and represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates. 

Effective asset/liability management requires the maintenance of a proper ratio between maturing or repriceable interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the Company s earnings, the Company monitors interest rate risk through computer-assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income. The Company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios. The Company s objective is to actively manage its asset/liability position within a one-year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax-equivalent net interest income within that interval. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Ris  k 

Market risk of the Company encompasses exposure to both liquidity and interest rate risk and is reviewed monthly by the Asset/Liability Committee and quarterly by the Credit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.

There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s third fiscal quarter of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
