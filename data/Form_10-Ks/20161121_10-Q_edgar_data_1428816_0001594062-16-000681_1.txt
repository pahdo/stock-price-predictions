Note 1   Description of business and basis of presentation 

Organization and nature of business 

Epoxy, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 13, 2007 as Rioridge Resources Corp. On July 22, 2008, the Company changed its name to Neohydro Technologies Corp. 

On August 1, 2014, the Company s name changed from Neohydro Technologies Corp. to Epoxy, Inc.  in furtherance of actions taken on May 23, 2014, when the Board of Directors of the Company (the   Board  ) approved, and recommended to the Majority Stockholders that they approve the name change. On May 27, 2014, the Majority Stockholders approved the name change by written consent in lieu of a meeting, in accordance with Nevada law. On August 4, 2014, the Company submitted the name change to FINRA for their review and approval, as well as the approval of a symbol change from NHYT to EPXY.   The Company filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada changing our name to Epoxy, Inc. effective on August 1, 2014. 

On September 28, 2016 the Company s board of directors and majority shareholder approved an increase of the Company s authorized share capital from 850,000,000 common shares to 1,950,000,000 common shares.  The Company filed the amendment with the State of Nevada on November 21, 2016. 

The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Couponz, Inc., is the developer of Epoxy app, an application or "app" for iPhone iOS and Android operating systems. Epoxy is an innovative smart phone application designed and created to conveniently connect business owners and consumers in order to ease marketing frustrations. The mobile app gives loyal customers the ease of keeping track of rewards and punch cards all in one place while also giving opportunities to review and share businesses with friends. In turn, Epoxy provides businesses the ability to reward customers, share offers, and deliver information about special events with their customers. 

Financial Statements Presented 

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 210 8-03 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.  For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016. 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period s financial statements to conform to the current period s presentation. 

Note 2   Going Concern 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used net cash in operations of $86,364. In addition, the Company had a working capital deficit as of September 30, 2016. The Company believes that its existing capital resources may not be adequate to enable it to execute its business plan. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company estimates that it will require additional cash resources during 2016 based on its current operating plan and condition. The Company expects cash flows from operating activities to improve, primarily as a result of an increase in revenue and a decrease in certain operating expenses, although there can be no assurance thereof. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. If we fail to generate positive cash flow or obtain additional financing, when required, we may have to modify, delay, or abandon some or all of our business and expansion plans.

Note 3- Fair Value Measurements 

FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. FASB ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. 

If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. 

The following table provides a summary of the fair value of our derivative liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Note 4- Loans Payable 

On July 13, 2016 a total of $15,000 in principal and $6,031 in accrued interest payable to Andara Investments Limited (formerly known as Adam s Ale) (Loan #1 and Loan #3 below) was acquired by GW Holdings Group LLC.  The Company issued a replacement note in the principal amount of $21,031 to GW on July 21, 2016 which convertible note bears interest at 8% per annum and is due on July 13, 2017. Interest shall accrue from the advancement date and shall be payable on maturity. Any portion of the loan and unpaid interest are convertible at any time at the option of the lender into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price of a 52% discount to the lowest trading prices for the previous twenty (20) trading days to the date of conversion.

Note 4- Loans Payable (continued) 

Note 5- Convertible Notes 

On November 27, 2012, the Company entered into certain convertible loan agreements with four (4) investors. The Company received a total of $125,000 which bears interest at 10% per annum and is due on November 27, 2015. Interest shall accrue from the advancement date and shall be payable quarterly. Any portion of the loan and unpaid interest are convertible at any time at the option of the lender into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $0.0005 per share. The Company recognized the intrinsic value of the embedded beneficial conversion feature of $125,000 as additional paid-in capital and reduced the carrying value of the convertible debenture to $nil. The carrying value will be accreted over the term of the convertible debentures up to its face value of total of $125,000. 

On August 1, 2014 the Company successfully amended the terms of certain convertible loan agreements with four (4) investors for a total of $125,000 due and payable on November 27, 2015.  Under the amended terms, a total of $125,000 originally available for conversion into a total of 250,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.0005 per share has been amended to reflect a price of $0.005 per share for a total of 25,000,000 shares of common stock, if converted.  

The Company analyzed the above amendment under ASC 470-60 and concluded that the amendment to the conversion terms qualified as a substantial modification and as such the unamortized discount of $88,184 was recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt. The Company recalculated the intrinsic value of the embedded beneficial conversion feature of $125,000 this has been recorded at the discount on the convertible note. The carrying value will be accreted over the term of the convertible debentures up to its face value of total of $125,000.  

During August 2014, the conversion options in these notes became tainted upon the issuance of other variable rate convertible debt. Accordingly, the conversion options in these notes were accounted for as derivative liabilities.

Note 5- Convertible Notes 

On July 16, 2015, the Company amended the terms of the certain convertible loan agreements with four investors for a total of $125,000 due and payable on April 16, 2016. Under the amended terms, a total of $125,000 in convertible notes which come due and payable on November 27, 2015 were first extended to mature on April 16, 2016, and then subsequently extended to mature on January 1, 2017.  In addition, the notes were modified whereby they do not become convertible until maturity.  

The Company analyzed the conversion feature of above Convertible Notes for derivative accounting consideration under FASB ASC 470 and determined that the conversion feature did not create embedded derivatives.  

The Company analyzed the above amendment under ASC 470-60 and concluded that the amendment to the conversion terms qualified as a substantial modification and as such the unamortized discount of $79,103 was recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt. In addition, the fair value of the derivative liabilities associated with the pre modification conversion option in these notes of $591,496 was extinguished resulting in a gain of $591,496. The net gain on extinguishment of liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulting from this substantial modification was $512,393. 

The carrying value of these convertible notes is as follows: 

As at December 31 2015, the carrying values of the convertible debenture and accrued convertible interest thereon were $125,000 and $12,500, respectively. Amortization of the discounts associated with these notes was $37,599 during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

As at September 30, 2016, the carrying values of the convertible debenture and accrued convertible interest thereon were $125,000 and $9,349, respectively. 

On January 13, 2015 the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( SPA ) with Adar Bays, LLC ( Adar ) a Florida Limited Liability company where under the Company has issued two 8% convertible redeemable notes in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000 with the first note being $75,000 and the second note being $75,000, convertible into shares of the Company s common stock with a maturity date one year after issuance or January 13, 2016.  The first of the two notes (the  First Note ) shall be paid for by Adar upon execution of the SPA, and the second note (the  Second Note ) shall initially be paid for by the issuance of an offsetting $75,000 secured note issued to the Company by Adar ( Buyer Note ), provided that prior to conversion of the Second Note, Adar must have paid off the Buyer Note in cash. Under the terms of the First Note, at any time after 180 days, the holder may elect to convert all or part of the face value of the note into shares of the Company s common stock without restrictive legend at a price ( Conversion Price ) for each share of Common Stock equal to 52% of the lowest trading price of the Company s common stock for the twelve prior trading days including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company.   If the shares are not delivered in 3 business days, to the holder,

the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Under the terms of the Second Note, the holder is entitles at its option, after the expiration of the requisite Rule 144 holding period and after full cash payment for the promissory note issued by the holder to the Company simultaneously with the issuance by the Company of this note (the  Holder Issued Note ) to convert all or part of the Note then outstanding into shares of the Company s common stock equal to 52% of the lowest trading price of the Company s common stock for the twelve prior trading days including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company.   If the shares are not delivered in 3 business days, to the holder, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded.  With respect to the First and Second Notes, in the event that the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares the conversion price shall be decreased to 42% instead of 52% while the  Chill  is in effect, and in no event shall the holder be allowed to effect a conversion, if such conversion, along with other shares of the Company common stock beneficially owned by the holder and its affiliates would exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company.  Further, with respect to the Second note, in the event the Company is not  Current  in its SEC filings at the time the note is cash funded, the discount shall be decreased to 40% instead of 52%.  In respect of the First and Second notes interest on any unpaid principal balance of the Notes shall be paid by the Company in common stock (the  Interest Shares ).  The Holder may at any time send a Notice of Conversion for Interest Shares based on the aforementioned formula for all or part of interest payable. 

During the first 180 days the Company may redeem the First Note by paying to the holder an amount as follows: (i) if the redemption is in the first 90 days the note is in effect an amount equal to 125% of the unpaid principal amount of the note along with accrued interest; (ii) if the redemption is after the 91st day the note is in effect then the 

Company may redeem the note in an amount equal to 135% of unpaid principal and interest.  The note is not redeemable after 180 days. 

The Second Note may not be prepaid, except that if the First Note is redeemed by the Company within 6 months of the issuance date of such note, the obligations of the Company under the Second Note will be automatically deemed satisfied and the Second Note and the Holder Note will be deemed canceled and of no further force or effect.  

On January 15, 2015 the Company received net proceeds from Adar totaling $63,750 with respect to the First Note in the total gross amount of $75,000.   Financing fees of $7,500 and legal fees of $3,750 were paid. 

As of December 31, 2015, the principal amount and all accrued interest payable with respect to this convertible note was paid in full with the issuance of 18,902,736 shares of common stock. 

On December 1, 2015, upon receipt of a conversion notice from one of its convertible note holders, the Company issued 2,489,435 shares of common stock to the Note holder.  Subsequent to the fiscal year end the Company advised the note holder of an error in their calculations and it was agreed the Note holder would provide additional cash proceeds of $9,000 in respect of the purchase price of the shares. As a result of the error during fiscal 2015, the Company recorded a loss on debt settlement in the amount of $16,183 in respect to this over issuance of shares.  

On March 8, 2016, the Company received $9,000 from an investor in order to acquire 2,489,435 and recorded as gain on recovered loss on debt settlement for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

On July 13, 2016 a total of $15,000 in principal and $6,030.74 in accrued interest payable to Andara Investments Limited (formerly known as Adam s Ale) was acquired by GW Holdings Group LLC.  The Company issued a replacement note in the principal amount of $21,031 to GW on July 21, 2016 which convertible note bears interest at 8% per annum and is due on July 13, 2017. Interest shall accrue from the advancement date and shall be payable on maturity. Any portion of the loan and unpaid interest are convertible at any time at the option of the lender into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price of a 52% discount to the lowest trading prices for the previous twenty (20) trading days to the date of conversion. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding principal balance under this note was $21,031 (December 31, 2015 - $nil). 

In our evaluation of the financing arrangement, we concluded that the conversion features were not afforded the exemption as a conventional convertible instrument and it did not otherwise meet the conditions set forth in current accounting standards for equity classification. Accordingly, they do not meet the conditions necessary to obtain equity classification and are required to be carried as derivative liabilities. (See footnote 7 for derivative disclosure) 

Additionally, the Company evaluated the convertible notes in note 5 (1) above and concluded that these were tainted due to the variable conversion rate of the above the convertible notes and as such they do not meet the conditions necessary to obtain equity classification and are required to be carried as derivative liabilities. They were removed from the derivative liabilities upon their substantial modification and extinguishment. (See footnote 7 for derivative disclosure) 

The carrying value of certain convertible notes (CN#1, CN#2, CN#3, CN#4, CN#5 and CN#6) are as follows: 

Amortization of the discount over the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $28,013 and $149,598, respectively, which amount has been recorded as interest expense.  The unamortized discount of $61,316 associated with above notes (CN#4, CN#5 and CN#6) will be expensed in future periods.

Derivative liabilities from convertible notes (continued) 

Since equity classification is not available for the conversion feature, we were required to bifurcate the embedded conversion feature and carry it as a derivative liability, at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are carried initially and subsequently at their fair values. 

We estimated the fair value of the derivative on the inception dates, and subsequently, using the Black-Scholes Merton valuation technique, adjusted for the effect of dilution, because that technique embodies all of the assumptions (including, volatility, expected terms, and risk free rates) that are necessary to fair value complex derivate instruments.

Derivative liabilities from share purchase warrants 

On August 22, 2014, the Company entered  into a convertible loan agreement   with an investor which the Company concluded was tainted due to the variable conversion rate of the share purchase warrants (ref Note 6) and as such they did not meet the conditions necessary to obtain equity classification and therefore all convertible notes are required to be carried as derivative liabilities.    

As a result of the application of ASC No. 815 in nine months ended September 30, 2016 the fair value of the conversion feature associated with the convertible loans is summarized as follows: 

The fair value at the commitment and re-measurement dates for the Company s derivative liabilities were based upon the following management assumptions as of September 30, 2016 and commitment date:

The management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). 

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016, along with the accompanying notes.  As used in this quarterly report, the terms "we", "us", "our", and the "Company" means Epoxy, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Couponz, Inc. 

Current Business 

On July 19, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase Couponz, Inc. ( Couponz ), a company incorporated in the State of Nevada.  Under the agreement, the Company had the right to acquire 100% of the ownership of Couponz, Inc. in exchange for the issuance of 24,514,319 shares of preferred stock of the Company and $100,000. The agreement provided for the preferred shares issued to be designated as 1 share of preferred to carry 15 shares of common voting rights and to be convertible into common shares on the basis of 2.5 shares of common for each 1 share of preferred. Mr. David Gasparine, the sole director of Epoxy Inc., is also the controlling shareholder of Couponz, Inc., and, as such, the transaction is considered to be non-arm s length.  Mr. Gasparine became the controlling shareholder of the Company concurrent with the completion of the transaction. 

On November 1, 2013, the Company completed the aforementioned transaction and Couponz, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

Couponz Inc. is the developer of Epoxy app, an application or "app" for iPhone iOS and Android operating systems. Epoxy is an innovative smart phone application designed and created to conveniently connect business owners and consumers in order to ease marketing frustrations. The mobile app gives loyal customers the ease of keeping track of rewards and punch cards all in one place while also giving opportunities to review and share businesses with friends. In turn, Epoxy provides businesses the ability to reward customers, share offers, and deliver information about special events with their customers. Epoxy designers are dedicated to providing a superior and easy-to-use product for business owners to reward loyal customers.

Our goal is to provide a simple and easy to use platform for consumers to find business information, including but not limited to product and service descriptions, promotions, loyalty programs, and customer reviews, as well as to provide business owners a simple and easy to use platform to promote their businesses to mobile app users. Through the use of research and development we will be able to continue evolving our platform and features provided for our users. 

Epoxy, Couponz s mobile app, is a  two-part  system that has a server that both a website and a mobile application access. The mobile app allows users to find local businesses that have an Epoxy membership. An app user can navigate to an individual business several ways. App users can find a specific business by searching for the specific name of the business, the category of the business or by the App users location and listed results on a Map View. App users can then filter the results of the businesses in the Map View by category. Once a business is chosen the app user is presented with a Business Landing Page or  BLP . The BLP displays information about that specific business that the business owner has input including operating hours, locations, menus, phone numbers as well as marketing such as digital loyalty cards and coupons. Within the BLP app users can also create reviews or  Sticky Notes  about that individual business and review other Sticky Notes that have been previously created. When an app user opens a loyalty card or offer the app has a built in scanner that allows the staff to  punch  or  redeem  either offer. A loyalty card is scanned multiple times and once completely filled is valid for a specified offer from the business owner. The app user can collect or  save  filled loyalty cards to redeem at a later time. A coupon is a one-time use offer that once redeemed will disappear from the device and become de-active. A business needs no equipment as the scanner is built into the Epoxy application that is required to scan each unique QR code. Epoxy provides each business with their own unique code that is used to track each loyalty card and offer. Each time an app user redeems an offer or digitally receives a punch the system tracks that information and displays it on a website administration panel for the business owner to track. 

The website serves as a   merchant login where merchants can access an administration panel that allows them to create their BLP and add digital punch cards, offers, events a and send out direct messages to individuals or groups in real-time. The admin panel also will provide the merchants with analytics such as the number of recipients for these direct messages, the number of punch cards and offers that have been used as well as the individual customers who are recommending that particular business (the referral system is a pending patent). This will allow the merchant to distinguish between different levels of consumers and compensate accordingly. This also adds a level of security and accuracy to the loyalty and coupon program that is not practical with a paper system. 

Our pricing for merchants is a simple flat membership fee of $50 a month, without any contracts. The mobile app is free for consumers to download, and is available on both Android and Apple platform. 

We plan to expand geographically in stages.  We have already obtained various customers beyond the Las Vegas market and into certain Southwestern United States. Our initial target for expansion has been focused on Southern California. By December 2017 we plan to expand into the Midwest, and by December 2019 we plan to expand nationally by adding customers with a national presence to our portfolio. As we experience each stage of growth, we plan to increase our staff primarily through commission-based sales people, as opposed to salaried or hourly wage employees, thus minimizing the financial burden of each stage of expansion. We believe that this plan for expansion will also minimize the need for additional outside financing, as we plan to fund our growth primarily through the growth of our paying customer base. In addition, as we move from single customer locations to larger corporate bodies with numerous franchise or store front locations we will adjust the per location pricing of our program to suit our customer s budget and needs.  In addition, we offer training, customized development and product support where applicable for a one time development fee. 

Our primary philosophy is to provide excellent customer service to both app users and merchants, while utilizing feedback through our events, website and mobile app. The mobile application platform gives us an opportunity to seamlessly receive feedback while providing a service. Once feedback has been provided we can then study and then apply this to the system. We believe if you keep the marketing simple, to the point and clean people will be willing to listen and convert. Once a customer is willing to listen, they can be turned into more valuable, loyal customers. 

Couponz s product is marketed to Mobile App Users as well as Business owners.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015. 

Our net (loss) for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

During the comparative three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company experienced a decrease to software development costs and general and administrative expenses as we completed certain major improvements to our app prior to the close of fiscal 2015 and made efforts to reduce our operational overhead while we seek additional customers for our improved software offerings.  During this time the Company has been actively seeking additional capital by way of loans and equity financings in order to meet operational shortfalls.  Management has deferred full salary payments during the current three-month period as the Company secures additional contracts for our services. Interest expenses are reduced period over period as the Company has successfully retired various convertible loans.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

During the comparative nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company experienced a decrease to software development costs and general and administrative expenses as we completed certain major improvements to our app prior to the close of fiscal 2015 and made efforts to reduce our operational overhead while we seek additional customers for our improved software offerings.  In particular, the Company limited consulting fees paid to third parties in the current 9 months ended September 30, 2016 which allowed for a substantive reduction to general and administrative expenses. During this time the Company has been actively seeking additional capital by way of loans and equity financings in order to meet operational shortfalls.  Management has deferred full salary payments during the current three-month period as the Company secures additional contracts for our services. Interest expenses are reduced period over period as the Company has successfully retired various convertible loans.

Liquidity and Financial Condition 

Working Capital 

Cash Flows 

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was $86,364 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared with cash used in operating activities of $306,106 in the same period in 2015. The decrease in cash used in operating activities is predominantly attributable to various non-cash reconciliation adjustments including accretion of debt discount on convertible notes and the change in the fair value of our derivative liabilities, as well as decreases to accounts payable and accrued expenses period over period as we were not able to retire our obligations as they became due. 

Investing Activities 

There were no investing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $83,500 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $385,000 of cash provided in the same period in 2015.

Going Concern 

We do not presently have sufficient funds on hand to operate for the upcoming twelve months.Our cash on hand presently falls short of our currently anticipated operating expenses, however, we believe any shortfall can be addressed by the anticipated increase to our revenues or new loans and equity financing opportunities. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us in the future on satisfactory terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our activities. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. 

Our Company has generated revenues of $20,931 and $25,015 in the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which amounts are not presently sufficient to cover our ongoing quarterly operating expenses. We do expect to conclude certain milestones under existing customer contracts during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to allow us to move certain deferred revenue into our reported income , and to enterin into certain other more lucrative contracts that should provide additional revenue both from software pilot programs and on a monthly basis.  We have never paid dividends and it is unlikely we will generate sufficient earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future to meet our operational overhead. The continuation of our Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability of our Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. As at September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $597,630 and have an accumulated deficit of $3,824,172. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements included herein do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should our Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

During the next twelve months we expect to expend approximately $50,000 for operations of the Company in regard to the filing of reports with the requisite regulatory authorities and $125,000, including costs for advertising and marketing, as required with respect the operations of wholly-owned subsidiary, Couponz, Inc., including salaries, advertising and marketing, and any ongoing software development expenses.  

We may require additional working capital to fund our business objectives.  There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available or accessible on reasonable terms, either by way of an equity financing or debt. If we cannot raise any additional funding we may either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that will have a current or future effect on our financial condition and changes in financial condition. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the Notes to our Financial Statements.  Refer to Note 2 of the Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The new standard will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, with early application permitted. The standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new standard requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020, with early application permitted. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The new guidance will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Under existing accounting guidance, tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies arising from the vesting of share-based payments are recorded in additional paid-in-capital. The new guidance will require such benefits or deficiencies to be recognized as income tax benefits or expenses in the statement of operations.  Companies are required to apply the new guidance prospectively. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires the lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, the Company is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Further, the lease requires a finance lease to recognize both an interest expense and an amortization of the associated expense. Operating leases generally recognize the associated expense on a straight line basis. ASU 2016-02 requires the Company to adopt the standard using a modified retrospective approach and adoption beginning on January 1, 2019. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This new standard provides guidance on how entities measure certain equity investments and present changes in the fair value. This standard requires that entities measure certain equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. 

The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.
