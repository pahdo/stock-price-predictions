1.  
       Nature and continuance of operations    

Eternity
Healthcare Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 24, 2007 under the
name Kid s Book Writer, Inc. On September 23, 2010, the Company changed its name to Eternity Healthcare Inc., and affected
a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding common stock at a factor of 10 old shares for 1 new share. The Company is
focused on offering a range of medical devices and diagnostics.  

On
December 13, 2010, pursuant to the terms of a share exchange agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding
common stock of Eternity Healthcare Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia on December
10, 2009 ( Eternity BC ), for 60,000,000 shares of its own common stock, which were distributed to the shareholders
of Eternity BC (the  Share Exchange Agreement ).  

The
Share Exchange Agreement, which represents a majority of the then issued and outstanding shares of the Company, constituted a
change in control of the Company. The acquisition of Eternity BC was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805-40,  Business Combinations . The Company determined for
accounting and reporting purposes that Eternity BC is the acquirer because of the significant holdings and influence of the control
group of the Company before and after the acquisition. As a result of the transaction, Eternity BC shareholders own approximately
94.4% of issued and outstanding common stock of the Company on a diluted basis.  

On
June 25, 2012, the Company entered into a marketing agreement with Mika Medical Company of Korea to be the sole marketer of a
new line of needle-free injection product for North America. Furthermore, the marketing agreement was extended to some European
countries (German, France, and Spain) in December 2012. Additionally, the Company obtained the rights to market the products throughout
the world with an amendment dated December 20, 2012.  

Since
signing the Distribution Agreement with Mika Medicals, the Company has emerged in organizational and start up activities, including
developing a new business plan, making arrangements for office space and raising additional capital. The Company is generating
revenue from product sales.  

On
June 5, 2014 the Company registered to operate within the state of Arizona with the intention to take over operations within the
United States from the Canadian subsidiary. Beginning January 1, 2016 the Company took over operations within the United States
from the BC Company.  

The
Company has a net loss of $ 219,607 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 (October 31, 2015 - $ 180,201) and has a working
capital deficit of $ 689,726 as at October 31, 2016 (April 30, 2016 - $ 516,213).  

2.  
       Condensed financial statements    

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, result of operations, and
cash flows at October 31, 2016, and for all periods presented herein, have been made.

2.  
       Condensed financial statements  - continued   

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial
statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s April 30, 2016
audited financial statements. The results of operations for the period ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative
of the operating results for the full year.  

3.  
       Going concern    

The
Company s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow
it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on its obtaining adequate
capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be
forced to cease operations.  

4.  
       Significant accounting policies    

The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.  

Basis
of presentation   

  These
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( U.S. GAAP ) and are expressed in U.S. dollars.  

Principles
of consolidation   

  The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Eternity Healthcare Inc.
(BC) and Eternity Healthcare Inc. (Arizona). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Cash
and cash equivalents   

  Cash
and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  

Inventory   

  Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the weighted average cost method.  

Revenue   

  Revenue
is recognized at the point of sale and includes shipping revenue for the delivery to the purchaser. Total revenues do not include
sales taxes as we serve as a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. We recognize retail sales returns
as they occur as historical returns have been negligible. In accordance with SAB 104, revenue is recognized when (i) there is
persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, (iii) the price is fixed
or determinable, and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.

4.  
       Significant accounting policies  - continued   

Foreign
currency translation   

  The
Company s functional currency is the Canadian dollar and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. All transactions initiated
in other currencies are translated into the reporting currency in accordance with ASC 830,  Foreign Currency Matters 
as follows:  

i)    Assets
                                         and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date; and    

ii)    Revenue
                                         and expense items at rate of exchange at the dates on which those elements are recognized.    

Gains
and losses on translation are included in other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders  deficiency for the period.  

Fair
value   

  The
carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and due to related parties approximate their
fair values because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.  

Interest
rate risk   

  The
company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary assets and liabilities.  

Credit
risk   

  Credit
risk is the risk of loss associated with counterparty s inability to fulfill its payment obligations. The Company s
credit risk is primarily attributable to cash and accounting receivable. Management believes that the credit risk concentration
with respect to financial instruments included in cash and accounts receivable is remote.  

Currency
risk   

  The
Company s operating expenses are primarily incurred in Canadian dollars, and fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in relation
to the United States dollar will have an impact upon the profitability of the Company and may also have an effect of the value
of the Company s. The Company has not entered into any agreements or purchased any instruments to hedge possible currency
risk. At October 31, 2016 1 United States dollar was equal to 1.3403 Canadian dollars.  

Basic
and diluted net income (loss) per share   

  The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation
of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by
dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator)
during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury
stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price
for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants.
Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As at October 31, 2016 there were outstanding
stock options totaling 200,000 common shares (Note 9).  

Research
and development   

  The
Company recognizes research and development costs in accordance with ASC 730,  Research and Development , which requires
the Company to expense research and development costs as they are incurred.

4.  
       Significant accounting policies  - continued   

Income
taxes   

  Deferred
income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those
reported for income tax purposes in accordance with ASC 740,  Income Taxes , which requires the use of the asset/liability
method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases,
and for tax losses and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company
provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards when
realization is more likely than not.  

Comprehensive
loss   

  ASC
22,  Comprehensive Income , establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components
in the financial statements. As at October 31, 2016, the Company has items that represent a comprehensive income (loss) and, therefore,
has included a schedule of comprehensive income (loss) in the financial statements.  

Use
of estimates    

  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  

Segments
of an enterprise and related information   

  ASC
280,  Segment Reporting  establishes guidance for the way that public companies report information about operating
segments in annual financial statements and requires reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim financial
statements issued to the public. It also establishes standards for disclosures regarding products and services, geographic areas
and major customers. ASC 280 defines operating segments as components of a company about which separate financial information
is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. The Company has evaluated this Codification and does not believe it is applicable at this time.  

Recently
Enacted Accounting Standards   

  Our
company does not expect the adoption of any other recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial
statements.  

5.  
       Short-term investment    

On
August 18, 2015 the Company invested $600,000 CAD ($ 459,000 USD) in a One Year Cashable Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC)
term deposit. The investment had a one year term that matured on August 18, 2016 and bears interest at a rate of 0.672% per annum.  

On
March 14, 2016 the Company withdrew $200,000 CAD ($ 150,000 USD) from the GIC and received interest of $770 CAD ($ 576 USD). The
remaining $ 400,000 CAD ($ 307,000 USD) continued to earn interest at a rate of 0.672% per annum until its maturity on August
18, 2016. The Company has recognized interest of $ 802 CAD ($ 616 USD) to October 31, 2016. The Company no longer has any short-term
investments as at October 31, 2016.

lives of five years and an average expected volatility of 2.99%. During the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company

 believe,   estimate,   expect,   future,   intend,   plan, 
or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to our company or our company s management identify
forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current view of our company with respect to future events and are subject
to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including the risks contained in the  Risk Factors  section
of our company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, filed with the SEC, relating to our
company s industry, our company s operations and plan of operations, and any businesses that our company may acquire.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results
may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.  

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our company cannot guarantee future
results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws
of the United States, our company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results.  

Our
interim consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ( GAAP ). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe
that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the
time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the interim consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our interim consolidated financial statements would be affected to the
extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a
particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its application. There
are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different
result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere
in this report.  

In
this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars unless otherwise
stated. All references to  common stock  refer to the common shares in our capital stock.  

As
used in this quarterly report, the terms,  we ,  us ,  our  and  our company 
refer to Eternity Healthcare Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiary Eternity Health Care Inc., a Canadian Federal corporation, extra-provincially
registered in British Columbia, unless the context clearly requires or states otherwise.  

General
Overview   

We
were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 24, 2007. On September 23, 2010, we changed our name to Eternity Healthcare
Inc., and we effected a reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock on a 10 old shares for 1 new share basis.  

On
December 13, 2010 we entered into and completed a share exchange agreement with Eternity Healthcare Inc., a Canadian corporation
registered to operate in British Columbia, wherein we acquired Eternity BC as our wholly owned subsidiary and abandoned our former
business to focus on the operations of Eternity BC.  

On
June 5, 2014, we registered to operate within the state of Arizona with the intention to take over operations within the United
States from the Canadian subsidiary. Beginning January 1, 2016, we took over operations within the United States from Eternity
Healthcare, Inc. (BC).  

Our
Current Business   

We
are a medical device company that, subject to government approval, plans to manufacture and market medical devices. Our first
product marketed throughout the world was a needle-free injection system. The products marketed at present and those that we hope
to market in the future differ from other current offerings by allowing ordinary people to perform injection of medication without
the need for professionals.  

On
June 25, 2012, we entered into a marketing agreement to sell a device from Mika Medical Company of South Korea that does not require
a needle for injection of medicine to the body. They provided us with the exclusive rights for this device throughout North America,
Germany, France and Spain and non-exclusive rights for the world market. In 2015, we decided to bring our own needle-free injection
device with superior technology and decided to market both products. We are currently the non-exclusive marketer of the Korean
product.  

Results
of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended October 31, 2016 and 2015   

The
following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements for the quarter ended October 31, 2016 which are included herein.  

Our
operating results for the three and six month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 and the changes between those periods for
the respective items are summarized as follows:  

Our
expenses increased during the three month period ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result
of an increase in general and administrative expenses and salaries which was offset by a decrease in professional fees and research
and development.  

Our
expenses increased during the six month period ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result
of an increase in general and administrative expenses, salaries and professional fees which was offset by an decrease in research
and development.  

Revenues   

We have earned net revenues of $2,733
for the six month period ended October 31, 2016 compared with $31,688 for the six month period ended October 31, 2015. The decrease
in revenue is a result of the Company shifting efforts to develop a product internally versus marketing the current product. We
have incurred $199,785 in operating expenses for the six month period ended October 31, 2016 compared with $176,924 for the six
month period ended October 31, 2015. 

We have earned net revenues of $560
for the three month period ended October 31, 2016 compared with $25,394 for the three month period ended October 31, 2015. The
decrease in revenue is a result of the Company shifting efforts to develop a product internally versus marketing the current product.
We have incurred $105,614 in operating expenses for the three month period ended October 31, 2016 compared with $104,609 for the
three month period ended October 31, 2015. 

Expenses   

Our
expenses for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 are outlined in the table below:  

General and administrative   

General and administrative expenses
have increased during the three and six month period ended October 31, 2016 compared to the three and six month period ended October
31, 2015 as a result of additional expenditure efforts to raise financing. 

Professional
Fees   

Professional fees include accounting
and auditing expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and audit of our financial statements and professional fees that
we pay to our legal counsel. Our accounting and auditing expenses were incurred in connection with the preparation of our audited
financial statements and unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Our legal expenses represent amounts paid to legal
counsel in connection with our corporate organization. Professional fees have decreased during the three month period ended October
31, 2016 compared to the three month period ended October 31, 2015 as a result of a lower level of activity. Professional fees
have increased during the six month period ended October 31, 2016 compared to the six month period ended October 31, 2015 as a
result of timing issues and increased professional expenses in the first quarter of 2016 relating to operations in the United States. 

Research and development   

Research and development costs have
decreased during the three and six month period ended October 31, 2016 compared to the three and six month period ended October
31, 2015 as a result of the Company spending less on product development. 

Liquidity
and Financial Condition   

Working
Capital   

Cash
Flows   

As
of October 31, 2016, our total assets were $380,522 and our total liabilities were $1,070,248 and we had a working capital deficit
of $689,726. Our unaudited financial statements report a net loss of $219,607 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 compared
to a net loss of $180,201 for the same period in 2015.  

Plan
of Operation   

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited financial
statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing. Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. This discussion contains forward-looking
statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in
these forward-looking statements.  

Anticipated
Cash Requirements   

We
have sufficient funds to complete our development and marketing plans. We do not believe that we need to raise any capital to
finance our operation.  

Going
Concern   

The
interim consolidated financial statements accompanying this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies
that our company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
Our company has generated minimal revenues since inception and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or
generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon
the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability of our company to obtain necessary equity financing to achieve
our operating objectives, and the attainment of profitable operations. As of October 31, 2016, our company has an accumulated
deficit of $2,330,429. Our interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should our company be unable
to continue as a going concern.  

Our
interim consolidated financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances related to the uncertainty
of our ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders.
Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  

Future
Financings   

We
anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances
of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional
sales of our equity securities rearrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned activities.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that are material to stockholders.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
interim consolidated financial statements of our company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States. Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation
of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment.  

The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.  

Basis
of presentation   

These
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( U.S. GAAP ) and are expressed in U.S. dollars.  

Principles
of consolidation   

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eternity Healthcare Inc.
(BC). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Cash
and cash equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  

Inventory   

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the weighted average cost method.  

Revenue   

Revenue
is recognized at the point of sale and includes shipping revenue for the delivery to the purchaser. Total revenues do not include
sales taxes as we serve as a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes. We recognize retail sales returns
as they occur as historical returns have been negligible. In accordance with SAB 104, revenue is recognized when (i) there is
persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, (iii) the price is fixed
or determinable, and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.  

Foreign
currency translation   

Our
company s functional currency is the Canadian dollar and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. All transactions initiated
in other currencies are translated into the reporting currency in accordance with ASC 830,  Foreign Currency Matters 
as follows:  

1.  
      Assets
    and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date; and   

2.  
      Revenue
    and expense items at rate of exchange at the dates on which those elements are recognized.   

Gains
and losses on translation are included in other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders  deficiency for the period.  

Fair
value   

The
carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and due to related parties approximate their
fair values because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.  

Interest
rate risk   

We
are not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary assets and liabilities.  

Credit
risk   

Credit
risk is the risk of loss associated with counterparty s inability to fulfill its payment obligations. Our company s
credit risk is primarily attributable to cash and accounting receivable. Management believes that the credit risk concentration
with respect to financial instruments included in cash and accounts receivable is remote.  

Currency
risk   

Our
company s operating expenses are primarily incurred in Canadian dollars, and fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in relation
to the United States dollar will have an impact upon the profitability of our company and may also have an effect of the value
of our company s. Our company has not entered into any agreements or purchased any instruments to hedge possible currency
risk. At October 31, 2016, 1 United States dollar was equal to 1.3041 Canadian dollars.  

Basic
and diluted net income (loss) per share   

Our
company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation
of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by
dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator)
during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury
stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price
for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants.
Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As at October 31, 2016 there were outstanding
stock options totaling 200,000 common shares.  

Research
and development   

Our
company recognizes research and development costs in accordance with ASC 730,  Research and Development , which requires
our company to expense research and development costs as they are incurred.  

Income
taxes   

Deferred
income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those
reported for income tax purposes in accordance with ASC 740,  Income Taxes , which requires the use of the asset/liability
method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases,
and for tax losses and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Our company
provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards when
realization is more likely than not.  

Comprehensive
loss   

ASC
22,  Comprehensive Income , establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components
in the financial statements. As at October 31, 2016, our company has items that represent a comprehensive income (loss) and, therefore,
has included a schedule of comprehensive income (loss) in the financial statements.  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  

Segments
of an enterprise and related information   

ASC
280,  Segment Reporting  establishes guidance for the way that public companies report information about operating
segments in annual financial statements and requires reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim financial
statements issued to the public. It also establishes standards for disclosures regarding products and services, geographic areas
and major customers. ASC 280 defines operating segments as components of a company about which separate financial information
is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. Our company has evaluated this Codification and does not believe it is applicable at this time.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Our
company does not expect the adoption of any other recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial
statements.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

As
a  small reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Management s
Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our principal executive
officer, principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

As
of the end of our quarter covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principle
accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the
foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer
and principle accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the
period covered by this quarterly report due to the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting identified
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 21, 2016.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

During
the period covered by this report there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

   Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

We
know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material
proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered
beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.

                                         the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others
