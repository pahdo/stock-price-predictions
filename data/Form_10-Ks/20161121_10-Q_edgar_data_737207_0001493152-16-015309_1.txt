1   Business, Liquidity and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Business    

Marina
Biotech, Inc. ( we ,  Marina, or the  Company ) is a biotechnology company that has focused on the
discovery, development and commercialization of nucleic acid-based therapies to treat orphan diseases. Our pipeline includes CEQ508,
a product in clinical development for the treatment of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis ( FAP ), for which we have received
Orphan Drug Designation ( ODD ) and Fast Track Designation ( FTD ) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
( FDA ), and preclinical programs for the treatment of type 1 myotonic dystrophy ( DM1 ) and Duchenne
muscular dystrophy ( DMD ).  

Since
2010, we have strategically acquired/in-licensed and further developed nucleic acid chemistry and delivery-related technologies
in order to establish a novel and differentiated drug discovery platform. This platform allows us to distinguish ourselves from
others in the nucleic acid therapeutics area in that we are the only company capable of creating a wide variety of therapeutics
targeting coding and non-coding RNA via multiple mechanisms of action such as RNA interference ( RNAi ), messenger
RNA translational inhibition, exon skipping, microRNA ( miRNA ) replacement, miRNA inhibition, and steric blocking
in order to modulate gene expression either up or down depending on the specific mechanism of action. Our goal has been to dramatically
improve the lives of the patients and families affected by orphan diseases through either our own efforts or those of our collaborators
and licensees.  

Merger
with IthenaPharma    

On
November 15, 2016, we entered into, and consummated the transactions contemplated by, an Agreement and Plan of Merger between
and among our company, IthenaPharma Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Ithena ), Ithena Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Marina ( Merger Sub ), and Vuong Trieu as the Ithena representative (the
 Merger Agreement ), pursuant to which Ithena merged into Merger Sub (the  Merger ). Upon completion of
the Merger and subject to the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub has ceased to exist and Ithena continues
as the surviving corporation of the Merger and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marina. As consideration for the Merger, the Company
issued to the former shareholders of Ithena 58,392,828 shares of the Company s common stock, representing approximately
65% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock following the completion of the Merger. In addition,
the Company assumed warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of Ithena common stock, appointed Vuong Trieu, the president of Ithena,
as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company and gave the right to appoint one additional member of the Board of Director
to the former shareholders of Ithena.  

In
the Merger, Marina acquired the business and assets of Ithena, which consist primarily of pharmaceutical compounds in various
stages of development. In addition, Vuong Trieu, the Chief Executive Officer of Ithena, extended to the Company a $540,000 demand
line of credit, of which $15,000 had been drawn at November 18, 2016.  

Moreover,
we entered into a License Agreement with Autotelic LLC, a stockholder of Ithena, pursuant to which (A) we will license to Autotelic
LLC certain patent rights, data and know-how relating to Familial Adenomatous Polyposis and nasal insulin, for human therapeutics
other than for oncology-related therapies and indications, and (B) Autotelic LLC licensed to us certain patent rights, data and
know-how relating to IT-102 and IT-103, in connection with individualized therapy of pain using a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug and an anti-hypertensive without inducing intolerable edema, and treatment of certain aspects of proliferative disease, but
not including rights to IT-102/IT-103 for TDM guided dosing for all indications using an Autotelic TDM Device. We also granted
a right of first refusal to Autotelic LLC with respect to any license by us of the rights licensed by or to us under the License
Agreement in any cancer indication outside of gastrointestinal cancers.  

Further,
we entered into a Master Services Agreement with Autotelic Inc., a stockholder of Ithena, pursuant to which Autotelic Inc. agreed
to provide certain business functions and services from time to time during regular business hours at our request.  

As
the former shareholders of Ithena will control greater than 50% of the Company subsequent to the Merger, it is anticipated that
Ithena will be considered the acquirer for accounting purposes and that future financial disclosures for the Company will be the
historical information of Ithena. Ithena will account for the acquisition of the Company under the purchase accounting method
following completion.  

We
will need additional capital to execute our business, which may involve acquiring other assets or selling existing assets. If
we are not successful in raising additional capital, strategic alternatives will be considered, which may include delaying the
development of certain compounds, selling (or otherwise losing our rights to) existing technology or ceasing operations.  

For
further information regarding the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other documents and transactions contemplated thereby,
see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 18, 2016.  

Recent
Licensing and IP Developments    

In
February 2016, we entered into an evaluation and option agreement covering certain of our platforms for the delivery of an undisclosed
genome editing technology. The agreement contains an option provision for the exclusive license of our SMARTICLES platform in
a specific gene editing field.  

In
March 2016, we entered into a license agreement covering certain of our platforms for the delivery of an undisclosed genome editing
technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront license fee of $0.25 million, and could receive up to $40
million in success-based milestones.  

In
July 2016, we entered into a license agreement with an undisclosed licensee that grants such licensee rights to use our technology
and intellectual property to develop and commercialize products combining certain molecules with our liposomal delivery technology
known as NOV582. Under the terms of this agreement, the licensee agreed to pay to us an upfront license fee in the amount of $0.35
million (to be paid in installments through the end of 2017), along with milestone payments on a per-licensed-product basis and
royalty payments in the low single digit percentages. As of September 30, 2016, we have received $0.05 million per the terms of
this license agreement. In conjunction with this transaction, we pledged to issue common stock valued at $0.002 million to Novosom.
This obligation is included in Fair Value of Stock to be Issued to Settle Liabilities at September 30, 2016.  

We
believe that, as a result of the issuance of US patent no. 9,023,793 on May 5, 2015, we became entitled to receive a milestone
payment in the amount of $2 million under an Asset Purchase Agreement dated August 25, 2010 between us and Cypress Biosciences
( Cypress ), which was subsequently assigned by Cypress to Kyalin Biosciences, Inc., and further assigned to Retrophin,
Inc. ( Retrophin ). We have advised Retrophin of our claim to payment of this milestone. However, Retrophin has denied
our claim. Although we intend to vigorously pursue our right to receive the milestone payment, there can be no assurance that
we will be successful in our endeavors to receive the payments to which we believe we are entitled.  

Note
Purchase Agreement    

On
June 20, 2016, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with certain investors (the  Purchasers ),
pursuant to which we issued to the Purchasers unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $0.3 million (the
 Notes ). Interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Notes at the rate of 12% per annum beginning
on September 20, 2016. The Notes will become due and payable on June 20, 2017, provided, that, upon the closing of a financing
transaction that occurs while the Notes are outstanding, each Purchaser shall have the right to either: (i) accelerate the maturity
date of the Note held by such Purchaser or (ii) convert the entire outstanding principal balance under the Note held by such Purchaser
and accrued interest thereon into our securities that are issued and sold at the closing of such financing transaction.  

Further,
if we at any time while the Notes are outstanding receive any cash payments in the aggregate amount of not less than $0.25 million,
as a result of the licensing, partnering or disposition of any of the technology held by us or any related product or asset, we
shall pay to the holders of the Notes, on a pro rata basis, an amount equal to 25% of each payment actually received by us, which
payments shall be applied against the outstanding principal balance of the Notes and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
until such time as the Notes are repaid in full.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the accrued interest expense on the Notes amounted to $0.007.  

In
the Purchase Agreement, we agreed: (x) to extend the termination date of all of the warrants to purchase shares of our common
stock (such warrants, the  Prior Warrants ) that were delivered to the purchasers pursuant to that certain Note and
Warrant Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 10, 2012 between us and the purchasers identified on the signature pages thereto,
as it has been amended to date, to February 10, 2020 and (y) to extend the exercise price protection afforded of the Prior Warrants
so that such protection would apply to any financing transaction effected by us on or prior to June 19, 2017 (with any such adjustment
only applying to 80% of the Prior Warrants, ad with such protection not resulting in the issuance of any additional shares of
our common stock). As the Prior Warrants were already recorded at fair value as a result of price adjustable terms, the impacts
of the modification of the terms is included in the change in fair value of price adjustable warrants in the statement of operations.  

Liquidity    

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. At September 30,
2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $334.1 million, $108.3 million of which has been accumulated since we focused
on RNA therapeutics in June 2008. To the extent that sufficient funding is available, we will continue to incur operating losses
as we execute our plan to raise additional funds and investigate strategic and business development initiatives. In addition,
we have had and will continue to have negative cash flows from operations. We have funded our losses primarily through the sale
of common and preferred stock and warrants, the sale of the Notes, revenue provided from our license agreements and, to a lesser
extent, equipment financing facilities and secured loans. In 2015 and 2016, we funded operations with a combination of the issuance
of the Notes, preferred stock and license-related revenues. At September 30, 2016, we had negative working capital of $2.8 million
and $0.1 million in cash. Our limited operating activities consume the majority of our cash resources.  

We
believe that our current cash resources, including the proceeds from the Notes received in June 2016 as noted above, and the $0.54
million line of credit associated with the Merger Agreement, will enable us to fund our intended operations through March 2017.
Our ability to execute our operating plan beyond March 2017 depends on our ability to obtain additional funding. The volatility
in our stock price, as well as market conditions in general, could make it difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms,
or at all. If we fail to obtain additional capital when required, we may have to modify, delay or abandon some or all of our planned
activities, or terminate our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such endeavors. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Basis
of Preparation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     

Basis
of Preparation    The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and in accordance with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and note
disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete financial statements.
The accompanying unaudited financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements,
including the notes thereto, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
with the SEC. The information furnished in this report reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments),
which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and
cash flows for each period presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future period.  

Use
of Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Estimates having relatively higher significance include revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, valuation of warrants,
valuation and estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of features embedded
within note agreements and amendments, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Reclassifications
   Certain amounts have been reclassified in prior period condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to the
current year presentation.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    We consider the fair value of cash, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and promissory
notes to not be materially different from their carrying value. These financial instruments have short-term maturities.  

We
follow authoritative guidance with respect to fair value reporting issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
for financial assets and liabilities, which defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain
disclosures. The guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. The guidance discusses valuation techniques,
such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and
the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following
is a brief description of those three levels:  

Level
1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active.  

Level
3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed
by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.  

Our
cash is subject to fair value measurement and value is determined by Level 1 inputs. We measure the liability for committed stock
issuances with a fixed share number using Level 1 inputs. We measure the liability for price adjustable warrants and certain features
embedded in notes using the Black-Scholes option pricing model ( Black-Scholes ) under various probability weighted
scenarios, using Level 3 inputs. The following tables summarize our liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as
of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016:

The
following presents activity of the fair value liability of price adjustable warrants determined by Level 3 inputs for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, including the impact of the modifications to the Prior Warrants made in conjunction with the
Purchase Agreement:  

Net
Income (Loss) per Common Share    Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss)
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share includes the
effect of common stock equivalents (stock options, unvested restricted stock and warrants) when, under either the treasury or
if-converted method, such inclusion in the computation would be dilutive. The following number of shares have been excluded from
diluted net income (loss) since such inclusion would be anti-dilutive:  

The
following is a reconciliation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:  

Impairment
of long-lived assets    We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and perform
detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present. In addition, we perform detailed impairment testing for indefinite-lived
intangible assets, specifically IPR D, at least annually at December 31. When necessary, we record charges for impairments.
Specifically:  

For
    finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property and
    equipment, we compare the undiscounted amount of the projected cash flows associated with the asset, or asset group, to the
    carrying amount. If the carrying amount is found to be greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value
    over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets
    and modify them, as appropriate; and   

For
    indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as IPR D assets, each year and whenever impairment indicators are present, we
    determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value, if any.   

Note
2   Stockholders  Equity    

Preferred
Stock    Our board of directors has the authority, without action by the stockholders, to designate and issue up to 100,000
shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each series, any or
all of which may be greater than the rights of our common stock. We have designated 1,000 shares as Series B Preferred Stock ( Series
B Preferred ) and 90,000 shares as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock ( Series A Preferred ). No
shares of Series B Preferred or Series A Preferred are outstanding. In March 2014, we designated 1,200 shares as Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock ( Series C Preferred ). In August 2015, we designated 220 shares as Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock ( Series D Preferred ).  

In
August 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain investors pursuant to which we sold 220 shares of Series
D Preferred, and warrants to purchase up to 3.44 million shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $0.40 per
share before August 2021, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.1 million. We incurred $0.01 million of stock issuance costs in
conjunction with the Series D Preferred, which were netted against the proceeds. The warrants issued in connection with Series
D Preferred contain an exercise price protection provision whereby the exercise price per share to purchase common stock covered
by these warrants is subject to reduction in the event of certain dilutive stock issuances at any time within two years of the
issuance date, but not to be reduced below $0.28 per share. Any such adjustment will not result in the issuance of any additional
shares of our common stock. Each share of Series D Preferred has a stated value of $5,000 per share and is convertible into shares
of common stock at a conversion price of $0.40 per share. The Series D Preferred is initially convertible into an aggregate of
2,750,000 shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and adjustments, has a 5% stated dividend rate, is not redeemable
and has voting rights on an as-converted basis.  

To
account for the issuance of the Series D Preferred and warrants, we first assessed the terms of the warrants and determined that,
due to the exercise price protection provision, they should be recorded as derivative liabilities. We determined the fair value
of the warrants on the issuance date and recorded a liability and a discount of $0.6 million on the Series D Preferred resulting
from the allocation of proceeds to the warrants. We then determined the effective conversion price of the Series D Preferred which
resulted in a beneficial conversion feature of $0.7 million. The beneficial conversion feature was recorded as both a debit and
a credit to additional paid-in capital and as a deemed dividend on the Series D Preferred in determining net income applicable
to common stock holders in the consolidated statements of operations.  

Each
share of Series C Preferred has a stated value of $5,000 per share and is convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion
price of $0.75 per share. In June 2015, an investor converted 90 shares of Series C Preferred into 0.6 million shares of common
stock. In November 2015, an investor converted an additional 90 shares of Series C Preferred into 0.6 million shares of common
stock. Also in November 2015, an investor converted 50 shares of Series D Preferred into 0.6 million shares of common stock.  

In
February 2016, an investor converted 110 shares of Series D Preferred into 1.4 million shares of common stock.  

Common
Stock   Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to
a vote of the holders of our common stock. Subject to the rights of the holders of any class of our capital stock having any preference
or priority over our common stock, the holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends that are declared by our
board of directors out of legally available funds. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of
common stock are entitled to share ratably in our net assets remaining after payment of liabilities, subject to prior rights of
preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. Our common stock has no preemptive rights, conversion rights, redemption rights or
sinking fund provisions, and there are no dividends in arrears or default. All shares of our common stock have equal distribution,
liquidation and voting rights, and have no preferences or exchange rights. Our common stock currently trades on the OTCQB tier
of the OTC Markets.  

In
February 2016, we issued 0.21 million shares with a value of $0.06 million to Novosom as the equity component owed under our December
2015 milestone payment from MiNA Therapeutics. In April 2016, we issued 0.47 million shares with a value of $0.075 million to
Novosom as the equity component owed under a March 2016 license agreement covering certain of our platforms for the delivery of
an undisclosed genome editing technology.  

In
July 2016, we pledged to issue common stock valued at $0.015 million to Novosom for the portion due under our July 2010 Asset
Purchase Agreement with Novosom, related to our license agreement with an undisclosed licensee that grants such licensee rights
to use our technology and intellectual property to develop and commercialize products combining certain molecules with our liposomal
delivery technology known as NOV582. As of September 30, 2016, the pledge was issued as a dollar denominated liability and was
not influenced by changes in stock price. This obligation is included in Fair Value of Stock to be Issued to Settle Liabilities
at September 30, 2016. In November 2016, we issued 0.12 million shares with a value of $0.015 million to Novosom as the equity
component owed under our July 2016 license agreement  

In
November 2016, we issued 1,500,000 shares of common stock to Novosom in connection with a letter agreement that we entered into
with Novosom on November 15, 2016 relating to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of July 27, 2010 between and among
our company, Novosom and Steffen Panzner, Ph.D.  

Warrants
  As noted above, in the Purchase Agreement, we agreed: (x) to extend the termination date of all of the Prior Warrants
to February 10, 2020 and (y) to extend the exercise price protection afforded of the Prior Warrants so that such protection would
apply to any financing transaction effected by us on or prior to June 19, 2017 (with any such adjustment only applying to 80%
of the Prior Warrants, and with such protection not resulting in the issuance of any additional shares of our common stock). In
conjunction with this modification, the fair value of the derivative warrant liability associated with the 20% of the Prior Warrants
that no longer have the anti-dilution protection equal to $0.09 million was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.  

In
connection with the Merger, and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, we assumed warrants to purchase
up to 300,000 shares of Ithena common stock, which warrants were converted into warrants representing the right to purchase up
to 3,153,211 shares of our common stock. The number of shares underlying the assumed warrants and the
exercise price thereof was adjusted by the exchange ratio used in the Merger (10.510708), with any fractional shares
rounded down to the next lowest number of whole shares.  

As
of September 30, 2016, there were 24,466,783 warrants outstanding, with a weighted average exercise price of $0.47 per share,
and annual expirations as follows:  

Note
3   Stock Incentive Plans   

Stock-based
Compensation . Certain option and share awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control as defined in
the applicable plan and certain employment agreements. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense:  

Stock
Options    Stock option activity was as follows:  

The
following table summarizes additional information on our stock options outstanding at September 30, 2016:  

In
January 2016, we issued options to purchase up to an aggregate of 0.152 million shares of our common stock to non-employee members
of our board of directors at an exercise price of $0.26 per share as the annual grant to such directors for their service on our
board of directors during 2016, and we issued options to purchase up to an aggregate of 0.08 million shares of our common stock
to the members of our scientific advisory board at an exercise price of $0.26 per share as the annual grant to such persons for
their service on our scientific advisory board during 2016.  

At
September 30, 2016, we had $0.06 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options. We expect
to recognize this cost over a weighted average period of 0.25 years.  

At
September 30, 2016, the intrinsic value of options outstanding or exercisable was zero as there were no options outstanding with
an exercise price less than $0.13, the per share closing market price of our common stock at that date.  

Our
Chief Executive Officer resigned from our company effective June 10, 2016, ceasing all work for our company at such time. On July
22, 2016, we entered into an agreement with our former CEO, pursuant to which we agreed (x) to pay $0.07 million of back wages
at such time as funds become reasonably available, all of which wages have been accrued as of June 30, 2016, and (y) that all
remaining unvested options to purchase shares of our common stock would vest immediately, with the exercise period of such options
(as well as such options held by our former CEO that had already vested as of June 10, 2016) extended through the earlier of the
option s exercise period or December 31, 2017. We recognized the remaining compensation expense of $0.3 million associated
with these unvested 321,250 options, including the incremental cost resulting from modification of such options grant to extend
their exercise period, in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, upon the modification.  

In
connection with and subject to the completion of the Merger, we granted to each of the current members of our Board of Directors
options to purchase up to 35,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share. The options will be exercisable
for the five-year period beginning on the date of grant.  

Note
4   Intellectual Property and Collaborative Agreements   

In
July 2010, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we acquired intellectual property for Novosom s SMARTICLES-based
liposomal delivery system. In February 2016, we issued Novosom 0.21 million shares of common stock valued at $0.06 million for
amounts due and included in Fair Value of Stock to be Issued to Settle Liabilities at December 31, 2015.  

In
March 2016, we entered into a license agreement covering certain of our platforms for the delivery of an undisclosed genome editing
technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront license fee of $0.25 million and could receive up to $40
million in success-based milestones. In April 2016, we issued Novosom 0.47 million shares of common stock valued at $0.075 million
for amounts due under this agreement.  

In
July 2016, we entered into a license agreement with an undisclosed licensee that grants such licensee rights to use our technology
and intellectual property to develop and commercialize products combining certain molecules with our liposomal delivery technology
known as NOV582. Under the terms of this agreement, the licensee agreed to pay to us an upfront license fee in the amount of $0.35
million (to be paid in installments through the end of 2017), along with milestone payments on a per-licensed-product basis and
royalty payments in the low single digit percentages. As of September 30, 2016, we have received $0.05 million per the terms of
this license agreement. In conjunction with this transaction, we pledged to issue common stock valued at $0.015 million to Novosom.
This obligation is included in Fair Value of Stock to be Issued to Settle Liabilities at September 30, 2016. In November 2016,
we issued 0.12 million shares with a value of $0.015 million to Novosom as the equity component owed under our July 2016 license
agreement.  

Note
5   Commitments and Contingencies    

Contingencies
  We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Our management
currently believes that resolution of such legal matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM
2   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     

Overview

Statements
contained herein that are not historical fact may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange
Act, that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. There are a number of important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement made by us. These factors include,
but are not limited to: (i) the ability of our company to obtain additional and substantial funding in the near term; (ii) our
ability to successfully complete the Merger and integrate the business of Ithena; (iii) the ability of our company to attract
and/or maintain research, development, commercialization and manufacturing partners; (iv) the ability of our company and/or a
partner to successfully complete product research and development, including pre-clinical and clinical studies and commercialization;
(v) the ability of our company and/or a partner to obtain required governmental approvals, including product and patent approvals;
and (vi) the ability of our company and/or a partner to develop and commercialize products that can compete favorably with those
of competitors. In addition, significant fluctuations in quarterly results may occur as a result of the timing of milestone payments,
the recognition of revenue from milestone payments and other sources, and the timing of costs and expenses related to our research
and development programs. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or suggested
in any forward-looking statements are contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those factors
discussed under the captions  Risk Factors  and  Forward-Looking Statements  in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as may be supplemented or amended from time to time, which we urge investors
to consider. We undertake no obligation to publicly release revisions in such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect
events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrences of unanticipated events or circumstances, except as
otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.   

Business    

We
are a biotechnology company that has focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of nucleic acid-based therapies
to treat orphan diseases. Our pipeline includes CEQ508, a product in clinical development for the treatment of Familial Adenomatous
Polyposis ( FAP ), for which we have received Orphan Drug Designation ( ODD ) and Fast Track Designation
( FTD ) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), and preclinical programs for the treatment
of type 1 myotonic dystrophy ( DM1 ) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ).  

Since
2010, we have strategically acquired/in-licensed and further developed nucleic acid chemistry and delivery-related technologies
in order to establish a novel and differentiated drug discovery platform. This platform allows us to distinguish ourselves from
others in the nucleic acid therapeutics area in that we are the only company capable of creating a wide variety of therapeutics
targeting coding and non-coding RNA via multiple mechanisms of action such as RNA interference ( RNAi ), messenger
RNA translational inhibition, exon skipping, microRNA ( miRNA ) replacement, miRNA inhibition, and steric blocking
in order to modulate gene expression either up or down depending on the specific mechanism of action. Our goal has been to dramatically
improve the lives of the patients and families affected by orphan diseases through either our own efforts or those of our collaborators
and licensees.  

Merger
with IthenaPharma    

On
November 15, 2016, we entered into, and consummated the transactions contemplated by, an Agreement and Plan of Merger between
and among our company, IthenaPharma Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Ithena ), Ithena Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Marina ( Merger Sub ), and Vuong Trieu as the Ithena representative (the
 Merger Agreement ), pursuant to which Ithena merged into Merger Sub (the  Merger ). Upon completion of
the Merger and subject to the applicable provisions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub has ceased to exist and Ithena continues
as the surviving corporation of the Merger and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marina. As consideration for the Merger, the Company
issued to the former shareholders of Ithena 58,392,828 shares of the Company s common stock, representing approximately
65% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock following the completion of the Merger. In addition,
the Company assumed warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of Ithena common stock, appointed Vuong Trieu, the president of Ithena,
as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company and gave the right to appoint one additional member of the Board of Director
to the former shareholders of Ithena.  

In
the Merger, Marina acquired the business and assets of Ithena, which consist primarily of pharmaceutical compounds in various
stages of development. In addition, Vuong Trieu, the Chief Executive Officer of Ithena, extended to the Company a $540,000 demand
line of credit, of which $15,000 had been drawn at November 18, 2016.  

Moreover,
we entered into a License Agreement with Autotelic LLC, a stockholder of Ithena, pursuant to which (A) we will license to Autotelic
LLC certain patent rights, data and know-how relating to Familial Adenomatous Polyposis and nasal insulin, for human therapeutics
other than for oncology-related therapies and indications, and (B) Autotelic LLC licensed to us certain patent rights, data and
know-how relating to IT-102 and IT-103, in connection with individualized therapy of pain using a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug and an anti-hypertensive without inducing intolerable edema, and treatment of certain aspects of proliferative disease, but
not including rights to IT-102/IT-103 for TDM guided dosing for all indications using an Autotelic TDM Device. We also granted
a right of first refusal to Autotelic LLC with respect to any license by us of the rights licensed by or to us under the License
Agreement in any cancer indication outside of gastrointestinal cancers.  

Further,
we entered into a Master Services Agreement with Autotelic Inc., a stockholder of Ithena, pursuant to which Autotelic Inc. agreed
to provide certain business functions and services from time to time during regular business hours at our request.  

As
the former shareholders of Ithena will control greater than 50% of the Company subsequent to the Merger, it is anticipated that
Ithena will be considered the acquirer for accounting purposes and that future financial disclosures for the Company will be the
historical information of Ithena. Ithena will account for the acquisition of the Company under the purchase accounting method
following completion.  

We
will need additional capital to execute our business, which may involve acquiring other assets or selling existing assets. If
we are not successful in raising additional capital, strategic alternatives will be considered, which may include delaying the
development of certain compounds, selling (or otherwise losing our rights to) existing technology or ceasing operations.  

For
further information regarding the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other documents and transactions contemplated thereby,
see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 18, 2016.  

Recent
Licensing and IP Developments    

In
February 2016, we entered into an evaluation and option agreement covering certain of our platforms for the delivery of an undisclosed
genome editing technology. The agreement contains an option provision for the exclusive license of our SMARTICLES platform in
a specific gene editing field.  

In
March 2016, we entered into a license agreement covering certain of our platforms for the delivery of an undisclosed genome editing
technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront license fee of $0.25 million, and could receive up to $40
million in success-based milestones.  

In
July 2016, we entered into a license agreement with an undisclosed licensee that grants such licensee rights to use our technology
and intellectual property to develop and commercialize products combining certain molecules with our liposomal delivery technology
known as NOV582. Under the terms of this agreement, the licensee agreed to pay to us an upfront license fee in the amount of $0.35
million (to be paid in installments through the end of 2017), along with milestone payments on a per-licensed-product basis and
royalty payments in the low single digit percentages. As of September 30, 2016, we have received $0.05 million per the terms of
this license agreement. In conjunction with this transaction, we pledged to issue common stock valued at $0.015 million to Novosom.
This obligation is included in Fair Value of Stock to be Issued to Settle Liabilities at September 30, 2016. In November 2016,
we issued 0.12 million shares with a value of $0.015 million to Novosom as the equity component owed under our July 2016 license
agreement.  

We
believe that, as a result of the issuance of US patent no. 9,023,793 on May 5, 2015, we became entitled to receive a milestone
payment in the amount of $2 million under an Asset Purchase Agreement dated August 25, 2010 between us and Cypress Biosciences
( Cypress ), which was subsequently assigned by Cypress to Kyalin Biosciences, Inc., and further assigned to Retrophin,
Inc. ( Retrophin ). We have advised Retrophin of our claim to payment of this milestone. However, Retrophin has denied
our claim. Although we intend to vigorously pursue our right to receive the milestone payment, there can be no assurance that
we will be successful in our endeavors to receive the payments to which we believe we are entitled.  

Note
Purchase Agreement    

On
June 20, 2016, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with certain investors (the  Purchasers ),
pursuant to which we issued to the Purchasers unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $0.3 million (the
 Notes ). Interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Notes at the rate of 12% per annum beginning
on September 20, 2016. The Notes will become due and payable on June 20, 2017, provided, that, upon the closing of a financing
transaction that occurs while the Notes are outstanding, each Purchaser shall have the right to either: (i) accelerate the maturity
date of the Note held by such Purchaser or (ii) convert the entire outstanding principal balance under the Note held by such Purchaser
and accrued interest thereon into our securities that are issued and sold at the closing of such financing transaction.  

Further,
if we at any time while the Notes are outstanding receive any cash payments in the aggregate amount of not less than $0.25 million,
as a result of the licensing, partnering or disposition of any of the technology held by us or any related product or asset, we
shall pay to the holders of the Notes, on a pro rata basis, an amount equal to 25% of each payment actually received by us, which
payments shall be applied against the outstanding principal balance of the Notes and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
until such time as the Notes are repaid in full.  

In
the Purchase Agreement, we agreed: (x) to extend the termination date of all of the warrants to purchase shares of our common
stock (such warrants, the  Prior Warrants ) that were delivered to the purchasers pursuant to that certain Note and
Warrant Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 10, 2012 between us and the purchasers identified on the signature pages thereto,
as it has been amended to date, to February 10, 2020 and (y) to extend the exercise price protection afforded of the Prior Warrants
so that such protection would apply to any financing transaction effected by us on or prior to June 19, 2017 (with any such adjustment
only applying to 80% of the Prior Warrants, ad with such protection not resulting in the issuance of any additional shares of
our common stock). As the Prior Warrants were already recorded at fair value as a result of price adjustable terms, the impacts
of the modification of the terms is included in the change in fair value of price adjustable warrants in the statement of operations.  

Liquidity    

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. At September 30,
2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $334.1 million, $108.3 million of which has been accumulated since we focused
on RNA therapeutics in June 2008. To the extent that sufficient funding is available, we will continue to incur operating losses
as we execute our plan to raise additional funds and investigate strategic and business development initiatives. In addition,
we have had and will continue to have negative cash flows from operations. We have funded our losses primarily through the sale
of common and preferred stock and warrants, the sale of the Notes, revenue provided from our license agreements and, to a lesser
extent, equipment financing facilities and secured loans. In 2015 and 2016, we funded operations with a combination of the issuance
of the Notes, preferred stock and license-related revenues. At September 30, 2016, we had negative working capital of $2.8 million
and $0.1 million in cash. Our limited operating activities consume the majority of our cash resources.  

We
believe that our current cash resources, including the proceeds from the Notes received in June 2016 as noted above, and the $0.54
million line of credit associated with the Merger Agreement, will enable us to fund our intended operations through March 2017.
Our ability to execute our operating plan beyond March 2017 depends on our ability to obtain additional funding. The volatility
in our stock price, as well as market conditions in general, could make it difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms,
or at all. If we fail to obtain additional capital when required, we may have to modify, delay or abandon some or all of our planned
activities, or terminate our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such endeavors. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Cash
flows     

Our
operating activities used cash of $0.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.6 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in operating activities related primarily
to funding our operating loss, adjusted for non-cash items. Adjustments for non-cash items, totaling $1.7 million, represented
the change in fair value of price adjustable warrants, partially offset by stock compensation charges. Changes in operating assets
and liabilities provided $0.4 million from the deferred payments to vendors, partially offset by the reduction of certain accrued
liabilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in operating activities related primarily to funding our
operating loss, adjusted for non-cash items. Adjustments for non-cash items, totaling $5.6 million, represented stock compensation,
gain on settled liabilities, license expense and the change in fair value of price adjustable warrants.  

Changes
in operating assets and liabilities provided $1.2 million from collecting $0.5 million due under a licensing agreement, and $0.7
million driven mainly by changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with costs incurred related to SEC filings
in preparation for financing activities.  

We
had no investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  

We
received $0.3 million from the Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an immaterial amount of proceeds
from warrant exercises in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash provided by financing activities in 2015 are primarily
due to the sale of our Series D preferred shares and warrants to purchase common stock.  

Consolidated
Results of Operations     

Comparison
of Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015     

Revenue.
 We recorded $0.05 million in revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2016, and $0.3 million in revenue in the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, which consisted of upfront license fees from two license agreements covering certain platforms
for the delivery of an undisclosed genome editing technology. The majority of our licensing deals provide for clinical and regulatory
milestones, so significant revenues could result from the existing licenses, but are uncertain as to timing or probability. We
will seek R D collaborations as well as licensing transactions to fund business operations.  

We
recorded $0.08 million and $0.5 million in revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, which
consisted of an accelerated milestone payment from Mirna under our 2011 licensing agreement.  

Research
and Development.  Research   development ( R D ) expense consists primarily of costs of sublicensing fees,
clinical development and pre-clinical studies, consulting and other outside services, and other costs. R D expense decreased
$0.088 million from $0.09 million, and $0.35 million from $0.57 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015,
respectively, to $0.002 million and $0.22 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, primarily
due to the elimination of most consulting and clinical studies, offset partially by a slight increase in the sublicensing fees
payable to Novosom from the above mentioned technology license and milestone payment.  

General
and administrative.  General and administrative ( G A ) expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related
expenses to support our R D activities, stock-based compensation for G A personnel and non-employee members of our Board,
professional fees, such as accounting and legal, and corporate insurance costs. G A costs decreased $0.45 million from $1.02
million, and decreased $1.31 million from $3.28 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, to
$0.57 million and $1.96 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  

Other
income (expense) . We incurred no interest or other expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. We have
determined that the three month interest-free period on the Notes is not material, and thus have chosen not to reduce the carrying
value of the notes for any small embedded discount. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a $0.01
million and $0.02 million gains, respectively, related to credits on vendor payables. We incurred interest expense on the Notes
of $0.07 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Change
in fair value liability for price adjustable warrants . The fair value liability is revalued each balance sheet date utilizing
Black-Scholes computations, with the decrease or increase in fair value being reported in the statement of operations as other
income or expense, respectively. Stock price decreases, offset by the modifications to the expiration dates on the Prior Warrants,
resulted in a $0.51 million and a $2.3 million gains during the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively.
Stock price decreases resulted in a $2.49 million gain and a $6.13 million gain during the three month and six month periods ended
September 30, 2015, respectively.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements     

As
of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation
S-K.  

ITEM
3   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     

Not
applicable.  

ITEM
4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

(a)
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures . As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing,
summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act.  

(b)
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
