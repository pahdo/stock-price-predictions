  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  
  Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
    
  Basis of Presentation  
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Echo Global Logistics, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Echo").  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation. The consolidated statements of operations include the results of entities or assets acquired from the effective date of the acquisition for accounting purposes.  
    
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements is in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules or regulations. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the period and those adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The operating results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year   2016  . These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates  
    
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results can differ from those estimates.  
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
    
  The carrying values of the Company's financial instruments, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair value of the due to seller liabilities are determined based on the likelihood of the Company making contingent earn-out payments (see Footnote 4).  The fair value of the contingent asset related to the Command Transportation, LLC ("Command") acquisition is determined based on the likelihood of the Company receiving contingent payments (see Footnote 3). The fair value of the liability component of the Notes (as defined in Footnote 11) was determined using the discounted cash flow analysis discussed in Footnote 11. 

2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows  ,     to provide specific guidance on cash flow classification issues for all entities. This new accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Full retrospective adoption is required, which applies the new standard to each prior reporting period presented.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the effects that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company's financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation:  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  The guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of share-based payment awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid-in capital pools. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. This new accounting standard will be effective beginning January 1, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the effects that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company s financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  .  This guidance requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.  This new accounting standard will be effective beginning January 1, 2019.  The Company is evaluating the effects that the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company s financial statements.  
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , which amends the guidance regarding the consolidation analysis performed by reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have decision maker or service provider fee arrangements and related-party relationships. This new accounting standard is effective as of January 1, 2016, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  , which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity s financial statements.  The accounting standard is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 
       
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , to clarify the principles used to recognize revenue for all entities.  Subsequently, the FASB has issued several additional ASUs to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, identifying performance obligations, assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers, non-cash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition.  All guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Two methods of adoption are permitted - a full retrospective method that applies the new standard to each prior reporting period presented, or a modified retrospective approach that recognizes the cumulative effect of applying the new standard at the date of initial application.  Early adoption is not permitted.  The Company is evaluating the transition method and the effects the adoption of this guidance will have on the Company s financial statements.  

3. Acquisitions  
    
  Command Transportation, LLC 
    
  On June 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding membership units of Command, one of the largest privately held truckload brokers and non-asset based transportation providers in the United States. Command was headquartered in Skokie, Illinois, with satellite locations in Texas, Missouri and Kansas.  In October 2016, the majority of Command employees previously located in Skokie moved to the Company's headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.  
    
  The Company financed the cash purchase price for the Command acquisition, in part, with the proceeds from the issuance of shares of its common stock and Notes. The Company financed the remainder of the cash purchase price for the Command acquisition with drawings under the ABL Facility (as defined in Footnote 11).  Additionally, a portion of the purchase price consisted of shares of Echo common stock issued to one of the sellers. The purchase price is reduced by a contingent consideration asset related to the retention of former Command employees.  The acquisition date fair value of the total consideration transferred was   $407.7 million  : 

The equity portion of the purchase price consisted of   503,829   unregistered shares of Echo common stock issued to Paul Loeb, the former owner of Command, on June 1, 2015.  The closing price of Echo common stock on June 1, 2015 was   $32.52   per share.  As these shares were unregistered, the Company applied a   10%   marketability discount to determine the fair value of the consideration transferred.

  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The following table summarizes the allocation of the total consideration transferred for the acquisition of Command:  

Goodwill of   $225,304,568  , which is approximately the amount of goodwill deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, represents the premium the Company paid over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets it acquired. The Company paid this premium because the acquisition of Command will, among other things, significantly enhance the Company's national scale and density in the highly fragmented truckload market. In addition, Echo paid this premium to acquire an experienced sales force with established customer and carrier relationships and Command executives with significant experience in the transportation industry.   
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adjusted the purchase price to recognize a   $1.2 million   contingent asset that may be due from the seller related to the retention of former Command employees. The fair value of the contingent asset at the acquisition date was determined based on the probability of the Company meeting certain employee retention criteria set forth in the purchase agreement.  The Company recorded the current and noncurrent portions of the contingent asset to other current assets and other noncurrent assets, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company will determine the fair value of the contingent asset each quarter based on the likelihood of meeting the employee retention criteria, and will record any change in fair value to selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.   The maximum amount the Company could have received under this agreement was   $1.5 million  .  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company received   $750,000   from the seller of Command after the Company met certain employee retention criteria set forth in the purchase agreement.  The Company calculated the fair value of the contingent asset as of   September 30, 2016   to be   $395,392  . 
    
  The fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired were as follows:  

The customer relationships are being amortized using an accelerated method, as an accelerated method best approximates the distribution of cash flows generated by the acquired customer relationships.  The carrier relationships, trade names and noncompete agreements are being amortized using the straight-line method. 
    
  On June 1, 2015, the Company issued   335,882   shares of restricted common stock to   33   Command employees as employment inducement awards pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).   This restricted common stock vested on June 1, 2016 and was recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period.  Additionally, at the closing, the Company issued

  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements

100,766   and   67,178   shares of restricted common stock and performance stock, respectively, to   two   of the sellers who entered into new employment agreements with the Company as employment inducement awards pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). This restricted common stock and performance stock vests over   3 years   and will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   33,588   and   33,589   shares of restricted common stock and performance stock, respectively, were outstanding.  The stock compensation expense related to these issuances for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016    was   $0.3 million   and   $5.5 million  , respectively.  For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the stock compensation expense related to these issuances was   $3.1 million   and   $4.2 million  . 

4. Fair Value Measurement  
    
  The Company applies ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,   for its financial assets and financial liabilities. The guidance requires disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The Company's financial liabilities primarily relate to contingent earn-out payments due to seller in connection with various acquisitions. The fair value of the due to seller liabilities at   September 30, 2016   was   $1.7 million  .  The potential earn-out payments and performance periods are defined in the individual purchase agreements for each acquisition.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") is the performance target defined and measured to determine the earnout payment due, if any, after each defined measurement period.   
    
  The Company's financial assets relate to contingent payments that may be due from the seller of Command if certain employee retention criteria are met. The fair value of the due from seller contingent asset at   September 30, 2016   was   $0.4 million  . The fair value of the due from seller contingent asset is determined based on the likelihood of the employee retention criteria being met. 
    
  ASC Topic 820 includes a fair value hierarchy that is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The fair value hierarchy is based on observable or unobservable inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity's pricing based upon its own market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:  

Level 1: Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2: Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs, which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 
                
    Level 3: Inputs that are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable. 
       
  The significant inputs used to derive the fair value of the amounts due to seller include financial forecasts of future operating results, the probability of reaching the forecast and an appropriate discount rate for each contingent liability. Probabilities are estimated by reviewing financial forecasts and assessing the likelihood of reaching the required performance measures based on factors specific to each acquisition as well as the Company s historical experience with similar arrangements. If an acquisition reaches the required performance measure, the estimated probability would be increased to   100%   and would still be classified as a contingent liability on the balance sheet.  If the measure is not reached, the probability would be reduced to reflect the amount earned, if any, depending on the terms of the agreement.  Discount rates used in determining the fair value of the contingent consideration due to seller ranged between   5%   and   6%  .  Historical results of the respective acquisitions serve as the basis for the financial forecasts used in the valuation.   
    
  Quantitative factors are also considered in these forecasts, including acquisition synergies, growth and sales potential, and potential operational efficiencies gained.  Changes to the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the contingent consideration due to seller could result in a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration.  However, the correlation and inverse relationship between higher projected financial results to the discount rate applied and probability of meeting the financial targets mitigates the effect of any changes to the unobservable inputs.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the assets measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): 

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized a benefit of   $71,929   and an expense of   $145,938  , respectively, in selling, general and administrative expense due to the change in fair value determined by a level three valuation technique.  These changes in fair value resulted from using revised forecasts that took into account the most recent performance at each acquired business, the effect of the time value of money and the likelihood of the employee retention criteria being met. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company made contingent earn-out payments of   $2,273,743   and   $2,945,833  , respectively, to the sellers of businesses acquired by the Company. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company received   $750,000   of contingent payments from the seller of Command. The Company did   no  t receive any contingent payments from the seller of Command in 2015.

5. Intangibles and Goodwill  
    
  The following is a roll-forward of goodwill from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  :  

The following is a summary of amortizable intangible assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :  

The customer relationships are being amortized using an accelerated method, as an accelerated method best approximates the distribution of cash flows generated by the acquired customer relationships.  The carrier relationships, trade names and noncompete agreements are being amortized using the straight-line method.  Amortization expense related to intangible assets was   $11,894,533   and   $7,534,302   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  The estimated amortization expense for the next five years and thereafter is as follows:  

6. Accrued Expenses and Other Noncurrent Liabilities 
    
  The components of accrued expenses at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:  

The other noncurrent liabilities of   $18,876,027   and   $2,940,435   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, consist of the portion of deferred rent in excess of twelve months and the long-term uncertain tax liability.

7. Income Taxes      
    
  The following table shows the Company's effective income tax rate for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The difference in the Company's effective tax rate for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from the Company's statutory federal tax rate of   35%   was primarily due to a tax credit related to a state incentive program.  

8. Earnings Per Share  
    
  Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average shares outstanding plus share equivalents that would arise from the exercise of share options and the vesting of restricted stock.  The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows:  

There were   no   employee stock options and   no   unvested restricted stock excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  
    
   As of   September 30, 2016  , none of the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert have been met and no conversion spread exists.  As such, the Notes did not have a dilutive impact on diluted earnings per common share for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

11. Long-Term Debt 
    
  ABL Facility 
    
  On June 1, 2015, the Company and Command, as co-borrowers, entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with PNC Bank.  The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to   $200 million   (the  ABL Facility ). The Company's obligations under the ABL facility are secured, on a first lien priority basis, by certain working capital assets.The initial aggregate principal amount under the ABL Facility may be increased from time to time by an additional   $100 million   to a maximum aggregate principal amount of   $300 million  . 
    
  Interest is payable at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Company, any of the following, plus, in each case, an applicable margin: (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds effective rate, plus   0.50%  , (2) the base commercial lending rate of PNC Bank, National Association and (3) a daily LIBOR rate, plus   1.00%  ; or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits in the relevant currency for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. The applicable margin is   0.25%   to   0.75%   for borrowings at the base rate and   1.25%   to   1.75%   for borrowings at the LIBOR rate, in each case, based on the excess availability under the ABL Facility.  
    
  The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee in respect to the unutilized commitments under the revolving credit facility of between   0.25%   and   0.375%   based on the excess availability for the prior calendar quarter under the ABL Facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's commitment fee was calculated at a rate of   0.375%  .  The Company recognized interest expense related to the commitment fee and borrowings on the ABL Facility of   $0.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

The Company drew   $12.5 million   on the ABL Facility during the third quarter of 2016, all of which was repaid as of   September 30, 2016  .   No   amounts were outstanding on the ABL Facility as of   September 30, 2016  . Since June 1, 2015, the Company has been in compliance with all covenants related to the ABL. 
    
  The issuance of letters of credit under the ABL Facility reduces available borrowings. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $0.7 million   of letters of credit outstanding.  The total draw allowed on the ABL Facility at   September 30, 2016  , as determined by the working capital assets pledged as collateral, was   $186.6 million  .  After adjusting for the letters of credit, the Company's remaining availability under the ABL Facility at   September 30, 2016   was   $185.9 million  . 
    
  The Company incurred issuance costs of   $3.1 million   in 2015 related to the ABL Facility. These issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense using straight-line amortization over the   5   year life of the ABL Facility. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $0.5 million   of interest expense related to ABL Facility issuance costs. As there is no outstanding draw on the ABL Facility at   September 30, 2016  , the unamortized issuance costs are presented as a deferred asset on the balance sheet. 
    
  Convertible Senior Notes 
    
  On May 5, 2015, the Company issued   $230 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.50%   convertible senior notes due 2020 (the  Notes ).  
    
  The Notes bear interest at a rate of   2.50%   per year payable semiannually in arrears in cash on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2015.  The Notes will mature on May 1, 2020, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with the terms discussed below. The Notes are the Company's senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company's secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company's subsidiaries. 
    
  The Notes will be convertible, under certain circumstances and during certain periods, into cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock at the Company's election, at an initial conversion rate of   25.5428   shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately   $39.15   per share of common stock.  
    
  The Company's intent and policy will be to settle the   $230 million   principal amount of Notes in cash, and any excess conversion premium in shares of common stock.  As such, the principal amount of the Notes will not be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share, but any conversion premium that exists will be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share using the treasury stock method. As of   September 30, 2016  , none of the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert have been met and no conversion spread exists.  As such, the notes did not have a dilutive impact on diluted earnings per common share for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The accounting guidance in ASC 470-20,   Debt with Conversion and Other Options,   requires that the principal amount of the Notes be separated into liability and equity components at issuance. The value assigned to the liability component is the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature. The difference between the principal amount of the Notes and the estimated fair value of the liability component, representing the value of the conversion premium assigned to the equity component, is recorded as a debt discount on the issuance date. The fair value of the liability component of the Notes was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, in which the projected interest and principal payments were discounted back to the issuance date of the Notes at an estimated market yield for a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature. The Company estimated the straight debt yield using a combination of inputs observable in the marketplace, including the credit spread indicated by the terms of the Company's ABL Facility, LIBOR rates, and U.S. Treasury bonds.  This represents a Level 2 valuation technique.  The Company estimated the straight debt borrowing rates at issuance to be   5.75%   for similar debt to the Notes without the conversion feature, which resulted in a fair value of the liability component of   $198.5 million   and a fair value of the equity component of   $31.5 million  . The fair value of the equity component was recorded as a debt discount, with the offset recorded as a credit to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity.  The   $31.5 million   debt discount and Note issuance costs discussed below are being amortized to interest expense under the effective interest method over the   5   year life of the Notes, using an effective interest rate of   6.33%  .

The Company allocated the total issuance costs related to the Notes to the liability and equity components based on their relative fair values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component were recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as a contra-liability that reduces the carrying amount of the convertible note liability.  This amount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest method and an effective interest rate of   6.33%  . Issuance costs attributable to the equity component were recorded as a charge to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity. 
    
    As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying amount of the Notes on the balance sheet was   $201.8 million  , calculated as follows: 

The Notes are carried on the balance sheet at their principal amount, net of the unamortized debt discount and unamortized debt issuance costs, and are not marked to market each period. The approximate fair value of the Notes as of   September 30, 2016   was   $216.2 million  . The fair value of the Notes was estimated based on the trading price of the Notes at   September 30, 2016  .  As trading volume is low, these are quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active, and thus are Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The Company recognized interest expense related to the Notes of   $9.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , consisting of   $4.3 million   of contractual coupon interest,   $4.3 million   of debt discount amortization and   $0.8 million   of debt issuance cost amortization.   
    
  The Company recognized interest expense related to the Notes of   $5.0 million   from the issuance date through September 30, 2015, consisting of   $2.3 million   of contractual coupon interest,   $2.3 million   of debt discount amortization and   $0.4 million   of debt issuance cost amortization. 
    
  The undiscounted interest and principal payments due in relation to the Notes from   September 30, 2016   to the maturity of the Notes on May 1, 2020 are as follows: 

12. Related Parties 
    
  As of the closing of the Command acquisition on June 1, 2015, the Company leases the former Command headquarters in Skokie, Illinois, from a company owned by Paul Loeb, the former owner of Command who joined the Echo Board of Directors in June 2015.   The lease requires monthly rental payments of   $54,638   for the duration of the lease, which ends on December 31, 2018.  The Company is obligated to pay real estate taxes, insurance and all building maintenance costs in addition to the minimum rental payments for the facility related to this lease.  The total rental expense related to this lease included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $491,742  . All amounts due under the lease were paid as of   September 30, 2016  , and thus there was   no   liability due to the related party at   September 30, 2016  .

  Overview    
    
  We are a leading provider of technology-enabled transportation and supply chain management solutions.  We utilize a proprietary technology platform to compile and analyze data from our multi-modal network of transportation providers to satisfy the transportation and logistics needs of our clients.  This model enables us to quickly adapt to and offer efficient and cost-effective solutions for our clients' shipping needs.  We focus primarily on arranging transportation by truckload ("TL") and less-than-truckload ("LTL") carriers. We also offer intermodal (which involves moving a shipment by rail and truck), small parcel, domestic air, expedited and international transportation services. Our core logistics services include rate negotiation, shipment execution and tracking, carrier management, routing compliance and performance management reporting.  
    
  We procure transportation and provide logistics services for clients across a wide range of industries, such as manufacturing, construction, food and beverage, consumer products and retail. Our clients fall into two categories: Transactional and Managed Transportation.  We provide transportation and logistics services to our Transactional clients on a shipment-by-shipment basis, typically with individual, or spot market, pricing.  We typically enter into multi-year contracts with our Managed Transportation clients, which are often on an exclusive basis for a specific transportation mode or point of origin.  As part of our value proposition, we also provide core logistics services to these clients.

  The following table represents certain results of operations data: 

(1) Net revenue is a non-GAAP measure calculated as revenue less transportation costs. Net revenue is one of the primary operational and financial measures used by management to evaluate the business. The following table presents a reconciliation of net revenue to revenue, the most comparable GAAP measure:

Table of Contents  

Revenue  
    
  We generate revenue through the sale of transportation and logistics services to our clients. Revenue is recognized when the client's product is delivered by a third-party carrier.  Our revenue was   $1.3 billion   and   $1.1 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, representing a period-over-period   increase   of   18.5%  . 
    
  Our revenue is generated from two different types of clients: Managed Transportation and Transactional. We categorize a client as a Managed Transportation client if we have a contract with the client for the provision of services on a recurring basis. Our contracts with Managed Transportation clients typically have a multi-year term and are often on an exclusive basis for a specific transportation mode or point of origin. In several cases, we provide substantially all of a client's transportation and logistics requirements. We categorize all other clients as Transactional clients. We provide services to our Transactional clients on a shipment-by-shipment basis.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , revenue from Transactional clients accounted for   81.5%   and   80.4%   of our total revenue, respectively, and revenue from Managed Transportation clients accounted for   18.5%   and   19.6%   of our total revenue, respectively. We expect to continue to grow both our Managed Transportation and Transactional client base in the future, although the rate of growth for each type of client will vary depending on opportunities in the marketplace.  
    
  Revenue recognized per shipment will vary depending on the transportation mode, fuel prices, shipment weight, density and mileage of the product shipped. The primary modes of shipment that we transact in are TL, LTL and intermodal. Other transportation modes include small parcel, domestic air, expedited and international. Material shifts in the percentage of our revenue by transportation mode could have a significant impact on our revenue growth.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , TL accounted for   67.7%   of our revenue, LTL accounted for   26.2%   of our revenue, intermodal accounted for   4.4%   of our revenue and other transportation modes accounted for   1.7%   of our revenue.  For the   nine   months ended ended   September 30, 2015  , TL accounted for   62.2%   of our revenue, LTL accounted for   31.0%   of our revenue, intermodal accounted for   5.1%   of our revenue and other transportation modes accounted for   1.7%   of our revenue. 
    
  The transportation industry has historically been subject to seasonal sales fluctuations as shipments generally are lower during and after the winter holiday season because many companies ship goods and stock inventories prior to the winter holiday season. While we experience some seasonality, differences in our revenue between periods have been driven primarily by growth in our client base. 

Transportation costs and net revenue    
    
  We act primarily as a service provider to add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics services for our clients. Our pricing structure is primarily variable, although we have entered into a limited number of fixed-fee arrangements that represent an insignificant portion of our revenue. Net revenue equals revenue minus transportation costs. Our transportation costs consist primarily of the direct cost of transportation paid to the carrier.  
    
  Net revenue is considered by management to be an important measurement of our success in the marketplace. Our transportation costs are typically lower for an LTL shipment than for a TL shipment.  Our net revenue margin is typically higher for an LTL shipment than for a TL shipment. Material shifts in the percentage of our revenue by transportation mode could have a significant impact on our net revenue. The discussion of our results of operations below focuses on changes in our net revenue and expenses as a percentage of net revenue.  Net revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $246.9 million  , an   increase   of   17.5%   from   $210.2 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  

Operating expenses    
    
  Our costs and expenses, excluding transportation costs, consist of commissions paid to our sales personnel, general and administrative expenses to run our business, changes in our contingent consideration, acquisition-related transaction costs, and depreciation and amortization.  
    
  Commissions paid to our sales personnel, including employees and agents, are a significant component of our operating expenses. These commissions are based on the net revenue we collect from the clients for which such sales personnel have primary responsibility.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our commission expense was   $73.9 million   and   $61.8 million  , respectively. Commission expense was   29.9%   and   29.4%   of our net revenue in the current and prior year, respectively.  The   increase   is due to the fluctuation of the composition of our net revenue by mode, as TL shipments typically have higher commission percentages than other modes.  The percentage of net revenue paid as commissions will vary depending on the type of client, composition of the sales team and mode of transportation. Commission expense, stated as a  
  
    20 

     Table of Contents  

percentage of net revenue, could increase or decrease in the future depending on the composition and sources of our revenue growth. 
    
  We accrue for commission expense when we recognize the related revenue. Some of our sales personnel receive a monthly advance to provide them with a more consistent income stream. Cash paid to our sales personnel in advance of commissions earned is recorded as a prepaid expense. As our sales personnel earn commissions, a portion of their commission payment is withheld and offset against their prepaid commission balance, if any. Prepaid commissions and accrued commissions are presented on a net basis on our balance sheet.  
    
  Our selling, general and administrative expenses, which exclude commission expense and changes to contingent consideration, consist of compensation costs for our sales, operations, information systems, finance and administrative support employees as well as occupancy costs, professional fees, acquisition-related transactions costs, and other general and administrative expenses.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our selling, general and administrative expenses were   $132.5 million   and   $114.8 million  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue were   53.7%   and   54.6%  , respectively.  The   decrease   in this percentage was primarily attributable to increases in net revenue from the Command acquisition. 
    
  Our contingent consideration expense or benefit is the change in the fair value of our contingent consideration assets and liabilities.  The contingent consideration assets and liabilities presented on our consolidated balance sheets reflect the fair value of expected earn-out payments that may be paid or received from the sellers of certain acquired businesses upon the achievement of certain performance measures.  The fair values of the contingent consideration assets and liabilities are evaluated on a quarterly basis, and the change in fair value is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded a benefit of   $0.1 million   and a charge of   $0.1 million  , respectively, due to fair value adjustments to our contingent consideration assets and liabilities. 
    
  Our depreciation expense is primarily attributable to our depreciation of computer hardware and software, equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and internally developed software. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , depreciation expense was   $11.8 million   and   $9.0 million  , respectively.  The   increase   is primarily due to the depreciation of property and equipment acquired during the prior twelve months, including property and equipment at Command.   
    
  Our amortization expense is attributable to our amortization of intangible assets acquired from business combinations, including customer and carrier relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , amortization expense was   $11.9 million   and   $7.5 million  , respectively. The   increase   is due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of Command. 

Interest expense 
    
  The interest expense included in our consolidated statements of operations consists of interest expense related to our $230 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% convertible senior notes due 2020 issued in May 2015 (the "Notes") and our senior secured revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $200 million entered into in June 2015 (the "ABL Facility"). We amortize the debt discount and issuance costs related to the Notes over the 5 year life of the Notes using the effective interest method.  We amortize the issuance costs related to our ABL Facility over the 5 year life of the facility using straight-line amortization, as the amount drawn on the line (and thus the interest rate and commitment fee paid by Echo) will fluctuate from period to period.  Interest expense was   $10.6 million   and   $7.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   

Comparison of the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  Revenue    
    
  Revenue for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $460.2 million  , an   increase   of   2.3%   from   $450.0 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   increase   in revenue was attributable to increase in volume partially offset by both lower rates and fuel prices.

     Table of Contents  

Revenue from Transactional clients for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $373.1 million  , a   decrease   of   0.6%   from   $375.3 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  Revenue from Transactional clients was   81.1%   of our total revenue for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   from   83.4%   of our total revenue in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   decrease   in Transactional revenue was driven by the decline in rates, offset by an increase in volume. 
    
  Revenue from Managed Transportation clients for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $87.1 million  , an   increase   of   16.6%   from   $74.7 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  Revenue from Managed Transportation clients was   18.9%   of our total revenue for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   from   16.6%   of total revenue in the comparable period of   2015  .  This   increase   was driven by an increase in the number of Managed Transportation clients and the growth of our current clients.   
    
  Transportation costs  
    
  Transportation costs for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $379.3 million  , an   increase   of   4.6%   from   $362.6 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .   The growth in the total number of shipments drove the   increase   in our transportation costs during this period. Our transportation costs as a percentage of revenue   increased   to   82.4%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   80.6%   in the comparable period of   2015  , which is due to the decline in TL margins. 
    
  Net revenue    
    
  Net revenue for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $80.9 million  , a   decrease   of   7.5%   from   $87.4 million   in the comparable period of   2015  . Net revenue margins   decreased   to   17.6%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   19.4%   in the comparable period of   2015  . The decline in TL margins accounted for most of the   decrease   in our net revenue during this period.   
    
  Operating expenses  
    
  Commission expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $23.8 million  , a   decrease   of   9.9%   from   $26.5 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , commission expense was   29.5%   and   30.3%  , respectively, of our net revenue. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in net revenue. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $42.4 million  , a   decrease   of   5.5%   from   $44.9 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   decrease   is primarily due to the decrease in stock compensation expense related to the restricted stock grants to Command employees, which fully vested on June 1, 2016.  As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses   increased   to   52.4%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   51.4%   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   increase   is primarily due to an increase in integration costs during the third quarter of 2016 and lower net revenue. 
    
  The contingent consideration fair-value adjustment resulted in an expense of   $0.05 million   and a benefit of   $0.02 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The fair value of the contingent consideration assets and liabilities reflect updated probabilities and assumptions as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Depreciation expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $4.6 million  , an   increase   of   38.1%   from   $3.3 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   increase   in depreciation expense was primarily attributable to depreciation on additional purchases of computer hardware and software, equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and internally developed software.   
    
  Amortization expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $3.9 million  , a   decrease   of   4.4%   from   $4.1 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   decrease   in amortization expense was attributable to the complete amortization of previously acquired intangible assets 
    
  Income from operations  
    
  Income from operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $6.0 million  , a   decrease   of   30.0%   from   $8.6 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   decrease   in income from operations is primarily due to the increase in integration costs and lower net revenue.

Interest expense 
    
  Interest expense was   $3.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   from   $3.4 million   of interest expense in the comparable period of   2015  .  The interest expense in both years primarily relates to our Notes issued in May 2015 and the ABL Facility we entered into in June 2015.  
    
  Income tax expense 
    
  We recognized income tax expense of   $0.1 million   and   $1.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   4.0%  , compared to an effective tax rate of   33.4%   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   decrease   in the effective tax rate in the current quarter was primarily due to a tax credit related to a state incentive program.  
       
  Net Income  
    
  Net income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.4 million  , compared to   $3.5 million   in the comparable period of   2015  , due to the items previously discussed.  

Comparison of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  Revenue    
    
  Revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.3 billion  , an   increase   of   18.5%   from   $1.1 billion   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   increase   in revenue was attributable to revenue from Command, which we acquired in June 2015, and volume gains, partially offset by both lower rates and fuel prices.  Command contributed   $366.3 million   of revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . In the prior year, Command contributed   $170.2 million   of revenue from the acquisition date through September 30, 2015. 
    
  Revenue from Transactional clients for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.1 billion  , an   increase   of   20.2%   from   $888.1 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  Revenue from Transactional clients was   81.5%   of our total revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   from   80.4%   of our total revenue in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   increase   in Transactional revenue was driven by transactional revenue from Command.  
    
  Revenue from Managed Transportation clients for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $242.2 million  , an   increase   of   11.6%   from   $217.1 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  This   increase   was driven by an increase in the number of Managed Transportation clients and an increase in revenue per Managed Transportation client.  Revenue from Managed Transportation clients was   18.5%   of our total revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   from   19.6%   of total revenue in the comparable period of   2015  .  This   decrease   was driven by an increase in the number of Transactional shipments due to the acquisition of Command. 

Transportation costs  
    
  Transportation costs for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $1.1 billion  , an   increase   of   18.7%   from   $895.0 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  Our transportation costs as a percentage of revenue   increased   to   81.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   81.0%   in the comparable period of   2015  . The growth in the total number of shipments attributable to Command drove the   increase   in our transportation costs during this period. 

Net revenue    
    
  Net revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $246.9 million  , an   increase   of   17.5%   from   $210.2 million   in the comparable period of   2015  . The growth in the total number of shipments attributable to Command accounted for most of the   increase   in our net revenue during this period.  Net revenue margins   decreased   to   18.9%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   19.0%   in the comparable period of   2015  , as a result of an decrease in TL margins.

Operating expenses  
    
  Commission expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $73.9 million  , an   increase   of   19.6%   from   $61.8 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .    For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , commission expense was   29.9%   and   29.4%  , respectively, of our net revenue.  This   increase   was due to the fluctuation in the composition of our net revenue by mode, as TL shipments typically have higher commission percentages than other modes. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $132.5 million  , an   increase   of   15.3%   from   $114.8 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   increase   is primarily due to the Command selling, general and administrative expenses included in our consolidated statements of operations in 2016.  As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses   decreased   to   53.7%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   54.6%   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   decrease   in this percentage was primarily attributable the Command acquisition. 
    
  The contingent consideration fair-value adjustment resulted in a benefit of   $0.1 million   and an expense of   $0.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The fair values of the contingent consideration assets and liabilities reflect updated probabilities and assumptions as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Depreciation expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $11.8 million  , an   increase   of   30.3%   from   $9.0 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   increase   in depreciation expense was primarily attributable to depreciation on additional purchases of computer hardware and software, equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and internally developed software.   
    
  Amortization expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $11.9 million  , an   increase   of   57.9%   from   $7.5 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   increase   in amortization expense was attributable to the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of  Command. 
    
  Income from operations  
    
  Income from operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $16.9 million  , an   increase   of   0.5%   from   $16.8 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  
    
  Interest expense 
    
  Interest expense was   $10.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   from   $7.8 million   of interest expense in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   increase   in interest expense was related to our Notes issued in May 2015 and the ABL Facility we entered into in June 2015, partially offset by the $2.0 million in one-time interest expense recognized in 2015 related to the expiration of our term loan facility. 
    
  Income tax expense 
    
  We recognized income tax expense of   $1.7 million   and   $2.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   27.7%  , compared to an effective tax rate of   31.4%   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The   decrease   in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax credit related to a state incentive program. 
       
  Net Income  
    
  Net income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $4.6 million  , compared to   $6.1 million   of net income in the comparable period of   2015  , due to the items previously discussed. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $34.2 million   in cash and cash equivalents,   $110.3 million   in working capital and   $185.9 million   available under our ABL Facility.

Cash provided by operating activities  
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $55.1 million   and   $52.8 million  , respectively. We generated   $47.7 million   and   $33.4 million   in cash from net income (adjusted for noncash operating items) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  In the current year, we generated   $7.4 million   of cash due to changes in working capital, compared to   $19.4 million   in the prior year.  These fluctuations in working capital were primarily driven by the timing of payments made and received each year. 
    
  Cash used in investing activities  
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net cash used in investing activities was   $37.2 million   and   $400.5 million  , respectively.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the primary investing activities were the purchase of property and equipment, leasehold improvements and the internal development of computer software.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the primary investing activities were the acquisition of Command, the purchase of property and equipment and the internal development of computer software. 
    
  Cash (used in) provided by financing activities  
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash used in financing activities was   $40.2 million  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , net cash provided by financing activities was   $358.0 million  .  In 2016, the primary financing activities were the purchase of treasury stock, the payment of contingent consideration, and the use of cash to satisfy employee tax withholdings upon the vesting of restricted stock. We also drew   $23.5 million   on our ABL Facility (all of which was repaid as of   September 30, 2016  ). In 2015, we generated $223.1 million in cash from the issuance of our Notes (net of underwriting discounts and commissions), $158.4 million from the issuance of our common stock (net of underwriting discounts and commissions), and we also drew $35.0 million on our ABL Facility (all of which was repaid as of September 30, 2015). This cash generation was partially offset by payments of $17.5 million to the former owner of One Stop Logistics, the payment of $4.1 million of debt and equity issuance costs, and the payment of $2.9 million to settle contingent consideration obligations. 
    
  ABL Facility  
    
  On June 1, 2015, we entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement with PNC Bank (the "Credit Agreement").  The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $200 million. Our obligations under the ABL Facility are secured, on a first lien priority basis, by certain working capital assets.  
    
  Interest is payable at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, any of the following, plus, in each case, an applicable margin: (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds effective rate, plus 0.50%, (2) the base commercial lending rate of PNC Bank, National Association and (3) a daily LIBOR rate, plus 1.00%; or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits in the relevant currency for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs. The applicable margin will be 0.25% to 0.75% for borrowings at the base rate and 1.25% to 1.75% for borrowings at the LIBOR rate, in each case, based on the excess availability under the ABL Facility.  We will also be required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments under the revolving credit facility of between 0.25% and 0.375% based on the excess availability for the prior calendar quarter under the ABL Facility.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , there was no outstanding balance on the ABL Facility.  The issuance of letters of credit under the ABL Facility also reduces available borrowings. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $0.7 million   of letters of credit outstanding.  The total draw allowed under the ABL Facility at   September 30, 2016  , as determined by the working capital assets pledged as collateral, was   $186.6 million  .  After adjusting for the letters of credit, our remaining availability under the ABL Facility at   September 30, 2016   was   $185.9 million  . 
    
  Anticipated uses of cash    
    
  Our priority is to continue to grow our revenue and net revenue. We anticipate that our operating expenses and planned expenditures will constitute material uses of cash, and we expect to use available cash to expand our sales force, to enhance our technology, to acquire or make strategic investments in complementary businesses, to integrate our technology and business with the technology and business of Command, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We also expect to use available cash to make contingent earn-out payments and to make the $2.9 million semi-annual Note coupon payment due November 1, 2016. We currently expect to use approximately $11 million for capital expenditures for the remainder of   2016  .   
  
    25 

     Table of Contents  

We expect our use of cash for working capital purposes and other purposes to be offset by the cash flow generated from operating activities during the same period. 
    
  Historically, our average accounts receivable life-cycle has been longer than our average accounts payable life-cycle, meaning that we have used cash to pay carriers in advance of collecting from our clients. We elect to provide this benefit to foster strong relationships with our clients and carriers. As our business grows, we expect this use of cash to continue. The amount of cash we use will depend on the growth of our business. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
    
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Contractual Obligations 
    
  On February 17, 2016, we signed an 11 year lease for an additional 132,000 square feet at our Chicago, Illinois headquarters, bringing our total leased square footage at our headquarters to 224,678 square feet. As of   September 30, 2016  , we continue to also lease over 30 branch sales offices, with average lease terms between 3-5 years. Our future minimum annual rent payments for these operating leases are as follows: 

Other than this Chicago headquarters lease and the payment of   $2,273,743   of contingent consideration due to seller discussed in Footnote 4, there have been no material changes in the outstanding contractual obligations disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
    
  Commodity Risk  
    
  We pass through fluctuations in fuel prices to our clients. As a result, we believe that there is no material risk exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices.   
    
  Interest Rate Risk  
    
  We have exposure to changes in interest rates on our ABL Facility. Borrowings bear interest at one of the following, plus an applicable margin: (1) the federal funds rate, (2) the base commercial lending rate of PNC Bank, or (3) the LIBOR rate, based on the Company's election for each tranche of borrowing.  The interest rate on our line of credit fluctuates based on the rates described above.  Assuming the $200.0 million ABL Facility was fully drawn, a 1.0% increase in the interest rate selected would increase our annual interest expense by $2.0 million.  
    
  Our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, in particular because all of our investments are in cash equivalents.  Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we believe that there is no material risk exposure.  
    
  We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.  
    
  Impact of Inflation  
    
  We believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate.  Inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures  
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
    
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.  Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  
    
  Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Based on its evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  SECTION 302 Of THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002  
    
  I, Douglas R. Waggoner, certify that:  
  1.   I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Echo Global Logistics, Inc.;  
  2.   Based on my knowledge, this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this quarterly report;  
  3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this quarterly report;  
  4.   The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  
  a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this quarterly report is being prepared;  
  b)    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;  
  c)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this quarterly report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report based on such evaluation; and  
  d)   disclosed in this quarterly report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and  
    
  5.   The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  
  a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
  b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
