Lumos Networks   Corp. 

Note 1.  Organization 

Lumos Networks Corp. ( Lumos Networks  or the  Company ) is a fiber-based bandwidth infrastructure and service provider in the Mid-Atlantic region with a network of long-haul fiber, metro Ethernet and Ethernet rings located primarily in Virginia and West Virginia, and portions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kentucky.  The Company serves carrier, business and residential customers over its fiber network offering data, voice and IP services.  The Company s principal products and services include Multiprotocol Label Switching ( MPLS ) based Ethernet, Metro Ethernet ( Metro E ), Fiber to the Cell ( FTTC ) wireless backhaul and fiber transport services, wavelength transport services, IP services and other voice services. 

Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, Lumos Networks Operating Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and all of Lumos Networks Operating Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries and those limited liability corporations where Lumos Networks Operating Company or certain of its subsidiaries, as managing member, exercise control.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly in all material respects the Company s financial position and the results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented on the respective condensed consolidated financial statements included herein.  The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .     Certain presentation changes have been made within the operating expense line items on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and prior period amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year presentation. Specifically, the previously reported line item  network access costs  has been removed and the new line item  cost of revenue  has been added along with the necessary operating expense reclassifications. These reclassifications were not the result of an error and have no effect on previously reported operating income, net income or earnings per share. 

Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of   condensed   consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the   condensed   consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include t  he useful lives of fixed assets,   the allowance for doubtful accounts   and customer credits,   deferred tax as  sets  ,   marketable securities, asset retirement obligations, stock warrant  s and equity-based compensation,     goodwill impairment assessments,   reserves for employee benefit obligations and income tax uncertainties. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services are rendered or products are delivered, installed and functional, as applicable, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  Certain services of the Company require payment in advance of service performance.  In such cases, the Company records a service liability at the time of billing and subsequently recognizes revenue ratably over the service period.  The Company bills customers certain transactional taxes on service revenues.  These transactional taxes are not included in reported revenues as they are recognized as liabilities at the time customers are billed. 

The Company earns revenue by providing services through access to and usage of its networks.  Local service revenues are recognized as services are provided.  Carrier data revenues are earned by providing switched access and other switched and dedicated services to other carriers.  Revenues for equipment sales are recognized at the point of sale.

Table Of Contents  

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 

The Company considers its investment in all highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.  The Company s marketable securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consist of debt securities not classified as cash equivalents. The Company classifies such debt securities as either held-to-maturity, when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity, or available-for-sale.  Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax.  All of the Company s debt securities not classified as cash equivalents were classified as available-for-sale securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Trade Accounts Receivable 

The Company sells its services to other communication carriers and to business and residential customers primarily in Virginia and West Virginia and portions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kentucky.  The Company has credit and collection policies to maximize collection of trade receivables and requires advance payment for certain services.  The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a review of specific customers with large receivable balances and for the remaining customer receivables the Company uses historical results, current and expected trends and changes in credit policies.  Management believes the allowance adequately covers all anticipated losses with respect to trade receivables.  Actual credit losses could differ from such estimates.  The Company includes bad debt expense in selling, general and administrative in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.    Bad debt expense for     the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   less than   $0.1     million   and   $0.2   million, respectively, and bad debt expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was   $0.2   million and   $0.4   million, respectively.    The Company s allowance for doubtful accounts   and customer credits   was $  1.1   million   and $1.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015, respectively  . 

The following table presents a roll-forward of the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts and customer credits from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016:    

Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Long-Lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets) 

Property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and long-term deferred charges are recorded at cost and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be evaluated pursuant to the subsequent measurement guidance described in F  inancial Accounting Standards Board ( F  ASB   )   Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 360-10-35.  Impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long-lived assets to management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets.  If the carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, the excess of the asset s carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded as an impairment charge.   

The Company believes that no impairment indicators exist as of   September 30, 2016   that would require the Company to perform impairment testing for long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, long-term deferred charges and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used. 

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets,   which the Company reviews and updates based on historical experiences and future expectations.    Plant and equipment held under capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.  Amortization of assets held under capital leases, including   an indefeasible right of use agreement  , is included with depreciation expense  .

Table Of Contents  

Intangibles with a finite life are classified as other intangibles on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , other intangibles wer  e comprised of the following: 

Included in the above amounts are indefinite  -  lived intangible   assets     of $0.3 million, which are not subject to amortization.     The Company amortizes its finite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method unless it determines that another systematic method is more appropriate.  The amortization for certain customer relationship intangibles is being recognized using an accelerated amortization method based on the pattern of estimated earnings from these assets. 

The estimated life of amortizable intangible assets is determined from the unique factors specific to each asset, and the Company periodically   reviews and updates estimated lives based on current events and future expectations.      The Company capitalizes costs incurred to renew or extend the term of a recognized intangible asset and amortizes such costs over the remaining life of the asset. No such costs were incurred during the   three or nine months ended September 30, 2016  .    Amortization expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     was $0.  6   million and $  0  .  7   million, respectively  , and amortization for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was $  1  .  9   million   and $  4  .  1   million, respectively. 

Amortization expense for the remainder of 201  6   and for the next five years is expected to be as follows: 

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 

Goodwill and certain trademarks are considered to be indefinite-lived intangible assets.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are instead tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event indicates that the asset might be impaired.  The Company s policy is to assess the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually on October 1 and whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.        The Company believes there have been no events or circumstances to cause it to evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Pension Benefits and Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions 

The Company sponsors a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the  Pension Plan ) covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements and were employed prior to October 1, 2003.  The Company froze the Pension Plan effective December 31, 2012. As such, no further benefits are being accrued by participants for services rendered beyond that date. 

For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the components of the Company s net periodic benefit   cost (  income  )   for the   Pension Plan were as follows: 

10   

Table Of Contents  

Pension Plan assets were valued at $5  4  .  8   million and $5  3.9   million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  No funding contributions were made     during the   three or nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and the Company does not expect to make a funding contribution during the remainder of 201  6  . 

The Company also provides life insurance benefits for retired employees that meet eligibility requirements through two postretirement welfare benefit plans (the  Other Postretirement Benefit Plans ).  The Company had provided retiree medical benefits under these plans until those benefits were terminated effective   December 31, 201  4  .  The Company did not incur any significant costs associated with these plans during the   three or     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or 2015  . 

The Company recognized expense for certain nonqualified pension plans for each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   of $0.1 million, and   less than $0.1 million   of this expense for   each of   these periods relates to the a  mortization of actuarial loss.    Expense for nonqualified pension plans for   each of   the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   was $0.  4   million, and $  0  .  2   million and $0.  3   million of this expense for each period, respectively, relates to the amortization of actuarial loss. 

The   gross   amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss related to amortization of actuarial losses for retirement plans for   each of   the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     was $  0.3   million and   $  1.0   million for   each of   the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  ,    all of which has been reclassified to   selling, general and administrative   on the condensed consolidated statements of   operations  .   Income taxes associated with these reclassifications were $0.1 million for each of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015   and $  0  .  4   million   for   each of   the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015  .   

Equity-based Compensation  

The Company accounts for share-based employee compensation plans under FASB ASC 718,   Stock Compensation  .    Equity-based compensation expense from share-based equity awards is recorded with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.  For equity awards with only service conditions, the Company recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.       

Total equity-based compensation expense related to all of the share-based awards  , annual employee bonuses paid in the form of immediately vested   shares   and the Company s 401(k) matching contributions was $  1.  7   million and $1.  5   million for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively,     and $  8  .  5   million   and $  4  .  2   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively,   which amounts are included in   selling, general and administrative   expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of   operations  .   

Future charges for equity-based compensation related to instruments outstanding at   September 30, 2016   are estimated to be $  1  .  1   million for the remainder of 201  6  , $  3  .  4   million in 201  7  , $  1  .  5   million in 201  8  , $  0  .  2   million in 201  9  , and less than $0.1 million thereafter.       

Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value or for certain financial instruments for which disclosure of fair value is required, the Company uses fair value techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible.  However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company s own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  Those judgments are developed by the Company based on the best information available in the circumstances, including expected cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates, available observable and unobservable inputs.  

GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1     Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.     

Level 2     Unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.     

Level 3     Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.     

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the FASB issued   Accounting Standards Update (   ASU   )   2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 )  , which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)     -    Deferral of the  

11   

Table Of Contents  

Effective Date  , which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for public business entities from annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Gross versus Net)   ( ASU 2016-08 )  , which clarifies implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU 2016-10 )  , which clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in ASU 2014-09.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 )  , which addresses narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideration, and completed contracts at transition. Additionally, the amendments in ASU 2016-12 provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers. The Company will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, and ASU 2016-12 as of January 1, 2018.   The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is still evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 820): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02 ).  ASU 2015-02 provides a revised consolidation model for all reporting entities to use in evaluating whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  All legal entities will be subject to reevaluation under this revised consolidation model.  The revised consolidation model, among other things, (i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and (iii) modifies the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs through fee arrangements and related party relationships.  ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after September 1, 2016.  The Company does not expect the future adoption of ASU 2015-02 to have a material impact on     its   consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Topic 825): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01 ). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for   public business entities for   fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company does not expect the future adoption of ASU 2016-01 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ), which will replace most existing lease guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize most leases, including operating leases, on the consolidated balance sheet of the lessee. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  ASU 2016-02 requires the use of a modified retrospective transition method with elective reliefs.  The Company is still evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures  . 

In   March   2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-  09  , Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718) ( ASU 2016-  09   ), which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions.

Note 4.  Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information 

The Company s operating segments generally align with its major product and service offerings and coincide with the way that the Company s chief operating decision makers measure performance and allocate resources.  The Company s chief operating decision makers are its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer (collectively, the  CODMs ).  The Company s current reportable operating segments are data, residential and small business ( R SB ) and RLEC access.  A general description of the products and services offered and the customers served by each of these segments is as follows: 

Data:    This segment includes the Company s enterprise data (metro Ethernet, dedicated Internet, voice over IP ( VoIP ) and private line), transport, and FTTC product and service groups.  These businesses primarily serve enterprise and carrier customers utilizing the Company s network of long-haul fiber, metro Ethernet and Ethernet rings located primarily in Virginia and West Virginia, and portions of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio and Kentucky.     

R SB:    This segment includes the following voice products:  local lines, primary rate interface ( PRI ), long distance, toll and directory advertising and other voice services (excluding VoIP which are typically provided to enterprise customers and are included in the Company s data segment) and the following IP services products: fiber-

to-the-premise broadband XL, DSL, integrated access and video.  These products are sold to residential and small business customers on the Company s network and within the Company s footprint.  This segment also provides carrier customers access to the Company s network located in competitive markets.      

RLEC Access:    This segment provides carrier customers access to the Company s network within the Company s RLEC footprint and primarily includes switched access services.      

Summarized financial information concerning the Company s reportable segments is presented in the following table:

Table Of Contents  

(1)       Adjusted EBITDA is used by the Company s CODMs to evaluate performance. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Company, is net income or loss attributable to Lumos Networks Corp. before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations, net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, other income or expenses, equity-based compensation charges, amortization of actuarial losses on retirement plans, employee separation charges, restructuring-related charges,   acquisition and     separation related charges,   gain or loss on settlements and gain or loss on interest rate swap derivatives. 

(2)      In the first quarter of 2016, the Company refined its methodology for allocating certain operating costs to the segments, resulting in immaterial changes to previously reported segment Adjusted EBITDA amounts for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 

N/A   Not Applicable   (as totals are not presented in the consolidated statements of operations) 

The Company s CODMs do not currently review total assets by segment since the assets are centrally managed and some of the assets are shared by the segments.  However, total assets may be allocated to the segments in the future should the CODMs decide to manage the business in that manner.  Management does review capital expenditures using success-based metrics that allow the Company to determine which segment product groups are driving investment in the network.  Depreciation and amortization expense and certain corporate expenses that are excluded from the measurement of segment profit or loss are not alloca  ted to the operating segments. 

The following table provides a reconc  iliation of the total of the Company s   reportable segments measure of profit to   the Company s   consolidated income before income taxes     for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

The Company does not currently have   any   single customer that   individually accounted for more than 10% of the Company s total operating revenues. The Company s five largest carrier customers, in the aggregate, accounted for     32%     of      the Company s total operating revenues for   each of   the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   31  %     of   the Company s total operating revenues   for each of the three and nine months ended September 30,   2015.    Revenues from these carrier customers were derived primarily from network access, data transport and FTTC services.

Note 5.  Long-Term Debt 

As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company s outstanding long-term debt consisted of the following:   

Credit Facility 

On April 30, 2013, Lumos Networks Operating Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a   $425   million credit facility (the  Credit Facility ).  The Credit Facility consists of a   $100   million senior secured   five  -year term loan ( Term Loan A ), a   $275   million senior secured   six  -year term loan ( Term Loan B ); a   $28   million senior secured incremental term loan, which was added through an amendment to the Credit Facility dated January 2, 2015, ( Term Loan C ); and a   $50   million senior secured   five  -year revolving credit facility (the  Revolver ).  The proceeds from Term Loan A and Term Loan B were used to retire the prior first lien credit facility outstanding amount of approximately $  311   million and to pay closing costs and other expenses related to the transaction, with the remaining proceeds available for normal course capital expenditures and working capital purposes.  The Company   used   the net proceeds from Term Loan C to fund new FTTC projects. As of   September 30, 2016  ,    no   borrowings were outstanding under the Revolver. 

On August 6, 2015, the Company prepaid   $40.0   million of the outstanding principal of the Credit Facility, which was allocated ratably to Term Loans A, B and C.  The Company used proceeds from the issuance of the 8% Notes due 2022, discussed below, to fund these prepayments.  

Pricing of the amended Credit Facility is LIBOR plus   3.00%   for the Revolver and   Term Loan A   and LIBOR plus   3.25%   for   Term Loan B   and   C  .  The Credit Facility does not require a minimum LIBOR rate.  Term Loan A matures in 2018 with quarterly payments of   1.25%   per annum through December 31, 2016 and   2.50%   per annum thereafter.  Term Loan B matures in 2019 with quarterly payments of   1%   per annum.  Term Loan C matures in 2019 with quarterly payments of   1%   per annum.  The Revolver matures in full in 2018.  The Credit Facility is secured by a first priority pledge of substantially all property and assets of Lumos Networks Operating Company and all material subsidiaries, as guarantors, excluding the RLECs. 

The amended Credit Facility includes various restrictions and conditions, including a maximum leverage ratio of   4.75  :1.00 through   December 31, 2016, 4.50  :1.00 through December 31, 2017,   4.25  :1.00 through December 31, 2018, and   4.00  :1.00 thereafter.  The amended Credit Facility also sets a minimum interest rate coverage ratio of   3.25  :1.00.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s leverage ratio was   3.6  7  :1.00 and its interest coverage ratio was   7.2  8  :1.00.  The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of   September 30, 2016  .   

The Company s effective interest rate on its Credit Facility for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   4.  1  3  %. 

8% Notes due 2022 

On August 6, 2015, the Company issued   $150   million in unsecured promissory notes (the  8% Notes ) to an affiliate of Pamplona Capital Management LLC ( Pamplona ). The net proceeds of the   8%   Notes, after a   $1.5   million purchasers discount and payment of   $7.1   million of closing costs, were used to prepay $40.0 million of the Company s existing Credit Facility with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes, including to fund future growth opportunities. The   8%   Notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of   8.00%   and mature on August 15, 2022.  Interest is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis on August 15, November 15, February 15, and May 15 of each year.  Interest is payable in cash or, at the election of the Company, through the issuance of additional notes or by adding the amount of the accrued interest to the unpaid principal amount of the   8%   Notes outstanding at that time. The   8%   Notes were also issued with   5,500,000   warrants for no additional consideration to purchase shares of the Company s common stock (the  Warrants ). The Company allocated the net proceeds received from the debt issuance to the 8% Notes and the equity-classified Warrants based on the relative fair value of the instruments.  As a result, the Company recognized a total discount on the 8% Notes of   $24.8   million of which   $23.5   million represents the value assigned to the Warrants, and   $1.3   million represents the allocated portion  

16   

Table Of Contents  

of the aforementioned $1.5 million purchasers discount.  The discount on the 8% Notes is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method. See Note 10 for additional details regarding the Warrants. 

In connection with the issuance of the 8% Notes in August 2015 and the Term Loan C financing in January 2015, the Company deferred an additional $  6.0   million and   $0.9   million, respectively, in debt issuance costs.  Total unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 8% Notes and Credit Facility are included in the table above, which amounts are included as a reduction of long-term debt in the condensed consolidated ba  lance sheets in accordance with   ASU     2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . These costs are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method.  Amortization of debt issuance costs   was    $  1.1   million and   $0.  8   million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively  ,    and $  3  .3   million and $  1  .  6   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively  . 

The Company s effective interest rate on the 8% Notes for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   12.55%, which represents the contractual rate adjusted for the aforementioned discount and deferred debt issuance costs. 

Co  B  ank Patronage Credits 

The Company receives patronage credits from CoBank and certain other of the Farm Credit System lending institutions (collectively referred to as  patronage banks ) which are not reflected in the interest rates above.  The patronage banks hold a portion of the credit facility and are cooperative banks that are required to distribute their profits to their members.  Patronage credits are calculated based on the patronage banks  ownership percentage of the credit facility and are received by the Company as either a cash distribution or as equity in the patronage banks.  These credits are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of   operations   as an offset to interest expense.  The Patronage credits were   $0.3   million and   $0.2   million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2  015, respectivel  y  ,   and   $  0.  8     million   and   $1  .  0   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .   

The aggregate maturities of Term Loan A, Term Loan B and Term Loan C under the Credit Facility are $  2.0   million in the remainder of 2016, $  13.0   million in 2017, $  70.  9   million in 2018 and $  256.5   million in 2019. The Revolver under the Credit Facility, under which no borrowings are outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , matures in full in 2018. The 8% Notes mature for   $150.0   million in 2022.   

Capital lease obligations  

In addition to the long-term debt discussed above, the Company has capital leases on vehicles with original lease terms of   four   to   five   years.  The Company also has   a    financing arrangement   classified as a capital lease   related to   a   fiber   indefeasible right of use ( IRU )  , which wa  s entered into in January 2016.    The IRU network capacity arrangement extends through 2035 with payments due monthly.   During   the second quarter   of 2016  , the Company fully satisfied a     financing   obligation   related to a software licensing agreement     entered into during 2013  .    As of   September 30, 2016  , the combined total net present value of the Company s future minimum lease payments is $  8.  0   million and the principal portion of these capital lease obligations is due as follows:  $  0.  2   million in the remainder of 2016, $  0.5   million in 2017, $  0.  5   million in 2018, $  0.4   million in 2019,   $0.4   million in 2020 and $  6.  0   million thereafter.

Table Of Contents  

Cash payments for interest for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   in the table above   are     each   net of   $0.  8   million     of cash received from CoBank for patronage credits (Note   5  ).    The amount of interest capitalized was   $  0.  8   million and   $0.  9   million     for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively  .   

Note 7.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, capital lease obligations (including the current portion), accrued liabilities, the Credit Facility (including the current portion)   and the 8% Notes   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, capital lease obligations and accrued liabilities approximated their fair values at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Marketable securities are recorded in the condensed consolidated balance   sheets at fair value (see Note   3). 

T  he following tables present the placement in the fair value hierarchy of financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

18   

Table Of Contents  

The fair value of   commercial paper  , variable rate demand notes   and   corporate, municipal and U.S. government debt securities are provided by a third-party pricing service and are estimated using pricing models.  The underlying inputs to the pricing models are directly observable from active markets.    However, the pricing models used do entail a certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgments in how the underlying inputs are modeled could result in different estimates of fair value.  As such, the Company classifies these fair value measurements as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.   

The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the components included in the Company s long-term debt,   including the current portion. 

The   respective   fair value  s   of the Credit Facility   and the 8% Notes     were   estimated based on an internal discounted cash flows analysis that schedules out the estimated cash flows for the future debt and interest repayments and applies a discount factor that is adjusted to reflect estimated changes in market conditions and credit factors. 

The Company also has certain non-marketable long-term investments for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value with a total carrying value of   $1.  5   million as of   September 30, 2016   and   $1.2 million     December 31, 2015  , of which   $1.  3   million   and   $1.1   million   represents the Company s investment in CoBank for the respective periods.  This investment is primarily related to patronage distributions of restricted equity and is a required investment related to the portion of t  he Credit Facility held by CoBank.  This investment is carried under the cost method.

Note   9  .  Earnings   (Loss)   per Share 

The Company computes basic earnings   (loss)   per share by dividing net income   (loss)   attributable to Lumos Networks Corp. applicable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  The impact on earnings   (loss)   per share of nonvested restricted shares outstanding that contain a non-forfeitable right to receive dividends on a one-to-one per share ratio to common shares is included in the computation of basic earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.  The Company issues restricted shares from time to time with vesting terms that are based on achievement of certain stock price performance conditions.  These nonvested restricted shares are excluded from the computation of basic and diluted weighted average shares until the period in which the applicable performance or market conditions are attained.  The Company uses the treasury stock method to determine the number of potentially dilutive common shares from stock options and nonvested restricted shares during the period.    T  he computations of basic and diluted earnings   (loss)   per share for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 201  5   are detailed in the following table. 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the denominator for diluted earnings per   share excludes   1,117  ,  585   and   1,016,756     shares, respectively,   related to stock options and nonvested restricted stock which would be antidilutive for each period.        For the     nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the denominator for diluted   loss   per common share   is equivale  nt to the denominator for basic loss per common share because the addition of stock options and unve  sted restricted stock (  1  ,008,939   and   469  ,  5  09  , respectively  ) would be antidilutive for   the   period.   For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the denominator for diluted earnings per common share excludes   83  6  ,149   shares related to stock options and nonvested restricted stock which would be antidilutive   for the period.        The earnings   (loss)     per share calculation  s   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015     also exclude the   5,500,000     outstanding stock warrants described in Note 10 as they would be antidilutive for   each     period. 

Note 10.  Stock Options, Restricted Stock and Stock Warrants

The Company has an Equity and Cash Incentive Plan administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company s board of directors, which permits the grant of long-term incentives to employees and non-employee directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, incentive awards, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum number of shares of common stock available for awards under the Equity and Cash Incentive Plan was   5,500,000     and 920  ,672   securities remained available for issuance under the plan.  Upon the exercise of stock options or upon the grant of restricted stock under   the Equity and Cash Incentive Plan, new common shares are issued or treasury stock is reissued. 

The Company issued   no   stock options and     2  92  ,  8  04     shares of restricted stock under the Equity and Cash Incentive Plan during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .    Restricted shares generally cliff vest on the third anniversary of the grant date for employees and generally cliff vest on the first anniversary of the grant date for non-employee directors.  Some of the outstanding restricted stock awards vest on a graded vesting schedule over a five year period.

The Warrants are fully vested and exercisable and may be net-share settled on a cashless basis only until they expire on August 6, 2022.  A portion of the net proceeds from the 8% Notes issuance was allocated to the equity-classified Warrants based on the relative fair value of the instruments. 

Note   1  1  .  Income Taxes     

Income tax expense     for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     was   $1.0   million   and   $1.7   million, respectively  ,    which represents the federal statutory tax rate applied to pre-tax income   (loss)    and the effects of state income taxes and certain non-deductible charges for each period  .    Income tax expense for the   three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015     was   $1.  8   million and   $6.2   million, respectively.

compensation   and     non-deductible interest on the 8% Notes, which are treated as applicable high yield discount obligations ( AHYDO ) within the meaning of Section 163(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. 

While   management   believes   the Company   has adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than its accrued position.  Accordingly, additional provisions could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or ot  herwise resolved.  In general,   tax year  s    201  3   and thereafter   remain open and subject to federal and state audit examinations.

T  he Company had accounts receivable   from Valley  Net of   $0.4   million   at both   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015  .  The Company also leases and resells capacity from ValleyNet.  The total   lease expense was   $0.  3   million   and   $0.  4   million     for     the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  ,   respectively,     and   $  0  .  9   million for   each of   the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

Note 13. Restructuring Charges 

In January 2016, the Company co  mmenced   an employee reduction-in-force. Restructuring costs, consisting of employee severance and termination benefits, of $1.8 million were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

The Company does not recognize revenue related to such matters until   collection of the claims is reasonably assured  .  In addition to this, the Company periodically disputes access charges that are assessed by other companies with which the Company interconnects and is involved in other disputes and legal and tax proceedings and filings arising from normal business activities.   

T  he Company is involved in routine litigation and disputes in the ordinary course of its business.  While the   results of litigation and disputes are inherently unpredictable  , management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and believes that adequate provision for any probable and estimable losses has been made in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 

The Company has purchase commitments relating to capital   projects   totaling $  2  .  9   million as of   September 30, 2016  , which are expected to be satisfied during   the remainder of   201  6  .

Overview 

Lumos Networks Corp. ( Lumos Networks,  the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) is a fiber-based bandwidth infrastructure and service provider in the Mid-Atlantic region.  We provide services to carrier and enterprise   customers, including healthcare providers, local government agencies, financial institutions and educational institutions, over our   approximately   9  ,  200     route-mile fiber optic network.  Our principal products and services include Multiprotocol Label Switching ( MPLS ) based Ethernet, Metro Ethernet ( Metro E ), Fiber to the Cell site ( FTTC ) wireless backhaul and data transport services, wavelength transport services and IP services.        

Our overall strategy is to transition into a pure-play fiber bandwidth infrastructure company through pursuit of expansion opportunities, both organic and inorganic. To achieve organic growth, our objective is to leverage and expand our fiber assets to capture the growing demand for data and mobility services among our carrier and enterprise customers in our marketplace. Our operating strategy is to (i) leverage our fiber network to expand to new fiber to the cell opportunities; (ii  ) monetize our approximately   9  ,  200   route  -mile fiber optic network by selling bandwidth infrastructure services to new and existing carrier and enterprise customers while maintaining a ratio of approximately 80% of our data revenue from o  n-net traffic;  (iii) use our      expansion      and "edge-out  strategies to expand into new markets and markets adjacent to our existing footprint to increase our addressable market size   and better serve our customers  ; (iv) proactively manage our churn through several initiatives including upgrading existing customers from legacy technologies to carrier Ethernet services and continually improving   the   network and operational performance; (v) focus on managing resources from the declining legacy voice products into our faster growing and more profitable data products; and (vi) execute our success-based investment strategy to maintain our capital efficiency and expand margins. 

Business Segments and Strategy 

Our operating segments generally align with our major product and service offerings and coincide with the way that our chief operating decision makers measure performance and allocate resources.      Our current reportable operating segments are data, residential and small business ( R SB ) and RLEC access.   

Our data segment   provided   60.6%   and   56.2%   of our total   revenue for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively  .  Revenue   for our data segment   increased   8  .  9  %     for   the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared   to the respective period   in 201  5  .    This segment, which includes our enterprise data,   transport     and   FTTC product groups, represents the main growth opportunity and   is   the key focal point of our strategy.  We market and sell these services primarily to carrier     and enterprise customers, including healthcare providers,   state and   local government agencies, financial institutions and educational institutions.    Our data product lines are growing at a pace that significantly exceeds   the decline   in   our legacy product lines  ,   and in   the   aggregate, due to   our focus on on-net customers,   they also provide a   higher gross margin  .  A   significant   majority of our capital expenditures and sales force are dedicated to   increasing   revenue and profit from our data   segment  .  We believe that a balanced split between   enterprise and carrier   revenue results in the most effective capital allocation and resulting profitability.  Our ability to   sustain or accelerate revenue growth in our data segment depends on our ability to obtain and effectively deploy capital to upgrade and expand our fiber network and implement our expansion and edge-out strategies in a timely and disciplined manner, attract new customers and successfully manage churn downwards through customer retention programs, including upgrading existing customers from legacy technologies to carrier Ethernet services.  

The   8  .  9  %   year-over-year growth in our data segment revenues   for 201  6   was achieved primarily through   new long-te  rm FTTC contracts with wireless   carriers deploying   long-term evolution (   LTE   )   services and bandwidth upgrades on existing contracts, improving enterprise penetration within our existing and new markets and providing greater Ethernet bandwidth to enterprise customers. This is   reflected by the addition of   26  7   FTTC sites   and   342   lit buildings   over   the twelve-  month period ended   September 30, 2016  .     Our   marketing and   sales   efforts are   focused on taking advantage of increased carrier bandwidth demand, particularly for long-term FTTC contracts from wireless carriers that are deploying LTE     d  ata services, selling into our expansion and edge out   markets   (with an emphasis on targetin  g large   local   enterprise customers   in our expansion markets of Richmond, VA and Norfolk, VA)  , maximizing the use of our carrier end user distribution channel, connecting our enterprise customers to data centers and improving penetration in existing markets.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   1,29  7     cell towers   and   1,984   buildings connected to our fiber network, including   36   data centers  .  Our FTTC revenue increased   $1.8   million, or   23.4  %  , for the three   months ended   September

30, 2016   and increased   $6.5   million, or   31.4%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     a  s compared to the same period  s   in 201  5   as a result of the growth in connected towers   as well as the addition of second tenants and bandwidth upgrades on existing towers  .    Revenues from our enterprise data products     increased   17.2  %   for the   three months ended   September 30, 2016     and increased   13.4%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     as compared to the respective period  s   in 201  5  . Growth in FTTC and enterprise data revenues was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in our revenue from data transport products, which have been negatively impacted by network grooming as existing customers redesign their networks and upgrade from time division multiplexing ( TDM ) technology to Ethernet   products to improve efficiency.  As we continue to   implement our data growth strategy,   which includes   monetizing our newly expanded   fiber optic network in the key Virginia markets of Richmond and Norfolk, we believe that the effect of churn on legacy product lines will be more than offset by revenues from   carrier Ethernet products,   long-term FTTC contracts and new enterprise customers. 

Our R SB segment   provided   30.6%   and   32.5%   of   revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5, respectively  , and   30.9%   and 33.  4  % for the respective   nine-month     periods  .  This segment includes legacy voice and   IP services products targeted at   our residential and small business customers.  Re  venue decl  ined   approximately   5.9  %   for   the first   nine     months of 201  6   as compared to 201  5   primarily due to the decline in revenues from legacy voice   products. This decline is attributable to voice line loss   resulting from residential wireless substitution, technology changes and product replacement by competitive voice service offerings from cable operators in our markets.   We expect aggregate revenue from these businesses will continue to decline.    

Our RLEC access segment provided   approximately     8.8%   and     9.8%     of   our revenues for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,    respectively  ,    as compared to approximately   11.4%   and 11.2% for the respective periods in 2015  .     This decline is attributable to   voice line loss and   regulatory actions taken to reduce intra-state tariffs by applicable regulatory authorities, principally the FCC and the Virginia SCC.  In 2011, the FCC released an order comprehensively reforming its Universal Service Fund ( USF ) and intercarrier compensation systems.  In the order, the FCC determined that interstate and intrastate access charges, as well as local reciprocal compensation, should be eliminated entirely over time.  These FCC pricing reductions commenced on July 1, 2012 and continue through July 1, 2020.    A   portion of the access revenue previously received by our RLECs from carriers is being recovered through payments from the FCC s  Connect America Fund  ( CAF ) and from increases in charges to end user subscribers in the form of rate increases and the FCC s  Access Recovery Charge .  These new payments and revenues were also effective July 1, 2012.  Our total revenues derived from cost recovery mechanisms  ,   inclu  ding the USF and the CAF, were   $  4.2     million   and $  5  .  4   million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  , respectively  ,     and $  14.3   million and $1  6  .  1   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively  . 

Our   R SB and RLEC   access   segments require limited incremental capital to maintain the underlying assets and deliver reasonably predictable cash flows. Despite declining   revenues  , we expect cash flows from these legacy businesses to continue to significantly contribute to funding the capital investment in our growing data segment.   In parallel  , we   are e  xploring   the possib  le   sep  aration of these assets     to enable us to be in a position to   monetize them   more expediently   through a sale   or some other transaction  , should such an opportunity become available  .   

Our operating income margins   were   17.8%   and     17.0%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5  , respectively  , and   14.2%   and   17.3%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively  . The     slight   increase   in our operating income margins   for the thre  e    month period   was primarily     due     to a  n     increase in operating revenues and lower cost of revenues, partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses an  d depreciation and amortization  .    The decrease in our operating margins for the   nine   month period was   primarily due to increased selling, general and administrative expenses   and depreciation and amortization   and higher restructuring costs as compared to the same period in 2015  , partially offset by lower cost of revenues and an increase in operating revenues  .      Our Contribution Margin ratios, as defined below, were   74.7%   and   73.5%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively  , and 74.5%   an  d    73.6%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively  .    Our Adjusted EBITDA margins, as defined below,   were   46.9%   and   43.7%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015  , respectively  , and   45.9%   and   4  4  .  3  %   for the respective     nine   month periods  .

Depreciation and amortization, including depreciable long-lived property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets where applicable;     

Accretion of asset retirement obligations; and     

Restructuring charges.     

Contribution Margin 

Contribution Margin  ,   as defined by us, is net income   or loss   attributable to Lumos Networks Corp. before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, other (income) expenses, net, employee separation charge  s, restructuring charges, gain or   loss on interest rate swap derivatives,   corporate   general and administrative   costs   (as defined above)  , inclusive of equity-based compensation, acquisition and separation related costs and amortization of actuarial gains or losses   and indirect operating   costs     (as defined above)  . Contribution Margin   ratio   is calculated as Contribution Margin   over   operating revenues. 

Contribution Margin is a non-GAAP financial performance measure.  It should not be considered in isolation, as an alternative to, or more meaningful than measures of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP.  Management believes that Contribution Margin is a   meaningful measure   related to the incremental cash flow delivered by new billings   that   provides relevant and useful information to investors for comparing performance period to period   against peer companies   and for comparing   profitability   of the   Company s   businesses  .   Management utilizes Contribution Margin internally to assess the profitability of the Company   s product   groups   and for capital allocation decision-making.   Management also uses Contribution Margin for budget planning purposes and for   other   strategic planning in  i  tiatives.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure.  It should not be considered in isolation, as an alternative to, or more meaningful than measures of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP.  Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a standard measure of operating performance and liquidity that is commonly reported in the telecommunications and high speed data transport industry and provides relevant and useful information to investors for comparing performance period to period and for comparing financial performance of similar companies.   Management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA internally to assess   business performance, the   ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements, to incur indebtedness if necessary, and to fund continued growth.  Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for budget planning purposes and as factors in the Company s employee compensation programs.

Results of Operations  

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 

Operating revenues increas  ed $  0.8   million, or   1.6  %, from the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to   increases in data revenues of $  2.8   million  , partially offset by     decreases in   RLEC   access   revenues of   $1.3   million   and   decrease  s   in R SB revenues of   $0.7   million.  For the three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , data   revenues represented   60.6%   of our total revenue, compared to   56.2%   for the prior year comparative perio  d.    Operating revenues increased   $2.6   million, or   1.7%  ,   from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to increases in data revenue of   $7.5   million, partially offset by decreases in RLEC access revenues of   $1.9   million and decreases in R SB   revenues   of   $3.0   million.   For further details regarding thes  e revenue fluctuations, see  Operating Revenues  below. 

Operating income   in  creased   $0.6     million from the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to the   three months ended September 30, 2016   due to   the aforementioned $0.8   million increase in   operating   revenue  s   and     a    $0.  9   million decrease in   cost of revenue   and   a decrease in   restructuring charges  , partially offset by   a $  0  .  9   million increase in depreciation   and amortization   and a $0.  6   million     increase in selling, general and administrative expenses  .     Operating income decreased   $4.3   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     c  ompared to the same period in the prior year  primarily as a result of   an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $5.  5   million, an increase   in depreciation   and amortization   of $1.9   million   and   an increase in   restructuring   charges  , partially offset by an increase in gross profit (operating reve  nues less cost of revenue) of $  4.3     million.   For further d  etails regarding these operating expense fluctuations, see  Operating Expenses  section below. 

Net income attributable   to   Lumos Networks decrease  d    $0.3   million from the   three months ended September 30, 2015     to the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  Reflected in these resul  ts was   an increase in   interest expense of   $1  .3 million   and a   $0.2 million   decrease in gain on interest rate swap derivative  s   due to i  t  s    expiration on   December 31, 2015  , partially offset by a   $  0  .  6   million increase in operating income and a decrease in income taxes of   $0.7   million  . 

Net income attributable to Lumos Networks decrea  sed   $8.0   million fr  om the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015     to the     nine months ended September 30, 2016     primarily as a result of the   $4.3   million decrease in operating income and an increase in interest expense of $  8  .  1   million, partially offset by a decrease in income taxes of $  4.5   million.

OPERATING REVENUES  

The following table identifies our external operating revenues by business segment and major product group for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

D  ata.    Data revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increas  ed   $2.8   million, or   9.6%  , over the comparative period in 201  5  , and data revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $7.5   million, or   8.9%  , over the comparative period in 2015  .    The overall increase in data revenues is due to growth in contracts with wireless carriers fo  r FTTC site services and growth in enterprise data revenues  ,   partially offset by churn in data transport revenues due to network grooming activities as described below.     

o 

Enterprise Data     Enterprise data   revenues increased   17.2%     and   13.4%     fo  r the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,    respectively,   as compared to the   respective period  s   in 201  5  .  We   were   connecte  d to   1,984   on-net buildings as of   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   1,642   as of   September 30, 2015  .  Metro Ethernet and dedicated Internet were the primary contributors to revenue growth in this segment, which growth was partially attributable to increased   installation of services   sold   through our carrier end user distribution channel. Growth in   these product lines   was partially offset by declines in private line and other legacy enterprise data products as a result of churn from competitio  n from national carriers and cable operators in our markets and to a lesser extent due to customers upgrading from TDM to Ethernet products.     

o 

Transport     Th  e    10.6% and   11.7%   decrease  s   in   transport revenue for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,     respectively,   as compared to the respective period  s   in 2015  ,   was primarily attributable to   continued   network grooming activities by carriers as TDM technology is replaced by Ethernet.

R SB  .   Revenue from residential and small business   products declined   4.2%   and   5.9%     for the     three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,     respectively,   as compared to the   respective period   in   201  5  .  This decline was primarily driven by decreases in revenue from legacy voice products due to the increasing use of wireless devices and competition from cable operators in our markets as well as our shift in focus to voice over IP (which is included in data segment revenues).  As of   September 30, 2016  , we operated app  roximately   24,299   RLEC telephone access lines and   67,569   competitive voice lines, compared to approximately   25,902   and   76,380   as of   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  This represents a   6.2%   year-over-year decline in RLEC telephone access lines and a  n     11.5%   year-over-year decline in competitive voice lines.  Growth in fiber-to-the-premise products within our IP services product group such as Broadband XL and IP video was   partially   offset by declines in revenue from legacy DSL products.  Our total   video subscribers increased   1.4%   over the last twelve months from   5,760   at   September 30, 2015     to   5,841   at   September 30, 2016  .

The   21.6%     de  crease in RLEC access revenues from the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to the   three months ended September 30, 2016      and the   11.0%   decrease in RLEC access   revenues from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     is the result   of the intrastate access rate reductions mandated by regulatory reform and a step-down   in   the recovery   amounts   of certain intrastate access charges from the FCC s Connect America Fund ( CAF ) discussed in the overview section above   and a decrease in RLEC telephone access lines  .     

OPERATING   EXPENSES  

The following table   identifies   our operating expenses for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

N/M   -    Not     Meaningful 

Cost of Revenue, exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization  .    Cost of r  evenue   decreased   $0.9   million, or   8.4%  , for the     three months ended September 30, 2016     and   $1.7   million, or   5.5%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,    as compared to the same period  s   in the prior year, whi  ch is primarily attributable to the overall decrease in voice access lines, partially offset by increase  d     co  location costs as we expand and enhance our fiber network. 

Selling, General and Administrative  , exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization  .    Selling, general and administrative expenses     increased   $0.6   million, or   2.8%  ,     for the   three months ended September   30, 2016     as   compared to the same period in the prior year   primarily as a r  esult of    increases in   network maintenance and operating costs   in addition to acquisition and separation costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016  .     Selling,   general and administrative expenses     increased   $5.5   million, or     9.4%  , for

the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year    primarily as a result of a   $  4.2   million increase in equity-based compensation due   primarily   to an annual employee bonus paid in the form of immediately vested shares of our common stock and   an increase in network maintenance and operating costs of $2.7 million  , partially offset by a $1.  4   million decrease in salaries, wages and benefits primarily due to   the aforementioned   employee reduction-in-force com  menced   in January 2016   and increased capitalized labor  . 

Depreciation and Amortization.      Depreciati  on and amortization     increased   $  0  .  9   million, or   7.9  %  ,     for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     as compared to   the same period in the prior year due   to     a    $1  .  0       m  illion increase in depreciation costs  , partially   offset   by a decrease in amortization expense   of $  0.  1   million.     Depreciation and amortization   increased   $1.9   million, or   5.5%  ,     for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     as compared to   the same period in the prior year due   to     a    $4.  1    m  illion increase in depreciation costs  , partially   offset   by a decrease in amortization expense o  f    $2.  2   million.    The increase   in depreciation costs is a result of the year-over-year increase in our depreciable base of assets primarily from capital investment in our   fiber   network including infrastructure upgrades and FTTC site installations.  The decrease in amortization cost is attributable to   run off of amortization for   customer intangible assets   under   an accelerated amortization   method based on these assets  estimated patterns of benefit. 

Restructuring Charges.    We   incurred   $  1.8   million in restructuring charges for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016  , which consisted of separation benefits associated with an employee reduction-in-force    t  hat com  menced   in   January 2016   (see Note 13 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements)  . 

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSES) AND INCOME TAXES 

The following table summarizes our other income (expenses) and income taxes for the   three   and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

Interest Expense.    Interest expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   primarily consists of incurred costs associated with our Credit Facility as well as amortization of debt issuance costs   and   interest incurred on the 8% Notes  ,   as well as amortization of   associated   debt discounts and debt issuance costs.    The 8% Notes were issued in August, 2015, therefore the three months ended September 30, 2015 did not include a full quarter of the related expenses.    The year-over-year increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the interest on the 8% Notes   for the full year of 2016  , partially offset by higher interest capitalization due to increased long-term network construction projects and changes in bank patronage credits (see Note 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).

Other Income (Expenses).    Other   income (  expenses  )   primarily consists of   interest income earned on marketable securities for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  .   

Income Tax Expense.    Income tax expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 201  5   was   $1.0   million and   $1.8   million, re  spectively  ,    and   $1.7   million and   $6.2   million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively  ,     which represents the federal statutory tax rate applied to pre-tax income and the effects of state income taxes and certain non-deductible   charges   for each period.   The decrease in income tax expense   and   changes   in   our   effective tax rate were   primarily due to the change  s   in income before taxes   and the effect of certain   permanent book and tax differences.     Our recurring   non-deductible   expenses relate primarily   to the 8% Notes issued in August 2015, which are subject to the AHYDO interest limitation.   O  ther   recurring non-deductible expenses   include   non-cash equity-based compensation.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , our cash flows from operations totaled approximately   $45.  8     million and     $52.0   million, respectively.  Our cash flows from operations are primarily generated by payments received from customers for da  ta and voice communication services and carrier access to our network offset by payments to other carriers, payments to our employees, payments for interest and taxes and payments for other network operating costs and other selling, general and administrative expenses.  We have also generated cash from debt financing activities for the primary purpose of funding investment in our fiber optic network  ,   to facilitate growth and for general working capital requirements.  Our cash on hand and marketable securities, which are generally available for operations and to fund long-term FTTC contracts, may also be used to repay debt obligations or fund other capital expenditures. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $566.7   million in aggregate long-term liabilities, consisting of   $457.1     million in   long-term debt, net   of   $31.0   million in debt discounts and deferred issuance   costs  ,     and   $109.6   million in other long-term liabilities, inclusive of deferred income tax liabilities   of     $91.1   million, pension and other postretirement obligations of   $16.4   million and o  ther long-term liabilities of   $2.1   million.  Our   Credit Facility includes a revolving credit facility of $50 million (the  Revolver ), all of which was available for our working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes as of   September 30, 2016  .   

Mandatory prepayments include an excess cash flow sweep equal to 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as   defined under the Credit Agreement, for each fiscal year commencing in 2013 for so long as the leverage ratio exceeds 3.25:1.00.    

Under the Credit Agreement,   certain of our subsidiaries   are also bound by certain financial covenants.  Noncompliance with any one or more of the debt covenants may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity in the event such noncompliance cannot be cured or should we be unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders of the Credit Facility.   

As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants, a  nd our ratios were as follows: 

On January 2, 2015,   we   entered into a $28 million senior secured incremental term loan facility under the existing Credit Facility   (   Term Loan C   )   and amended certain terms of the Credit Facility   (the  Amended Credit Facility )  .    We     used   the net proceeds from Term Loan C to fund   capital expenditures fo  r customer builds related to   new FTTC site contracts.        Term Loan C will mature in 2019 with quarterly payments of 1% per annum.  The Amended Credit Facility sets a maximum leverage ratio of 4.75:1.00 through December 31, 2016, 4.50:1.00 through December 31, 2017, 4.25:1.00 through December 31, 2018   and 4.00:1.00 thereafter. 

On August   6  , 2015  , we closed on the issuance of unsecured promissory notes in an     aggregate principal amount of   $150 m  illion   (the    8%   Note  s   )   to   an affiliate of   Pamplona Capital Management LLC (   Pamplona   ).   N  et proceeds of the   8%   Note  s  , afte  r payment of closing costs,   were   used to pay off   $40 million   of our existing Credit Facility  ,     with the remainder to be used   for general corporate purposes, including to fund future growth opportunities.   The   8%   Notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 8.00% and mature on August 15, 2022.  Interest is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis on August 15, November 15, February 15 and May 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2015.  Interest is payable in cash or, at our election, through the issuance of additional notes or by adding the amount of the accrued interest to the unpaid principal amount of the   8%   Notes outstanding at that time.     We currently intend to pay the interest in cash.  

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have capital leases on vehicles with original le  ase terms of four to five years and an IRU   network capacity   a  rrangement   that are included in   capital lease obligations as a component of   current portion of long-term   debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016  .    As of   September 30, 2016  , the combined total net present value of   our   future minimum lease payments w  as $  8  .  0   million.

Table Of Contents  

The following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

Operating.      The decrease in cash   flows from operations is primarily due to changes in working capital largely due to timing of payments to vendors and cash collections from customers.  

Investing.    The   change   in cash   used in     investing activities is primarily due to an increase in   proceeds from sale or maturity of marketable securities     of   $  77.2   million, a decrease in purchases of marketable securities of   $  16  .  9     million  ,    a decrease of purchases of property plant and equipment of $  14.8   million, and a decrease in broadband network stimul  u  s grant work of   $2.  6     million, partially offset by a decrease in   cash received from the broadband stimulus grant for reimbursement of qualified expenditures and the corresponding release of restricted funds totaling $  7.7   million.  Capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016     were comprised of (i) $  63.1   million for success-based customer projects, network expansion and infrastructure upgrades, (ii) $  4  .  3     million for network maintenance, (iii) $  2.5   million for information technology and facility related projects, and   less   (iv) $  4.  6   million for   de  creases in inventory on hand for capital projects in the preceding categories.  

We currently expect total capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be approximately $85 million to $95 million, of which, approximately $26 million was spent on network expansion projects, including the completion of our approximate 822 route-mile expansion between Richmond, VA and Norfolk, VA. The remaining planned capital expenditures has been allocated to enterprise and   carrier   installations, data network enhancements to significantly improve our ability to provide carrier Ethernet transport and enterprise customer data services and, to a lesser extent, to fund essential network facility upgrades and fiber-to-the-premise deployments for our R SB segment. Our fiber optic network consists of approximately 9,200 route miles.  Approximately 46% of our fiber network is owned by us and has been accumulated through our capital investment in fiber builds and strategic acquisitions over the past several years wit  h the remaining approximately 54  % of our network under IRU network capacity agreements. 

Financing.    The net cash   used in   financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     consisted   of common stock repurchased   for a total of   $2.  4   million to cover tax withholding obligations on   employee stock awards  ,    the repayment of principal on the Credit Facility and payments under capital lease obligations totaling $  8  .  6   million   and a capital distribution to noncontrolling interests of $0.2 million  , partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $  0  .  6   million  . 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   approximately   $  33  .  2   million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately    $  38.8   million in marketable securities, all of which we consider to be available for current operations due t  o the short-term maturities and/or   liquid nature of the holdings.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,     we had working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of   approximately   $56.7   million.  We expect   that the cash we generate from operations   combined with our cash on hand and   marketable securities     will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future.    Additionally, we have access to the Revolver, which is currently undrawn.   However, if our assumptions prove incorrect or if there are other factors that increase our need for additional liquidity, such as material unanticipated losses, loss of customers or a significant reduction in demand for our services or other factors, or if we are successful in obtaining additional major FTTC contracts or we make acquisitions, we would expect to seek additional sources of funds through refinancing or other means including additional equity financing.  There is no assurance that we could obtain such additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all.    If available, a  dditional equity financing may d  ilute our stockholders   and debt financing may restrict our ability to raise future capital. 

As discussed previously in this Management s Discussion and Analysis, events and actions taken by the FCC are projected to have a significant negative impact on our future cash flows from the RLEC access products, partially offset by the Connect America Fund ( CAF ) payments to us. 

On March 4, 2015, our board of directors   terminated   our quarterly dividend in favor of allocating capital to growth opportunities. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or financing activities with special purpose entities.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the

transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)     -    Deferral of the Effective Date  , which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for public business entities from annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Gross versus Net)   ( ASU 2016-08 )  , which clarifies implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU 2016-10 )  , which clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in ASU 2014-09.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 )  , which addresses narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideration, and completed contracts at transition. Additionally, the amendments in ASU 2016-12 provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers.   We   will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, and ASU 2016-12 as of January 1, 2018.    We have not yet sel  ected a transition method and are   still evaluating the effect t  hat ASU 2014-09 will have on our   consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 820): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02 ).  ASU 2015-02 provides a revised consolidation model for all reporting entities to use in evaluating whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  All legal entities will be subject to reevaluation under this revised consolidation model.  The revised consolidation model, among other things, (i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and (iii) modifies the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs through fee arrangements and related party relationships.  ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after September 1, 2016.  We do not expect the future adoption of ASU 2015-02 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Topic 825): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01 ). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for   public business entities   for     fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted.   We do   not expect the future adoption of ASU 2016-01 to have a material impact on   our   consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ), which will replace most existing lease guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.  ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize most leases, including operating leases, on the consolidated balance sheet of the lessee. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  ASU 2016-02 requires the use of a modified retrospective transition method with elective reliefs.  We are still evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  

In   April 2016  , the FASB issued   ASU 2016-  09  ,    Compensation   Stock Compensation (  Topic   718  ) ( ASU 2016-  09   ), which   simplifies the accounting for s  hare-based payment transactions.       Among other things  ,    ASU   2016-  09     provides for (i) the simplification of accounting presentation of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies, (ii)   an   accounting policy   election regarding forfeitures to use an estimate or account for when incurred,   and   (iii) simplification of cash flow presentation for statutory tax rate withholding.   ASU 2016-  09   is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods b  eginning after December 15, 2016  , with early   adoption permitted.    The transition method required by ASU 2016-09     varies by amendment  .   We are still evalua  ting the effect that ASU 2016-  09   will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes certain forward-looking statements.   Such forward-looking statements reflect, among other things, our current expectations, plans and strategies, and anticipated financial results, all of which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Many of these risks are beyond our ability to control or predict. Because of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Furthermore, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake any obligation to update or review any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to: rapid development and intense competition with   resulting   pricing pressure in the telecommunications and high speed data transport industry; our ability to grow our data business on an organic or inorganic basis in order to offset expected revenue declines in legacy voice and access products; our ability to obtain new carrier contracts or expand services under existing carrier contracts at competitive pricing levels to offset churn and achieve revenue growth from our carrier businesses; our ability to divest our legacy business on a timely basis; our ability to effectively allocate capital and timely implement network expansion p  lans necessary to accommodate   organic growth initiatives; our ability to complete customer installations in a timely manner; adverse economic conditions; operating and financial restrictions imposed by our senior credit facility and our unsecured debt obligations; our cash and capital requirements; our ability to maintain and enhance our network; the potential to experience a high rate of customer turnover; federal and state regulatory fees, requirements and developments; our reliance on certain suppliers and vendors; and other unforeseen difficulties that may occur  . These risks and uncertainties are not intended to represent a complete list of all risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed cautionary statements and risk factors included in our other SEC filings, including our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5  . 

Item 3  . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We are exposed to market risks primarily related to interest rates   on our variable-rate debt obligations  .  We entered into the $425 million Credit Facility on April 30, 2013 and amended the Credit Facility to include Term Loan C for an additional $28 million on January 2, 2015.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,    $  3  4  2  .  4   million was   outstanding under our Credit Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a leverage ratio   of   3.6  7  .00 and   an interest coverage ratio of   7  .  2  8  :1.00,   both   of which are in compliance with our debt covenant requirements.  We have other fixed rate, long-term debt   obligations   in the form of   unsecured notes and   cap  ital leases   totaling   $150.0 million and    $  8  .  0   million  , respe  ctively,   as of   September 30, 2016  . 

At   September 30, 2016  , our financial   assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets included unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately   $  33.2   million, substantially all of which is comprised of deposits in non-interest bearing accounts with financial institutions, and marketable securities of   $  38.8   million,   all of which we consider to be available for current operations due t  o the short-term maturities and/or   liquid nature of the holdings.   Other non-current securities and investments totaled   $1  .  5   mil  lion at   September 30, 2016  . 

As of   September 30, 2016  , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable sec  urities were held in financial institutions, money market mutual funds, municipal bonds, commercial paper     and debt securities.  Although we actively monitor the depository institutions and the performance and quality of our investments, we are exposed to risks resulting from deterioration in the financial condition or failure of financial institutions holding our cash deposits, decisions of our investment advisors and defaults in securities underlying the funds and investments.  In accordance with our Board-approved investment policy we have instructed our investment management firm to prioritize liquidity and safety over investment return in choosing the investment vehicles for cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and they have diversified these investments to the extent practical in an effort to minimize our exposure to any one investment vehicle or financial institutions. 

The following sensitivity analysis indicates the impact at   September 30, 2016  , on the fair value of certain financial instruments, which would be potentially subject to material market risks, assuming a ten percent increase and a ten percent decrease in the levels of our interest rates:

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.    

We are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including litigation involving disputes relating to billings by us to other carriers for access to our network.    While the results of litigation and disputes are inherently unpredictable, w  e do not believe that any pending or threatened litigation of which we are aware will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows   (see Note 14  , Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements)  . 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

In the event the Participant breaches any of the restrictions or provisions set forth in this Article V, the Participant waives and forfeits any and all rights to any payments or benefits under the Plan and agrees to return to the Company the gross amount of any amounts paid previously under the Plan and pay to the Company the value of any benefits delivered previously under the Plan.  This waiver and forfeiture shall be effective even in the event a court refuses to enforce the restrictions or provisions set forth in this Article V.  

5.2      Confidentiality of Trade Secrets and Confidential Information  .    The Participant agrees to keep all of the Company s trade secrets, as defined by the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act (   Trade Secrets   ) confidential for so long as the information continues to constitute a trade secret under applicable law.  The Participant further agrees that, for a period of three (3) years following the cessation of his or her employment, he or she will keep confidential all other confidential information of the Company (   Confidential Information   ), which does not constitute a Trade Secret but which is valuable and related to the business of the Company and the details of which are generally unknown to the public or to competitors of the Company.   Confidential Information  includes, but is not limited to (i) business and employment policies, marketing methods and the targets of those methods, finances, business plans, promotional materials and price lists; (ii) the terms upon which the Company obtains products from its suppliers and sells them to customers; (iii) the nature, origin, composition and development of the Company s products or services; and (iv) the manner in which the Company provides products and services to its customers.  If the Participant is questioned about any Confidential Information or Trade Secrets by anyone (including law enforcement authorities or the media), the Participant will promptly notify the Benefits Department (Attention: Human Resources Department).  

5.3      Non-Disparagement  .  The Participant agrees that he or she will not make any negative, disparaging or unflattering statements about the Company or any of its current or former parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, assigns, agents, employees, plan administrators, representatives, attorneys, insurers, related business entities and benefits plans to  

Exhibit 10.1 

any individual or entity (regardless of whether or not the Participant believes such statements to be true).  This provision shall not apply to any statement made in the context of a regulatory, judicial or administrative proceeding or to any statement required by any legal, regulatory or judicial entity, division or department. 

5.4      Return of Documents  .      The Participant agrees to return all of the Company s property to the Company immediately upon request or termination of the Participant's employment.  Such property includes, but is not limited to, the original and any copy (regardless of the manner in which it is recorded) of all documents provided by the Company to the Participant or which the Participant developed or collected in the scope of his or her employment, as well as all Company-issued equipment, supplies, accessories, keys, access cards, computers, cell phones, Blackberries, pagers, materials, files, or records.  

5.5      Reaffirm Obligations  .      Upon termination of the Participant s employment with the Company, the Participant shall, if requested by the Company, reaffirm in writing Participant's recognition of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of the Company s proprietary information and trade secrets and reaffirm all of the obligations set forth in this Article V.  

5.6      Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation  .    

(a)      While the Participant is employed by the Company, the Participant will not, directly or indirectly, compete with the business conducted by the Company, and the Participant will not, directly or indirectly, provide any services to a Competitor.  

(b)      For a period of twelve (12) months after the Participant s employment with the Company ends for any reason (the    Non-Competition Period   ), the Participant will not compete with the Company by performing or causing to be performed the same or similar types of duties or services that the Participant performed for the Company, during the twenty-four (24) months preceding the Termination Date, for a Competitor of the Company in any capacity whatsoever, directly or indirectly, within any city or county of the continental United States in which, at the time the Participant s employment with the Company ends, the Company provides services or products, offers to provide services or products, or has documented plans to provide or offer to provide services or products within the Non-Competition Period, provided that the Participant has knowledge of those plans at the time the Participant s employment with the Company ends (the    Service Area   ).  The Participant acknowledges and agrees that because of the nature of the Company s business, the nature of the Participant s job responsibilities, and the nature of the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets which the Company has provided the Participant access to, any breach of this provision by the Participant would result in the inevitable disclosure of the Trade Secrets and Confidential Information to the direct competitors of the Company.  

(c)      During the Non-Competition Period, the Participant will not, directly or indirectly, sell, attempt to sell, provide or attempt to provide, any products or services that are the same as or substantially similar to, and competitive with, the products or services provided by the Company as of the Termination Date, to any person or entity who was a Customer or an Actively Sought Prospective Customer of the Company, at the time the Participant s employment with the Company ceased.  

Exhibit 10.1 

(d)      During the Non-Competition Period, the Participant will not, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee of the Company to terminate employment with the Company for the purpose of competing with the Company; hire, or cause to be hired, for any employment by a Competitor, any person who within the preceding twelve (12) month period of hire has been employed by the Company, or assist any other person, firm, or corporation to do any of the acts described in this subsection (d).  

(e)      The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company has a legitimate business interest in preventing the Participant from engaging in activities competitive with the Company as described in this Article V and that any breach of this Article V would constitute a material breach of this Article V.  

(f)      The Company may notify anyone employing the Participant or evidencing an intention to employ the Participant during the Non-Competition Period as to the existence and provisions of this Article V and may provide such person or organization a copy of this Article V.  The Participant agrees that the Participant will provide the Company the identity of any employer the Participant plans to go to work for during the Non-Competition Period along with the Participant s anticipated job title, anticipated job duties with any such employer, and anticipated start date.  The Company will analyze the proposed employment and make a determination as to whether it would violate this Article V. If the Company determines that the proposed employment would not pose an unacceptable threat to its interests, the Company will notify the Participant in writing that it does not object to the employment.  The Participant further agrees to provide a copy of this Article V to anyone who employs the Participant during the Non-Competition Period.  

(g)      The Participant acknowledges and agrees that this Article V is intended to limit the Participant s right to compete only to the extent necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company.  The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Participant will be reasonably able to earn a livelihood without violating the terms of this Article V.  If any of the provisions of this Article V should ever be deemed to exceed the time, geographic area, or activity limitations permitted by applicable law, the Participant agrees that such provisions may be reformed to the maximum time, geographic area and activity limitations permitted by applicable law, and the Participant authorizes a court or other trier of fact having jurisdiction to so reform such provisions.  In the event the Participant breaches any of the restrictions or provisions set forth in this Article V, the Participant waives and forfeits any and all rights to any further benefits under this Plan.  Additionally, in the event the Participant breaches any of the restrictions or provisions set forth in this Article V, the Participant agrees to repay the Company for any of the consideration that the Participant received prior to the breach.  

(h)      For purposes of this Article V, the following definitions will apply:  

(i)       Directly or indirectly    as used in this Plan includes an interest in or participation in a business as an individual, partner, shareholder, owner, director, officer, principal, agent, employee, consultant, trustee, lender of money, or in any other capacity or relation whatsoever. The term includes actions taken on behalf of the Participant or on behalf of any other person.  Directly or indirectly  does not include the ownership of less than five percent

(iii)       Customer    as used in this Plan means any person or entity who purchased products or services from the Company within the twenty-four (24) months preceding the Termination Date, and about whom the Participant obtained information in the course of his or her employment or with whom he or she had contact.

(i)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article V, the Participant will not be considered to have violated any prohibition against competing with the Company by engaging in any of the following activities: (1) being employed or retained by (i) any parent, subsidiary or affiliate organization of any Competitor where that parent, subsidiary or affiliate organization does not itself, and the Participant s employment will not cause the Participant to, compete or attempt to compete with the Company by providing or offering to provide products or services that are the same as or substantially similar to, and competitive with, those offered by the Company as of the Termination Date, within the Service Area or (ii) any Competitor, directly or indirectly, so long as the Participant is not providing products or services within the Service Area that are the same as or substantially similar to, and competitive with, those products or services provided by the Company as of the Termination Date within the Service Area; or (2) selling or attempting to sell products or services so long as the services or products, which the Participant is selling or attempting to sell, are not competitive with the type of services or products provided or offered by the Company or for which the Company had documented plans to provide, offer or supply to such customer at the time of the Participant s cessation of employment.

Exhibit 10.1 

5.7      Remedies  .  The parties hereto agree that the Company would suffer irreparable harm from a breach by the Participant of any of the covenants or agreements contained herein. Therefore, in the event of the actual or threatened breach by the Participant of any of the provisions of this Article V, the Company may, in addition and supplementary to other rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violation of the provisions hereof.  The Participant agrees that if a lawsuit or other proceeding is brought to enforce the terms of this Article V or determine the validity of its terms and the Company prevails, the Company will be entitled to recover from the Participant its reasonable attorneys  fees and court costs.  The Participant agrees that these provisions are reasonable.  

5.8      Post-Employment Assistance  .  So long as it does not unreasonably interfere with any employment or any attempts by the Participant to obtain future employment, the Participant agrees that, although he or she shall not be an employee of the Company, he or she shall provide, for a period of ninety (90) days after the Termination Date, whatever information is requested by the Company and such other lawful assistance as reasonably requested by the Company, to aid it in connection with the continuation of its business.  The Participant further agrees that he or she shall cooperate with the Company in connection with any reasonable and lawful requests made to assist it in any litigation or investigation related to alleged acts or omissions occurring during the Participant s employment by the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall provide reasonable notice of any such requests and shall cooperate with the Participant to ensure that its requests do not unreasonably interfere with the Participant s employment or attempts to obtain future employment.    

ARTICLE VI      PARACHUTE PAYMENTS; SECTION 409A 

6.1      Excise Taxes  .  

(a)      Best After-Tax  .  If any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any other agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement, including without limitation any stock option, stock appreciation right or similar right, or the lapse or termination of any restriction on or the vesting or exercisability of any of the foregoing (a    Payment   ), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999 or to any similar tax imposed by state or local law, or any interest or penalties with respect to such tax (such tax or taxes, together with any such interest and penalties, being hereafter collectively referred to as the    Excise Tax   ), then the benefits payable or provided under this Plan (or other Payments as described above) shall be reduced (but not in excess of the amount of the benefits payable or provided under this Plan) if, and only to the extent that, such reduction will allow the Participant to receive a greater Net After Tax Amount than such Participant would receive absent such reduction.  

(b)      Calculations  .  The Accounting Firm (as defined below) will first determine the amount of any Parachute Payments (as defined below) that are payable to the Participant.  The Accounting Firm also will determine the Net After Tax Amount attributable to  

Exhibit 10.1 

the Participant s total Parachute Payments.  The Accounting Firm will next determine the largest amount of payments that may be made to the Participant without subjecting the Participant to the Excise Tax (the  Capped Payments ).  Thereafter, the Accounting Firm will determine the Net After Tax Amount attributable to the Capped Payments. 

(c)      Adjustments  .  The Participant then will receive the total Parachute Payments or the total Capped Payments, whichever provides the Participant with the higher Net After Tax Amount; however, if the reductions imposed under this Article VI are in excess of the amount of benefits payable or provided under this Plan, then the total Parachute Payments will be adjusted by first reducing, on a pro rata basis, the amount of any noncash or cash benefits under this Plan, then noncash or cash benefits under any other plan, agreement or arrangement, then any cash payments under this Plan and finally any cash payments under any other plan agreement or arrangement.  The Accounting Firm will notify the Participant and the Company if it determines that the Parachute Payments must be reduced and     will send the Participant and the Company a copy of its detailed calculations supporting that determination.  

(d)      Overpayments; Underpayments  .  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Code Sections 280G and 4999 at the time that the Accounting Firm makes its determinations under this Article VI, it is possible that the Participant will have received Parachute Payments or Capped Payments in excess of the amount that should have been paid or distributed (   Overpayments   ), or that additional Parachute Payments or Capped Payments should be paid or distributed to the Participant (   Underpayments   ).  If the Accounting Firm determines, based on either the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Company or the Participant, which assertion the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success or controlling precedent or substantial authority, that an Overpayment has been made, that Overpayment may, at the Participant s discretion, be treated for all purposes as a loan ab initio that the Participant must repay to the Company immediately together with interest at the applicable Federal rate under Code Section 7872; provided, however, that no loan will be deemed to have been made and no amount will be payable by the Participant to the Company unless, and then only to the extent that, the deemed loan and payment would either reduce the amount on which the Participant is subject to tax under Code Section 4999 or generate a refund of tax imposed under Code Section 4999 and the Participant will receive a greater Net After Tax Amount than such Participant would otherwise receive.  If the Accounting Firm determines, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, that an Underpayment has occurred, the Accounting Firm will notify the Participant and the Company of that determination and the amount of that Underpayment will be paid to the Participant promptly by the Company after such determination.  

(e)      Definitions  .  For purposes of this Article VI, the following terms shall have their respective meanings:  

(1)         Accounting Firm    means the independent accounting firm currently engaged by the Company; and  

(2)         Net After Tax Amount    means the amount of any Parachute Payments or Capped Payments, as applicable, net of taxes imposed under Code Sections 1, 3101 (b) and 4999 and any State or local income taxes applicable to the Participant on the date of  

Exhibit 10.1 

payment.  The determination of the Net After Tax Amount shall be made using the highest combined effective rate imposed by the foregoing taxes on income of the same character as the Parachute Payments or Capped Payments, as applicable, in effect on the date of payment. 

(3)         Parachute Payment    means a payment that is described in Code Section 280G(b)(2), determined in accordance with Code Section 280G and the regulations promulgated or proposed thereunder.  

(f)      Fees and Expenses  .  The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by the preceding subsections shall be borne by the Company.  

(g)      Records; Cooperation  .  The Company and the Participant shall each provide the Accounting Firm access to and copies of any books, records and documents in the possession of the Company or the Participant, as the case may be, reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determinations and calculations contemplated by the preceding subsections.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant.  

6.2      Section 409A  .  It is intended that any payment or benefit which the Participant is to be paid or provided in connection with this Plan which is considered to be non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, shall be paid and provided in a manner, and at such time, as complies with, or is exempt from, the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  In connection with effecting such compliance with, or exemption from, Section 409A of the Code, the following shall apply:  

(a)      No Acceleration or Deferral  .  Neither the Participant nor the Company shall take any action to accelerate or delay the payment of any monies and/or provision of any benefits in any matter which would not be in compliance with, or exempt from, Section 409A of the Code.  

(b)      Specified Employee Rule  .  If the Participant is a  specified employee  for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, any payment or provision of benefits in connection with the Participant s separation from service (as determined for purposes of Section 409A of the Code) shall not be made until six (6) months after the Participant s separation from service or, if earlier, the Participant s death (the  409A Deferral Period ) as and to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code.  In the event such payments are otherwise due to be made in installments or periodically during the 409A Deferral Period, the payments which would otherwise have been made in the 409A Deferral Period shall be accumulated and paid in a lump sum as soon as, and within thirty (30) days after, the 409A Deferral Period ends, and the balance of the payments shall be made as otherwise scheduled.  In the event such benefits are required to be deferred, any such benefits may be provided during the 409A Deferral Period at the Participant s expense, and the Participant will have the right to reimbursement from the Company as soon as, and within thirty (30) days after, the 409A Deferral Period ends, and the balance of the benefits shall be provided as otherwise scheduled.  

Exhibit 10.1 

(c)      Separate Payments  .  For purposes of this Plan, all rights to payments and benefits hereunder shall be treated as rights to receive a series of separate payments and benefits to the fullest extent allowed by Section 409A of the Code.  

(d)      Separation from Service  .  For purposes of determining time of (but not entitlement to) the payment or provision of non-qualified deferred compensation under this Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code in connection with the termination of the Participant s employment, termination of employment will be construed to mean a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code where it is reasonably anticipated that the Participant will not perform any further services after that date or that the level of bona fide services that the Participant will perform after that date (whether as an employee or independent contractor) will permanently decrease to no more than twenty percent (20%) of the average level of bona fide services the Participant performed over the immediately preceding thirty-six (36) month period.  

(e)      Specified Employee Identification Date  .  A  specified employee  for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code shall be determined on the basis of the applicable twelve (12)-month period ending on the specified employee identification date designated by the Company consistently for purposes of this Plan and similar agreements or, if no such designation is made, based on the default rules and regulations under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code.  

(f)      No Company Liability  .  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan, Lumos and its Affiliates shall not be liable to the Participant if any payment or benefit which is to be provided pursuant to this Plan and which is non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code otherwise fails to comply with, or be exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  

ARTICLE VII      PLAN ADMINISTRATION 

7.1      Plan Administration  .  Except as otherwise provided herein, the Committee shall administer the Plan.  The Committee shall be the "Named Fiduciary" for purposes of ERISA and shall have the authority to control, interpret and construe the Plan and manage the operations thereof.  Any such interpretation and construction of any provisions of the Plan by the Committee shall be final.  The Committee shall, in addition to the foregoing, exercise such other powers and perform such other duties as it may deem advisable in the administration of the Plan.  The Committee may delegate some (or all) of its authority hereunder to the Benefits Department.  The Committee also may engage agents and obtain other assistance from the Company, including Company counsel.  The Committee shall not be responsible for any action taken or not taken on the advice of legal counsel.  The Committee is given specific authority to allocate and revoke responsibilities among its members or designees.  When the Committee has allocated authority pursuant to the foregoing, the Committee shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of the party to whom such responsibility has been allocated, except to the extent provided by law.  

7.2      Claims Procedures  .  

Exhibit 10.1 

(a)      Initial Claim  .  A claim for benefits under the Plan must be submitted to the Benefits Department.  All claims for benefits under the Plan shall be submitted, in writing, to the Committee on forms prescribed by the Committee and must be signed by the Participant or, in the case of a death benefit, by Participant s Beneficiary or legal representative.  Any Participant or Beneficiary who disputes the amount of his or her entitlement to Plan benefits must file a claim in writing within one hundred eighty (180) days of the event that the Participant or Beneficiary is asserting constitutes an entitlement to such Plan benefits or, if later, within ninety (90) days of the date the payment is due.  Failure by the Participant or Beneficiary to submit such claim within such time periods shall bar the Participant or Beneficiary from any claim for benefits under the Plan as the result of the occurrence of such event or the failure to make such payment.  In no event shall the Participant or other claimant be entitled to challenge a decision of the Committee with respect to a claim unless and until the claims procedures herein have been complied with and exhausted.    

(1)      Notice of Decision  .  Written notice of the disposition of the claim shall be furnished to the claimant within a reasonable period of time, but not later than ninety (90) days after receipt of the claim by the Benefits Department, unless the Benefits Department determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim.  If the Benefits Department determines that an extension is required, written notice (including an explanation of the special circumstances requiring an extension and the date by which the Benefits Department expects to render the benefits determination) shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the original ninety (90) day period.

(b)      Appeal Procedures  .  Every claimant shall have the right to appeal an adverse benefits determination to the Committee (including, but not limited to, whether the Participant's Separation from Service was for Cause).  Such an appeal may be accomplished by a written notice of appeal filed with the Committee within sixty (60) days after receipt by the claimant of written notification of the adverse benefits determination.  Claimants shall have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to the claim for benefits.  Claimants will be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant's  

Exhibit 10.1 

claim for benefits, such relevance to be determined in accordance with Section 7.2(c) (Claims  Procedures   Definition of Relevant) below.  The appeal shall take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. 

(1)      Notice of Decision  .  Notice of a decision on appeal shall be furnished to the claimant within a reasonable period of time, but not later than sixty (60) days after receipt of the appeal by the Committee unless the Committee determines that special circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing if the Committee determines that a hearing is required) require an extension of time for processing the claim.  If the Committee determines that an extension is required, written notice (including an explanation of the special circumstances requiring an extension and the date by which the Committee expects to render the benefits determination) shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the original sixty (60) day period.  In no event shall such extension exceed a period of sixty (60) days from the end of the initial sixty (60) day period.  The notice required by the first sentence of this Section shall be in writing, shall be set forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, in the case of an adverse benefit determination, shall set forth the following:

(D)      An explanation of the claimant's right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on appeal.  

(c)      Definition of Relevant  .  For purposes of this Section, a document, or other information shall be considered "relevant" to the claimant's claim if such document, record or other information:  

(1)      Was relied upon in making the benefit determination;  

(2)      Was submitted, considered or generated in the course of making the benefit determination, without regard to whether such document, record or other information was relied upon in making the benefit determination; or  

(3)      Demonstrates compliance with the administrative processes and safeguards required pursuant to this Section 7.2 on making the benefit determination.  

(d)      Disability  .  Notwithstanding the claims procedures above, the following claims procedures shall apply for any claim based on a Disability.  

Exhibit 10.1 

(1)      If a Participant applies for a benefit under the Plan based on a Disability, and in the event a claim for benefits is wholly or partially denied by the Benefits Department, the Benefits Department shall, within a reasonable period of time, but no later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the claim, notify the claimant in writing of the denial of the claim.  This forty-five (45) day period may be extended up to thirty (30) days if such an extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of the Plan, and the claimant is notified, prior to the expiration of the initial forty-five (45) day period, of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Benefits Department expects to render a decision.  If, prior to the end of the first thirty (30) day extension period, the Benefits Department determines that, due to matters beyond the control of the Plan, a decision cannot be rendered within that extension period, the period for making the determination may be extended for up to an additional thirty (30) days, provided that the Benefits Department notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the first thirty (30) days extension period, of the circumstances requiring the extension and the date as of which the Benefits Department expects to render a decision.  In the case of any extension, the notice of extension also shall specifically explain the standards on which entitlement to a benefit upon Disability is based, the unresolved issues that prevent a decision on the claim, and the additional information needed to resolve those issues, and the claimant shall be afforded at least forty-five (45) days within which to provide the specified information, if any.  

(2)      If the Benefits Department denies the claim for a Disability benefit in whole or in part, the claimant shall be provided with written notice of the denial stating the specific reason for the denial; reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the denial is based; a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and a description of the Plan s review procedures (as set forth below) and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including the claimant s right to bring civil action following an adverse benefit determination.  If an internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion was relied upon in making the adverse determination, either the specific rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion shall be provided to the claimant free of charge, or the claimant shall be informed that such rule, guideline, protocol, or other criterion shall be provided free of charge upon request.  

(3)      If the claim for a Disability benefit is denied in full or in part, the claimant shall have the right to appeal the decision by sending a written request for review to the Committee within one hundred eighty (180) days of his receipt of the claim denial notification.  The claimant may submit written comments, documents, records, and other information relating to his or her claim for benefits.  Upon request, the claimant shall be provided free of charge and reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to his claim.  

(4)      Upon receipt of the claimant s appeal of the denial of his claim, the Committee shall conduct a review that takes into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the claimant or his authorized representative relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.  The review shall not afford deference to the initial benefit determination and shall be conducted by an individual who is neither the individual who made the adverse benefit determination that is the subject of the appeal, nor the subordinate of such individual.  The  

Exhibit 10.1 

Committee shall consult a medical professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine relating to the claimant s disability and who is neither consulted as part of the initial denial nor is the subordinate to such individual and shall identify the medical or vocational experts whose advice is obtained with respect to the initial benefit denial, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon in making the decisions.  If a claim is denied due a medical judgment, the Committee will consult with a healthcare professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the medical judgment. The healthcare professional consulted will not be the same person consulted in connection with the initial benefit decision (nor be the subordinate of that person).  The decision on review also will identify any medical or vocational experts who advised the Company s benefits department in connection with the original benefit decision, even if the advice was not relied upon in making the decision. 

(5)      The Committee shall notify the claimant of its determination on review within a reasonable period of time, but generally not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the request for review, unless the Committee determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim.  If the Committee determines that an extension of time for processing is required, written notice of the extension will be furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the initial forty-five (45) day period.  In no event shall such extension exceed a period of forty-five (45) days from the end of the initial period.  The extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring extension of time and the date by which the Plan Administrative Committee expects to render the determination on review.  

(6)      If the Committee denies the claim on appeal, it shall notify the claimant in a manner to be understood by him of the specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination; reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the adverse determination is based; a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to his claim; and a statement indicating the claimant s right to file a lawsuit upon completion of the claims procedure process.  If an internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion was relied upon in making the adverse determination, either the specific rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion shall be provided free of charge, or the claimant may be informed that such rule, guideline, protocol, or other criterion shall be provided free of charge upon request.    

(e)      Decisions Final; Procedures Mandatory  .  To the extent permitted by law, a decision on review or appeal shall be binding and conclusive upon all persons whomsoever.  To the extent permitted by law, completion of the claims procedures described in this Section shall be a mandatory precondition that must be complied with prior to commencement of a legal or equitable action in connection with the Plan by a person claiming rights under the Plan.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, waive these procedures as a mandatory precondition to such an action.  

(f)      Time For Filing Legal Or Equitable Action  .  Any legal or equitable action filed in connection with the Plan by a person claiming rights under the Plan must be commenced not later than the earlier of: (1) the shortest applicable statute of limitations provided by law; or (2) one (1) year of the date the written copy of the Committee's decision on review is delivered to the claimant in accordance with Section 7.2(b) or (d).  

Exhibit 10.1 

ARTICLE VIII      BINDING AGREEMENT 

8.1      General  .  Subject to the right of the Company to amend or terminate the Plan, and the Committee's right to interpret the Plan, the Plan shall be for the benefit of and be enforceable by, a Participant's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If a Participant should die after satisfying the requirements for the receipt of benefits hereunder, any amount remaining unpaid to him or her, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the Plan to the Participant's spouse or, if there is no such spouse, to the Participant's estate.  

ARTICLE IX      NOTICE  

9.1      General  .  For the purpose of the Plan, and except as specifically set forth herein, notices and all other communications provided for in the Plan shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when hand-delivered or mailed by United States certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the Participant at his or her last known address, and to Lumos at Lumos Networks Operating Company, 1 Lumos Plaza, Waynesboro, Virginia 22980, provided that all notices to the Company shall be directed to the attention of the Benefits Department (Attention: Human Resources Department); or to such other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notice of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.  

ARTICLE X      AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 

10.1      General  .  The Plan may be amended, in whole or in part, or terminated at any time, by the Board or the Compensation Committee subject to the following exceptions:  

(a)      No amendment or termination of the Plan shall impair or abridge the obligations of the Company that have become vested and payable as the result of the previous termination of the Participant's employment.  

(b)      No amendment or termination of the Plan shall affect the rights of a Participant who received a Notice of Termination before the effective date of such amendment.  

(c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan may be amended at will at any time and from time to time by the Board to reflect changes necessary due to revisions to, or interpretations of: (1) ERISA; (2) the Code; or (3) any other provision of applicable state or federal law.  

(d)      Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, no amendment may be made if it will result in a violation of Section 409A of the Code and any such amendment shall at no time have any legal validity.  

Exhibit 10.1 

(e)      Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Plan may not be amended or terminated during the Change in Control Protection Period in any way that would adversely affect the rights of any Participant under the Plan without the written consent of the affected Participant.    

ARTICLE XI      MISCELLANEOUS 

11.1      Withholding  .  Any payments or benefits provided for hereunder shall be paid or delivered subject to any applicable withholding required under federal, state or local law.  

11.2      No Right of Assignment  .  Neither a Participant nor any person taking on behalf of a Participant may anticipate, assign or alienate (either by law or equity) any benefit provided under the Plan and the Company shall not recognize any such anticipation, assignment or alienation.  Furthermore, to the extent permitted by law, a benefit under the Plan is not subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process.  

11.3      No Employment Contract  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, by the execution of the Plan, the Company does not intend to change the employment-at-will relationship with any of its employees.  Instead, the Company retains its absolute right to terminate any employee at any time.  

11.4      Mitigation of Benefits  .  The Participant shall not be required to mitigate the amount of payment provided for in the Plan by seeking other employment or otherwise, and except as set forth in the Plan, the amount of any payment or benefit provided for shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by the Participant as the result of employment by another employer, or by retirement benefits received.  

11.5      Service of Process  .  The Secretary of Lumos shall be the agent for service of process in matters relating to the Plan.  

11.6      ERISA Plan  .  The Plan shall be interpreted as, and is intended to qualify as, a severance pay plan under ERISA, and therefore does not constitute an employee pension benefit plan pursuant to Section 3(2) of ERISA.  

11.7      Compliant Operation and Interpretation  .  This Plan shall be operated in compliance with Section 409A or an exception thereto and each provision of this Plan shall be interpreted, to the extent possible, to comply with Section 409A or to qualify for an exception thereto.   

Exhibit 10.1 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Lumos has caused this Plan document to be executed by its duly authorized representative on this 2nd day of August, 2016.

ERISA Rights Statement 

As participant in this Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA.  ERISA provides that all Plan participants shall be entitled to: 

Exhibit 10.1 

examine, without charge at the Plan Administrator s office and at other specified locations, such as worksites and union halls, all documents governing the Plan, including collective bargaining agreements, and a copy of the latest Annual Report (Form 5500 series), if any, filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration (f/k/a the Pension Welfare Benefits Administration). 

obtain copies of all documents governing the operation of the Plan including collective bargaining agreements and copies of the latest Annual Report (Form 5500 series), if any, and an updated summary plan description, by making a written request to the Plan Administrator and paying a reasonable charge for the copies. 

receive a summary of the Plan s annual financial report.  The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant under the Plan with a copy of this summary annual report. 

In addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan.  The people who operate the Plan, called  fiduciaries  of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in your interest and in the interest of the other Plan participants and beneficiaries. 

No one, including your employer, your union, or any other person may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you, in any way solely to prevent you from getting a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.  If your claim for a benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. 

Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights.  For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest Annual Report from the Plan and do not receive them within thirty (30) days, you may file suit in federal court.  In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the documents and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive them, unless they were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. 

If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.  If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan s money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor or you may file suit in a federal court.  The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees.  If your suit is successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay costs and fees.  If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. 

If you have any questions about the Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator.  If you have any questions about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.  You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.
