Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

(1)    Financial Statements 
    
  The unaudited financial statements included herein have been prepared by Illinois Tool Works Inc. and Subsidiaries (the  Company ). In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for interim periods. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform with current year reporting. 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.     
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for recognizing leasing transactions. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a lease liability and lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a lease term greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position. Subsequent measurement, including presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a financing or operating lease. In addition, several new disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.    
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that includes several changes to simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification of tax benefits in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance will require that the income tax effects associated with the settlement of stock-based awards after adoption of the guidance be recognized through income tax expense rather than directly in equity. The income tax effects related to excess tax benefits will also be presented as an operating cash flow in the statement of cash flows rather than a financing activity for all periods presented. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company classified $25 million and $18 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows which will be presented as an operating cash flow under the new guidance. The expected effect on income tax expense or operating cash flows for stock-based awards settled after adoption of the new guidance will depend on inputs such as the stock price and the number of stock-based awards settled in the period presented.     
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to clarify the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The objective of the new guidance is to reduce the diversity in practice of the presentation and classification of certain transactions. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs rather than when transferred to a third party as required under the current guidance. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption. 

(2)    Income Taxes 
    
  The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax returns are routinely audited by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, German Fiscal Authority, French Fiscal Authority, and Australian Tax Office, and a number of these audits are currently ongoing, which may increase the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. Due to the ongoing audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that within the next   twelve months   the amount of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits may be decreased by approximately   $104 million   related predominantly to various intercompany transactions. The Company has recorded its best estimate of the potential exposure for these issues. 
    
  On February 18, 2014, the Company received a Notice of Deficiency ( NOD ) from the IRS asserting that a non-taxable return of capital received from a subsidiary was a taxable dividend distribution. The NOD assesses additional taxes of   $70 million   for  
  
   7 

the 2006 tax year, plus interest and penalties. In May 2014, the Company petitioned the United States Tax Court to challenge the NOD. The Company's petition was subsequently denied and the case proceeded to court with the trial taking place in the third quarter of 2016. Final decision by the tax court is expected in 2017. Although the court's final decision cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes its position continues to be supportable. Accordingly, no reserve has been recorded related to this matter. 

(3)    Inventories 
    
  Inventories as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

(4)    Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
    
  Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of the net assets of purchased businesses.   The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives. The Company performs an impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, or more frequently if triggering events occur, based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. 
    
  When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company evaluates the goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the relevant reporting unit to the carrying value. The Company uses various Level 2 and Level 3 valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its reporting units, including discounting estimated future cash flows based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit and market multiples of relevant public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. 
    
  The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and brands. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets are determined based on a Level 3 valuation method using a relief-from-royalty income approach derived from internally forecasted revenues of the related products. If the fair value of the trademark or brand is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset.  
    
  The Company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of   2016   and   2015  . The assessment resulted in   no   impairment charges in 2016. In 2015, the Company recorded a   $2 million   indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge related to a brand in the Polymers   Fluids segment which had a fair value of   $24 million   and a carrying value of   $26 million  . 

8 

(5)    Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
    
  Pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

The Company expects to contribute approximately   $73 million   to its pension plans and   $5 million   to its other postretirement plans in   2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , contributions of   $66 million   to pension plans and   $4 million   to other postretirement plans have been made. 

(6)    Debt 
    
  Short-term debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   included commercial paper of   $687 million   and   $498 million  , respectively. In addition, in the first quarter of 2016, the Company reclassified   $649 million   related to the   0.90%   notes due February 25, 2017 from Long-term debt to Short-term debt.  
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a $2.5 billion, five-year line of credit agreement with a termination date of May 9, 2021. This agreement replaced the existing $1.5 billion line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 8, 2017 and $1.0 billion line of credit agreement with a termination date of August 15, 2018. No amount was outstanding under this agreement as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  The approximate fair value and related carrying value of the Company's total long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt presented as short-term debt, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

The approximate fair values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were based on a valuation model, using Level 2 observable inputs which included market rates for comparable instruments for the respective periods. 

9 

(7)    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
    
  The following table summarizes changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments reclassified to income relate to the amortization of actuarial losses and prior service income. Refer to the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note for additional information. 
    
  The Company designated the    1.0 billion   of Euro notes issued in May 2015 and the    1.0 billion   of Euro notes issued in May 2014 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. The carrying values of the Euro notes were   $1.1 billion   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  . Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The unrealized pre-tax gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedge was   $232 million   and   $308 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The ending balance of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   consisted of cumulative translation adjustment losses, net of tax, of $  1.1 billion   and $  1.0 billion  , respectively, and unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefits costs, net of tax, of $  358 million   and $  362 million  , respectively. 

(8)    Segment Information 
    
  The Company has   seven   reportable segments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test   Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers   Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products. See Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information regarding operating revenue and operating income for the Company's segments. 

(9)     Acquisition 
    
  On July 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business ("EF C") from ZF TRW for a purchase price of approximately $  450 million  . EF C had operating revenue of   $117 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 which was reported within the Company s Automotive OEM segment. The acquisition of EF C did not materially affect the Company s results of operations or financial position for any period presented.  
    
  Based on preliminary acquisition accounting, the Company allocated   $236 million   to goodwill and   $95 million   to intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships and technology. The intangible assets are expected to be amortized on a straight-line  
  
   10 

basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from   4   to   19   years. The Company anticipates subsequent acquisition accounting adjustments will change the initial amounts recorded for goodwill and intangible assets, primarily due to the completion of valuations. The allocation of purchase price will be completed as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

INTRODUCTION 
    
  Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the "Company" or "ITW") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 84 divisions in 57 countries and employed approximately 48,000 persons. 
    
  The Company's operations are organized and managed based on similar product offerings and similar end markets, and are reported to senior management as the following seven segments: Automotive OEM; Food Equipment; Test   Measurement and Electronics; Welding; Polymers   Fluids; Construction Products; and Specialty Products. 
    
  Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Company's decentralized operating structure, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management. 

THE ITW BUSINESS MODEL 
    
  The powerful and highly differentiated ITW Business Model is the Company s core source of value creation. This business model is the Company s competitive advantage and defines how ITW creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements: 

ITW s   80/20 management process   is the operating system that is applied in every ITW business. Initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980 s, ITW has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the Company. Through the application of data-driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, ITW focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the  80 ) and eliminates complexity associated with the less profitable opportunities (the  20 ). 80/20 enables ITW businesses to consistently deliver world-class operational excellence in regards to product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance; 

Customer-back innovation   has fueled decades of profitable growth at ITW. The Company s unique innovation approach is built on the insight gathered from the 80/20 management process. Working from the customer back, ITW businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their  80  customers. ITW s innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in  80  markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and then creating unique solutions to address those needs. These customer insights and learnings drive innovation at ITW and have contributed to a portfolio of more than 16,000 granted and pending patents; 

ITW s   decentralized, entrepreneurial culture   allows ITW businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. ITW businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the ITW Business Model to customize their approach in order to best serve their customers. ITW colleagues are clear about what is expected of them with regard to ITW s business model, strategy, and values. This leads to a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers operational excellence adapted to their specific customers and end markets. 
       
  ENTERPRISE STRATEGY 
    
  In 2013, ITW began the process of transitioning the Company onto its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the ITW Business Model. Since then, ITW has made considerable progress, as evidenced by the Company s strong financial performance over the past three years. 
    
  The roots of ITW s Enterprise Strategy began in 2011-2012, when the Company undertook a complete review of its performance. ITW gathered deep insights from its businesses that were delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and defined a strategy to replicate that performance throughout the Company. 
    
  Based on this rigorous and thorough evaluation, ITW determined two paths to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. One, ITW needed to shift the Company's primary growth engine to organic; and two, the Company needed to leverage the ITW Business Model to deliver best-in-class margins and returns. 
  
   12 

Shift the Company s Core Growth Engine to Organic 
    
  In order to pivot to fully focus on organic growth, the Company needed to first accomplish several preparatory steps. These key initiatives were a major focus of the Company in 2012-2015, which included portfolio management, business structure simplification and strategic sourcing. 
    
  The first step, portfolio management, was to construct and maintain a business portfolio capable of delivering consistent above-market organic growth. As part of this initiative to realign the portfolio, ITW exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all ITW businesses. This process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated ITW divisions. 
    
  As a result of this work, ITW s business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential. ITW segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve margins and generate price/cost increases. This was achieved through product line simplification which focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. Most of this initiative is complete and ITW businesses are demonstrating notably improved financial performance; the Company expects the remaining product line simplification work to largely be accomplished in 2016. 
    
  The second step, business structure simplification, was to scale-up ITW s operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and to improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to ITW s ability to drive accelerated organic growth. ITW now has 84 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation. 
    
  With the portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely complete, the Company is now able to shift its focus to preparing for, and accelerating, organic growth. 
    
  As a third preparatory step, ITW is currently in the process of reapplying 80/20 to optimize its newly scaled-up divisions for growth. This process involves first using 80/20 to build a foundation of operational excellence, and then applying 80/20-driven insights to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth. 
    
  Once the business is operationally excellent and has identified the right growth opportunities, the final step is to accelerate organic growth. The process of preparing for accelerated organic growth generally takes 18 to 24 months. 
    
  Based on the financial performance of the divisions that are further along in this process, the Company believes that this framework is capable of delivering above market organic growth in all ITW segments. Many ITW divisions are ready to grow and growing above their respective markets, while the rest of the Company s divisions are at various phases of preparing to grow. ITW management is fully aligned on this plan and very focused on executing it. By the end of 2016, the Company expects approximately 85 percent of its businesses to be ready to grow. 
    
  Leverage the ITW Business Model to Deliver Best-in-Class Margins and Returns 
    
  The Company s work to deliver best-in-class margins and returns is focused on two key areas of ongoing activity. The first is strategic sourcing  ,   where the Company seeks to benefit from its size and scale in procurement processes. Sourcing is now a core strategic and operational capability and this improved competitiveness supports ITW s organic growth framework. The Company s 80/20-enabled sourcing organization has delivered an average of 1 percent reduction in spend each year in 2013-2015 and is on track to do the same in 2016 and 2017. 
    
  The second element of the margins and returns area of focus is to better leverage the full power of the ITW Business Model through a much more consistent and focused approach to 80/20 best practice implementation across the Company. ITW has clearly defined what excellence in the practice of ITW s 80/20 management process looks like and the result is significant opportunity to create meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the Company s improvement in both operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. These 80/20 initiatives can result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.

TERMS USED BY ITW 
    
  Management uses the following terms to describe the financial results of operations of the Company: 

Organic business   - acquired businesses that have been included in the Company's results of operations for more than 12 months on a constant currency basis. 
                
    Operating leverage   - the estimated effect of the organic revenue volume changes on organic operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. 
                
    Price/cost   -     represents the estimated net impact of increases or decreases in the cost of materials used in the Company's products versus changes in the selling price to the Company's customers. 
                
    Product line simplification (PLS)   - focuses businesses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines; in the short-term, PLS may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. In the long-term, PLS is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns. 
       
  Unless otherwise stated, the changes in financial results in the consolidated results of operations and the results of operations by segment represent the current year period versus the comparable period in the prior year. The following discussion of operating results should be read in conjunction with Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  In the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods, the Company delivered strong financial results despite a challenging macro environment and foreign currency translation headwinds. The key driver of the Company's financial performance is the continued successful execution of the ITW Business Model and enterprise initiatives as six of seven segments achieved worldwide organic revenue growth and five of seven segments had operating margin at or above 21% in both respective periods. All seven segments had operating margin at or above 21% for the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  On July 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business ("EF C") from ZF TRW for a purchase price of approximately $  450 million  . EF C had operating revenue of   $117 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016. EF C diluted the Company's operating margins by 80 basis points and 20 basis points in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, due to lower operating margin and acquisition related expenses. The Company expects EF C to be slightly accretive to earnings in the first twelve months, but expects improved performance in later years through the application of the Company's 80/20 business management process. The operating results of EF C are reported within the Company's Automotive OEM segment. The acquisition of EF C did not materially affect the Company's results of operations or financial position for any period presented. Refer to the Acquisitions note in Item 1 - Financial Statements for further information. 
    
  The Company s consolidated results of operations for the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods were as follows: 

14 

Operating revenue increased in the third quarter and year-to-date periods due to an increase in organic and acquisition revenues, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. 
                
    Organic revenue grew 1.6% and 1.2% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as consumer-facing businesses increased 2% and 3% in each respective period, representing approximately 60% of total revenues. Industrial-facing businesses were flat in the third quarter and declined 1% in the year-to-date periods. 
                
    Six of seven segments had worldwide organic revenue growth primarily due to higher end market demand, penetration gains and product innovation in each respective period. Organic revenue declined in the Welding segment in each respective period primarily due to lower capital spending in the industrial end markets and sluggish demand in the oil and gas end market. 
                
    PLS activities associated with the portfolio management component of the Company's Enterprise Strategy reduced organic revenue growth by approximately one percentage point. 
                
    North American organic revenue increased 0.7% in the third quarter. Growth in the Test   Measurement and Electronics, Automotive OEM, Food Equipment and Construction Products segments was partially offset by the decline in the Welding, Specialty Products and Polymers   Fluids segments. In the year-to-date period, North American organic revenue increased 1.0% as growth in six segments was partially offset by a decline in the Welding segment. 
                
    Europe, Middle East and Africa organic revenue increased 3.1% and 2.2% in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, as growth in six segments was partially offset by a decline in the Food Equipment segment in the third quarter and a decline in the Welding segment in the year-to-date period.  
                
    Asia Pacific organic revenue increased 3.8% in the third quarter primarily due to growth in the Automotive OEM, Test   Measurement and Electronics, Construction Products, Specialty Products and Food Equipment segments, partially offset by a decline in the Welding and Polymers   Fluids segments. In the year-to-date period, Asia Pacific organic revenue increased 1.0% primarily due to growth in the Automotive OEM, Construction Products, Specialty Products and Food Equipment segments, partially offset by a decline in the Welding, Polymers   Fluids and Test   Measurement and Electronics segments.  
                
    Operating margin of 23.1% in the third quarter increased 40 basis points primarily driven by the benefit of the Company's enterprise initiatives of 120 basis points, positive operating leverage of 30 basis points and favorable price/cost of 10 basis points, partially offset by the dilutive impact of 80 basis points from the EF C acquisition, additional investment in the business and slightly higher expenses related to certain employee benefits. Operating margin was 22.8% in the year-to-date period, an increase of 120 basis points. The primary driver of the operating margin improvement was the benefit of the Company's enterprise initiatives that contributed 130 basis points. Favorable price/cost and positive operating leverage each contributed 20 basis points and were partially offset by the dilutive impact of 20 basis points from the EF C acquisition, additional investment in the business and slightly higher expenses related to certain employee benefits.  
                
    Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50 increased 7.9% for the third quarter. In the year-to-date period, EPS of $4.25 increased 9.0%.  
                
    Free cash flow was $543 million and $1.4 billion in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively. Refer to the Cash Flow section of Liquidity and Capital Resources for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure. 
                
    The Company repurchased approximately 4.3 million and 14.4 million shares of its common stock in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively, for approximately $500 million and $1.5 billion, respectively.  
                
    The Company increased the quarterly dividend by 18.2% in the third quarter of 2016. Total cash dividends of $195 million and $593 million were paid in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016, respectively. 
                
    Adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital was 23.0% for the third quarter and 22.3% for the year-to-date period, an increase of 140 basis points and 180 basis points, respectively. Refer to the Adjusted After-Tax Return on Average Invested Capital section of Liquidity and Capital Resources for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for recognizing leasing transactions. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a lease liability and lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a lease term greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position. Subsequent measurement, including presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a financing or operating lease. In addition, several new disclosures will be required. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.    
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that includes several changes to simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification of tax benefits in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance will require that the income tax effects associated with the settlement of stock-based awards after adoption of the guidance be recognized through income tax expense rather than directly in equity. The income tax effects related to excess tax benefits will also be presented as an operating cash flow in the statement of cash flows rather than a financing activity for all periods presented. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company classified $25 million and $18 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows which will be presented as an operating cash flow under the new guidance. The expected effect on income tax expense or operating cash flows for stock-based awards settled after adoption of the new guidance will depend on inputs such as the stock price and the number of stock-based awards settled in the period presented.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to clarify the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The objective of the new guidance is to reduce the diversity in practice of the presentation and classification of certain transactions. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs rather than when transferred to a third party as required under the current guidance. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  The Company s primary sources of liquidity are free cash flow and short-term credit facilities. In addition, the Company had   $2.3 billion   of cash on hand at   September 30, 2016   and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. Management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the Company's capital allocation priorities, which include: 

internal investments to support organic growth and sustain core businesses; 
     
   23 

payment of an attractive dividend to shareholders; and 
                
    external investments in selective strategic acquisitions that support organic growth focus, and an active share repurchase program. 
       
  The Company believes that, based on its revenue, operating margin, current free cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary. 

Cash Flow 
    
  The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies  . Summarized cash flow information for the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of   2016   and   2015   was as follows: 

Stock Repurchase Programs 
    
  On August 2, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provided for the buyback of up to   $6.0 billion   of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the  2013 Program ). Under the 2013 Program, the Company repurchased approximately   14.9 million   shares of its common stock at an average price of   $96.84   in the first quarter of 2015. The 2013 Program was completed in the first quarter of 2015. 
    
  On February 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the buyback of up to   $6.0 billion   of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the  2015 Program ). Under the 2015 Program, the Company repurchased approximately   1.6 million   shares of its common stock at an average price of   $97.19   in the first quarter of   2015  , approximately   1.9 million   shares of its common stock at an average price of   $97.19   in the second quarter of   2015  , approximately 2.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $84.45 in the third quarter of   2015  , approximately 5.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $94.07 in the first quarter of 2016, approximately 4.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $104.54 in the second quarter of 2016, and approximately 4.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $116.27 in the third quarter of 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   $3.9   billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2015 Program. 

Adjusted After-Tax Return on Average Invested Capital 
    
  The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations  use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company s financial performance and may be different than the method used  
  
   24 

by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. 
    
  ROIC for the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of   2016   and   2015   was as follows: 

ROIC increased 140 basis points for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   2015   as a result of a 5.5% improvement in after-tax operating income and a 0.6% decrease in adjusted average invested capital. Additionally, ROIC increased 180 basis points for the year-to-date period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   2015   as a result of a 6.9% improvement in after-tax operating income and a 2.1% decrease in adjusted average invested capital. 

25 

Working Capital 
    
  Management uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the Company. Net working capital as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is summarized as follows: 

The decrease in net working capital as of   September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by lower cash and equivalents from share repurchases and increased short-term debt due to current maturities of long-term debt.  
    
  Cash and equivalents totaled approximately   $2.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $3.1 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  , primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries. The reduction in cash on hand was primarily driven by share repurchases. Cash and equivalents held internationally may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash and equivalents balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, used to fund new international acquisitions, or used to repay debt held internationally. In the U.S., the Company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs, which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. The Company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. The Company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the Company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the U.S. 

Debt 
    
  Total debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows:   

Short-term debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   included commercial paper of   $687 million   and   $498 million  , respectively. In addition, in the first quarter of 2016, the Company reclassified   $649 million   related to the   0.90%   notes due February 25, 2017 from Long-term debt to Short-term debt. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a $2.5 billion, five-year line of credit agreement with a termination date of May 9, 2021. This agreement replaced the existing $1.5 billion line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 8, 2017 and $1.0 billion line of credit agreement with a termination date of August 15, 2018. No amount was outstanding under this agreement as of September 30, 2016. 

Total Debt to EBITDA 
    
  The Company uses the ratio of total debt to EBITDA as a measure of its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. The Company believes that total debt to EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company s long term  
  
   26 

financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to EBITDA. EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. The ratio of total debt to EBITDA represents total debt divided by net income before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization and impairment of intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis. 
    
  Total debt to EBITDA for the trailing twelve month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows: 

Stockholders  Equity 
    
  The changes to stockholders  equity during   2016   were as follows:

Item 4   Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chairman   Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President   Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(e)) as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chairman   Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President   Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  In connection with the evaluation by management, including the Company's Chairman   Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President   Chief Financial Officer, no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   were identified that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

Part II   Other Information 

Item 1A - Risk Factors 
    
  The Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. The following is an update to the Company s risk factors and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  The Company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and returns.    Acquisitions, including the Company s acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business on July 1, 2016 from ZF TRW, involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the Company's profitability and returns: 
             
    The acquired business could under-perform relative to the Company s expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the Company s anticipated timetable. 
                
    The acquired business could cause the Company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term. 
                
    Acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results. 
                
    The acquired business could place unanticipated demands on the Company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. 
                
    The Company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the  
     
   28 

acquired business s activities. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase the Company's expenses, adversely affect its financial position or cause noncompliance with its financial reporting obligations. 
             
    As a result of acquisitions, the Company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. If the Company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may recognize charges relating to the impairment of these assets. 
       
  The Company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. Downturns in the markets served by the Company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition. 
    
  The Company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe, including the uncertainty created by the United Kingdom s vote to leave the European Union. Slower economic growth, financial market instability, high unemployment, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets we serve can adversely affect the Company s businesses by reducing demand for the Company's products and services, limiting financing available to the Company's customers, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, and increasing the risk that counterparties to the Company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations. 
    
  The global nature of the Company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. 
    
  The Company currently operates in 57 countries. The risks inherent in the Company's global operations include: 
             
    fluctuation in currency exchange rates; 
                
    limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises; 
                
    price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings; 
                
    transportation delays and interruptions; 
                
    political, social and economic instability and disruptions; 
                
    acts of terrorism; 
                
    government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; 
                
    the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; 
                
    import and export controls; 
                
    labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments; 
                
    the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises; 
                
    difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; 
                
    limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and 
                
    potentially adverse tax consequences. 
       
  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union which may increase certain of the risks and uncertainties described above. The United Kingdom represented approximately 5% of the Company's total consolidated operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. If the Company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition. 

Item 2   Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  On February 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for the repurchase of up to   $6.0 billion   of the Company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the  2015 Program ). As of   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   $3.9   billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2015 Program.
