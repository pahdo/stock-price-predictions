NOTE
1   NATURE OF BUSINESS   

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements of InCapta, Inc. (formerly known as TBC Global News Network,
Inc.), a Nevada corporation ( Company ), have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals and adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the operating results for the respective
periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) were omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
year ending December 31, 2016.  

All
common stock share numbers reflect a 1,000 to 1 reverse split of the Company s common stock effective on September 6, 2007,
a 10,000 to 1 reverse split of the common stock effective on April 9, 2009, a 3,000 to 1 reverse split of the common stock effective
on April 27, 2015, and a 19,000 to 1 reverse split of the common stock effective on August 8, 2016.  

In
November 2008, the Company halted its previous operations of providing online movie rentals (also referred to as a  DVD )
and video game rentals to subscribers through its Internet website, gameznflix.com.  

On
May 7, 2009, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State. This
amendment changed the name of the Company to TBC Global News Network, Inc. This corporate action had previously been approved
by consent of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. As of July 30, 2009, the new trading symbol
for the Company is  TGLN.   

During
the first quarter of 2010, the Company ceased its prior operations of producing video news, business profiles, and television
advertisements.  

On
March 19, 2010, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Sterling Yacht Sales, Inc., and it stockholders, Glenn
W. McMachen, Sr., and Arlene McMachen. However, since the buyers breached this agreement the transaction was rescinded, and therefore
no consolidation is required.  

From
August 2010 until August 2014, the Company did not operate. Upon assuming the positions as a director and officer of the Company
in August 2014, Mr. John Fleming commenced operations of the Company as a consultant and also seeking opportunities for the Company.  

On
August 15, 2014, Mr. McMachen, the Company s sole board member, and chief executive officer, president, and secretary/treasurer
of the Company, appointed John Fleming as a new member of the Company s board of directors. Mr. McMachen then resigned from
all positions with the Company. Mr. Fleming was then appointed as the Company s executive officer, president, and secretary/treasurer.
Mr. Fleming will serve in these positions until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until their successors are duly elected
and have qualified.  

On
April 27, 2015, the Company completed a 3,000 to 1 reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock and on August
8, 2016 completed a 19,000 to 1 reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. All shares and per share information
in the accompanying financial statements has been retroactively restated to reflect these two reverse stock splits.  

On
September 3, 2015, the Company completed an acquisition agreement ( Acquisition Agreement ) under which the Company
acquired all of the equity interests of Stimulating Software, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, the acquisition of all
the common stock of Inner Four, Inc., a Florida corporation, and all of the common and preferred stock of Play Celebrity Games,
Inc., a Delaware corporation.  

Effective
on October 21, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to change its name from  TBC
Global News Network, Inc.  to  InCapta, Inc.   

NOTE
2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial
statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management, which is responsible for
their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles and have been consistently
applied in the preparation of the financial statements.  

Use
of Estimates.   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Because
of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  

Revenue
Recognition.   

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition,  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before
revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company is not a counter party
for trades executed through its trading platform and telephone transaction system and, instead, recognizes revenue to the extent
of the flat-fee commission it receives on each trade processed for its agents and their customers.  

The
Company recognizes revenue using four sources: Media consulting, to online television clients, monthly fees for online cloud television
networks, website store revenue sharing and revenue sharing of membership fees with clients.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents.   

The
Company maintains cash balances in non-interest-bearing accounts that currently do not exceed federally insured limits. For the
purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of nine months or less are considered
to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was cash of $24,292 and $1,790, respectively, and
no cash equivalents.  

Prepaid
Expenses.   

Prepaid
expenses consist primarily of common stock issued to consultants for services that will be performed over the terms of the consulting
agreements not to exceed 12 months. The value of the common stock issued for services was based on the market price of the Company s
common stock at the date of issuance. The common stock issued to consultants is fully vested at the date of issuance. Prepaid
expenses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $0 and $1,384,137, respectively.  

Stock
Subscription Receivable.   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the holder of a stock option exercised this option into 6,500,000 free trading shares
of common stock in exchange for a note payable to the Company in the amount of $975,000, of which $164,105 has been paid. The
remaining balance of $810,895 is recorded as a stock subscription receivable and is presented in the accompanying financials statements
as a contra-equity account.  

Income
Taxes.   

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  ASC 740 requires a company to
use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary
differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences
between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of
enactment.  

Under
ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is  more likely than not  that the tax position would
be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount
of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the  more
likely than not  test, no tax benefit is recorded. The adoption had no effect on the Company s consolidated financial
statements.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets.   

In
accordance with ASC Topic 360,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  long-lived assets
such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets groups to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows,
an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds fair value of the asset
group. At December 31, 2015, the Company evaluated its long-lived assets and determined that they had been impaired and took a
charge to earnings of $4,478,142.  

Net
Loss Per Share.   

Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during
the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock,
including any potential common shares outstanding during the period, when the potential shares are dilutive. Potential common
shares consist primarily of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants to purchase common
stock using the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents;
however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive, as they were during 2016 and 2015. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the number of potential common shares excluded from diluted weighted-average number
of outstanding shares was 0 and 0, respectively.  

Stock-Based
Compensation.   

Options
granted to consultants, independent representatives and other non-employees are accounted for using the fair value method as prescribed
by ASC Topic 718,  Share-Based Payment.   

Derivative
Financial Instruments.   

The
Company evaluates all of its agreements to determine if such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as
embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is
initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in
the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a weighted average
Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates.
The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity,
is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current
or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of
the balance sheet date. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s only derivative financial instrument
were embedded conversion feature associated with convertible debentures due to certain provisions that allow for a change in the
conversion price and a warrant that to contains certain provisions that allow for a change in the exercise price if securities
are issued at a price per share below the exercise price.  

Recent
Pronouncements.   

In
January 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-01 (Subtopic 225-20),  Income Statement
- Extraordinary and Unusual Items.  ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP. As a result,
an entity will no longer be required to segregate extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations, to separately present
an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes
and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary item. However, ASU 2015-01 will still retain the presentation and disclosure
guidance for items that are unusual in nature and occur infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for periods beginning after December
15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial
statements. Early adoption is permitted.  

In
February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. 
ASU 2015-02 provides guidance on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether
they should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization
structures (collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed security transactions). ASU
2015-02 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material
effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is permitted.  

In
September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805) . Topic 805 requires that an acquirer
retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, during the measurement period. To simplify the
accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments
to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount
is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings
of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts,
calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  In addition an entity is required to present
separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount
recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment
to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning
December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-016 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated
financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  The new guidance
requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as non-current
on the balance sheet. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within
those annual periods. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 supersedes the
lease recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840, Leases (FAS 13). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities
arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE
3   CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE, INCLUDING RELATED PARTY   

Convertible
notes payable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of the following:  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $208,766.
Due to the variable conversion price associated with these convertible notes, the Company has determined that the conversion feature
is considered derivative liabilities. The embedded conversion feature was initially calculated to be $339,273, which is recorded
as a derivative liability as of the date of issuance. In addition, for one the convertible notes the Company also issued 26 warrants
with an exercise price of $950 subject to change if securities are issued at a price per share below the exercise price. This
provision results in the warrant being a derivative liability. The derivative liability was first recorded as a debt discount
up to the face amount of the convertible notes of $208,766, with the remainder being charge as a financing cost during the period.
The debt discount is being amortized over the terms of the convertible notes. The Company recognized interest expense of $153,658
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the amortization of the debt discount.  

NOTE
4   SHORT TERM NOTE   

On
March 17, 2015, the Company entered into a promissory note with Peter Lambert for a loan of $25,000 that became due on June 15,
2015. The loan carries an interest at the rate of $55 per day. On June 12, 2015, the parties amended this promissory note so that
the loan was extended and will accrue interest at $55 per day until this note is paid in full. As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, there was $31,124 and $16,136 interest accrued on the loan respectively.  

NOTE
5   DERIVATIVE LIABILITY   

The
convertible notes discussed in Note 3 have a conversion price that is variable based on a percentage of the Company s stock
price which results in this embedded conversion feature being recorded as a derivative liability.  

The
fair value of the derivative liability is recorded and shown separately under current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of
the derivative liability are recorded in the statement of operations under other income (expense).  

The
Company uses a weighted average Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following assumptions to measure the fair value
of derivative liability at September 30, 2016:  

The
following table represents the Company s derivative liability activity for the period ended September 30, 2016:  

NOTE

fee.  

On
March 31, 2015, Mr. Fleming transferred $5,743 of various office equipment and supplies to the Company.  The Company
is carrying the balance due to Mr. Fleming under short-term liabilities and will reimburse Mr. Fleming during the current fiscal

shares of common stock for consulting fees.  

On
September 3, 2015 the Company issued 1,338 restricted shares of common stock for the acquisition of all of the equity interests
of Stimulating Software, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, the acquisition of all the common stock of Inner Four, Inc.,
a Florida corporation, and all of the common and preferred stock of Play Celebrity Games, Inc., a Delaware corporation. 837 of
these shares were issued in the name of Chasin, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (226 shares), Team AJ, LLC, a North
Carolina limited liability company (226 shares), AF Trust Company, a Florida corporation (216 shares), and Kaptiva Group, LLC,
a Florida limited liability company (168 shares). John Acunto controls the voting power and investment power of the shares owned
by each of these companies.  

On
November 16, 2015 the Company issued 37 restricted shares of common stock to Mr. Acunto in payment of certain debts of the Company.  

On
December 14, 2015 the Company issued 1,053 restricted shares of common stock in connection with the September 3, 2015 acquisition

for services rendered and to be rendered to the Company valued at $100,000.  

NOTE
7   GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in the notes to the financial statements, the Company has no established source of revenue. This raises substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for the
Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.  

The
Company s activities to date have been supported by debt and equity financing. It has sustained losses in all previous reporting
periods with an accumulated deficit of $133,401,276 as of September 30, 2016. Management continues to seek funding from its shareholders
and other qualified investors to pursue its business plan. In the alternative, the Company may be amenable to a sale, merger or
other acquisition in the event such transaction is deemed by management to be in the best interests of the shareholders.  

NOTE
8   COMMON STOCK   

On
April 27, 2015, the Company completed a 3,000 to 1 reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock and on August
8, 2016 completed a 19,000 to 1 reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. All shares and per share information
in the accompanying financial statements has been retroactively restated to reflect these two reverse stock splits.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued shares of its common stock as follows:  

1,001
                                         shares of common stock to consultants as compensation for services valued at $3,975,653.
                                         The value was based on the market price of the Company s common stock at the date
                                         of issuance;    

263
                                         shares of common stock for financing costs valued at $10,500. The value was based on
                                         the market price of the Company s common stock at the date of issuance;    

249
                                         shares of common stock for the conversion of 0 shares of preferred stock; and

                                         shares of common stock to Mr. John Fleming as compensation for services rendered valued
                                         at $100,000. The value approximates the value of the services rendered was based on the
                                         par value of the Company s common stock.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

The
following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon, and should
be read in conjunction with, our unaudited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  

Overview.

On
September 3, 2015, the Company completed an Acquisition Agreement under which the Company acquired all of the equity interests
of Stimulating Software, the acquisition of all the common stock of Inner Four, Inc., and all of the common and preferred stock
of Play Celebrity Games, Inc.  

On
June 30, 2016, the Company closed these subsidiaries as the business model did not prove out as projected under the acquisition
agreement.  

The
Company has redirected its efforts toward the cloud television market and has launched two cloud television networks, World Drone
Recreation Aviators (wdra.tv and wdra.club) and Leading Edge Radio Network (leadingedgeradio.tv). Each network develops its own
channel(s) content and works with the Company to ensure that their viewers receive it.   

The
Company continues development of its online movie channel which will feature video on demand and a 24 hour a day streaming internet
TV station providing limited free content and a subscriber based business model along with potential revenue generating video
on demand programming.  

The
online news and video news bureau in association with Leading Edge Radio Network is advancing on schedule and completion is expected
by year-end. Leading Edge Radio TV continues developing a venue for new and experienced radio and TV broadcasters to host their
own programs via Internet TV and radio through Mancuso Martin Productions. Leading Edge Radio Network and Mancuso Martin Productions
continue strategic partnership opportunities involving radio, Internet TV and movies with the Company. The Company has also entered
into discussions with Mancuso Martin Productions for screenplay properties through its production division that include seven
screenplays featuring suspense thrillers, horror, comedy, romance and sports themed movies.  

The
Company has entered into preliminary discussions for the creation of a professional line of golf balls and golf equipment in order
to facilitate long term objectives of the design of a professional line of golf balls, gloves, golf shoes and apparel which will
be sold direct to consumer through a proprietary marketing program, eliminating the need for brick and mortar retailing and keeping
the company overhead low.  

Results
of Operations.    

(a)   
       Total Revenue.    

The
Company had revenue of $3,155 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $28,522 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, a decrease of $25,367 or approximately 89%. The Company had revenue of $35,803 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to $28,522 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $7,281 or approximately 25%. These changes
are due to a change in the operation business of the Company.  

(b)   
       General and Administrative Expenses.    

The
Company had general and administrative expenses of $16,067,625 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $681,679
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $15,385,946. The Company had general and administrative expenses
of $21,749,750 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $752,463 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
an increase of $20,997,287. These increases were mainly due to extra expenses in bringing the Company reporting again, and incurring
consulting expenses (including approximate $16,000,000 that was the charge related to the stock options granted).  

(c)   
       Net Loss.     

The
Company had a net loss of $16,230,174 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $671,922 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $15,558,252. The Company had a net loss of $24,307,922 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $734,827 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $23,573,095. This change was due to
significant general and administrative expenses and acquisition contingency in 2016 compared to a 2015.  

Operating
Activities.   

The
net cash used in operating activities was $187,176 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash provided
by operating activities of $3,654 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $190,830.  This change is
attributed to many changes from period to period, including a large net loss, common stock issued for various items, and write-off
of prepaid consulting fees.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources.   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had total current assets of $33,166 and total current liabilities of $507,812, resulting in
a working capital deficit of $474,646.  The cash and cash equivalents was $24,292 as of September 30, 2016.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $209,678 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $25,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $184,678 or approximately 739%. This increase resulted primarily from proceeds
from stock issuances.  

Whereas
the Company has been successful in the past in raising capital, no assurance can be given that these sources of financing will
continue to be available to it and/or that demand for equity/debt instruments will be sufficient to meet its capital needs, or
that financing will be available on terms favorable to the Company. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern.  

If
funding is insufficient at any time in the future, the Company may not be able to take advantage of business opportunities or
respond to competitive pressures, or may be required to reduce the scope of planned product development and marketing efforts,
any of which could have a negative impact on business and operating results. In addition, insufficient funding may have a material
adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, which could require it to:  

curtail operations significantly;   

sell
                                         significant assets;    

seek
                                         arrangements with strategic partners or other parties that may require the Company to
                                         relinquish significant rights to products, technologies or markets; or    

explore
                                         other strategic alternatives including a merger or sale of the Company.    

To
the extent that the Company raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance
of such securities may result in dilution to existing stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt
securities, these securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such
debt could impose restrictions on the Company s operations. Regardless of whether cash assets prove to be inadequate to
meet the Company s operational needs, the Company may seek to compensate providers of services by issuance of stock in lieu
of cash, which may also result in dilution to existing stockholders.  

Inflation.  

The
impact of inflation on costs and the ability to pass on cost increases to the Company s customers over time is dependent
upon market conditions. The Company is not aware of any inflationary pressures that have had any significant impact on operations
over the past quarter, and the Company does not anticipate that inflationary factors will have a significant impact on future
operations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements.   

The
Company does not maintain off-balance sheet arrangements nor does it participate in non-exchange traded contracts requiring fair
value accounting treatment.  

Critical
Accounting Policies.  

The
SEC has issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60,  Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies 
( FRR 60 ), suggesting companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies.
In FRR 60, the Commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal
of a company s financial condition and operating results, and require management to make its most difficult and subjective
judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition,
the Company s most critical accounting policies include: (a) use of estimates; and (b) net income (loss) per share. The
methods, estimates and judgments the Company uses in applying these most critical accounting policies have a significant impact
on the results the Company reports in its financial statements.  

(a)  
      Use of Estimates.   

The
preparation of financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company
evaluates these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. The Company bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

(b)   
       Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.    

In
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 360,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, 
long-lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of assets groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated
future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds fair
value of the asset group. At December 31, 2015, the Company evaluated its long-lived assets and determined that they had been
impaired and took a charge to earnings of $4,478,142.  

Forward
Looking Statements.   

Information
in this Form 10-Q contains  forward looking statements  within the meaning of Rule 175 of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and Rule 3b-6 of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. When used in this Form 10-Q, the words  expects, 
 anticipates,   believes,   plans,   will  and similar expressions are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. These are statements that relate to future periods and include, but are not limited to,
statements regarding the adequacy of cash, expectations regarding net losses and cash flow, statements regarding growth, the need
for future financing, dependence on personnel, and operating expenses.  

Forward-looking
statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those discussed above as well as the risks set forth above under
 Factors That May Affect Operating Results.  These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. The
Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking
statements contained herein to reflect any change in expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances
on which any such statement is based.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer/principal financial officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of the principal executive officer/principal financial officer, of disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon the evaluation, the principal executive officer/principal
financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance
level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by it in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. In
addition, the principal executive officer/principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including
the principal executive officer/principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Inherent
Limitations of Control Systems.   

Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, will be or have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, and/or by management override of the
control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions;
over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, and/or the degree of compliance with the policies
and procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective internal control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  

There
have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
