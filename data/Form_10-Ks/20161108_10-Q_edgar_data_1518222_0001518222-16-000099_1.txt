CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This   Quarterly R  eport on Form 10-Q contains  forward-looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as  believes,   expects,   may,   should,   seeks,   approximately,   intends,   plans,   estimates,  or  anticipates  or similar expressions that relate to our strategy, plans or intentions. All statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, margins,   revenues,   costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results or to our expectations regarding future industry trends   or regarding resolution of regulatory matters described in this   Quarterly Report     on Form 10-Q   are forward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those that we expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon   certain   assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known   or unknown   factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to us on  , and speak only as of,   the date of this report. 

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, which we refer to as cautionary statements, are discussed in detail in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our   A  nnual    R  eport on Form 10-K   for the year ended December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission   ( SEC  or  Commission )   on   March 9  , 201  6     as updated in Part II, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in   our   Quarterly Report   on Form 10-Q   for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016  .   All forward-looking information in this   Quarterly Report     on Form 10-Q   and subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements.

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The Company 

Bankrate, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Bankrate  or the  Company,   we,   us,   our ) own and operate an Internet-based consumer banking, personal finance and senior care network ( Online Network ). Our flagship websites,   Bankrate.com  ,    CreditCards.com   and   Caring.com   are some of the Internet s leading aggregators of information on more than   300   financial   and senior care   products and services, including mortgages, deposits, credit cards, other personal finance categories   and senior care resources  . Additionally, we provide financial applications and information to a network of distribution partners and through national and state publications. 

We operate the following reportable business segments:  

Banking     we offer information on rates for various types of mortgages, home lending and refinancing. We maintain current rate information for more than   600   local markets, covering all 50 U.S. states. Consumers can customize searches for mortgage rates by loan size, type, maturity, and location through our online portals. We also offer rate information and original editorial content on various deposit products, retirement, taxes and debt management.      

Credit Cards     we present visitors a comprehensive selection of consumer and business credit and prepaid cards, providing detailed information and comparison capabilities and host news and advice on personal finance, credit card and bank policies, as well as tools, calculators and products such as free credit reports and estimates of card benefits.     

Senior Care     we provide helpful caregiving content, a comprehensive online senior living directory for the United States, a local directory covering a wide array of other senior caregiving services and telephone support and advice from trained Family Advisors.     

Other     includes unallocated corporate overhead, the elimination of transactions between segments and   the wind down of   our China operations.      

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bankrate, Inc., and subsidiaries CreditCards.com, Inc. ( CreditCards ), LinkOffers, Inc., CreditCards.com Limited (United Kingdom), Freedom Marketing Limited (United Kingdom), Caring, Inc., Wallaby Financial Inc., Quizzle, LLC, and BR1 Holdings, LLC after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions.  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for the fair statement of our results have been included. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Operating results for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016, for any   future   interim period or for any future year. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K ( 2015 Annual Report ) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on   March 9, 2016  . 

Other than as noted below, there have been no significant changes in the Company s accounting policies from those disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report.

Reclassifications 

During the third quarter 2016, management revised the strategy of its Quizzle reporting unit to focus its technology resources primarily on enhancing the user experience of the products and services provided by the Banking segment through greater personalization, and realigned its management reporting structure by integrating the Quizzle operations into the Banking segment.   All segment results reported for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , and as of December 31, 2015,   have been revised to reflect such change. 

Certain amounts presented for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   reflect reclassifications made to conform to the presentation in our   2015   Annual Report and our current presentation. We revised the calculations of basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for certain adjustments to the prior year presentation. There was no change in the calculated basic net income per share or diluted net income per share in total for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 

In accordance with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU 2015-03,  Imputation of Interest     Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  our senior unsecured notes are presented net of their related deferred financing costs as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 

Our operations in China were previously presented as   a    discontinued operation as we were marketing   them   for sale. During the second quarter 2016 we could not come to terms with the   potential   buyer  s   of the business, negotiations ended and the plan to sell the business was abandoned. It was then determined to start the process of winding down and closing   the operations in China, a process   which  , based on   local require  ments and regulations, is not expected to be completed until 2017  .    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, w  e recorded a  pproximately     $723,000     for the acceleration of amortization and depreciation of   certain intangible and work-in-process assets  , furniture, fixtures and equipment     and other assets based on their estimated remaining future economic life, and   $479,000   as employee severance as the operations wind down. 

Discontinued Operation 

In December 2015, we sold our Insurance business. In accordance with   GAAP  , the results of our Insurance business through the date of sale, December 29, 2015, are presented as   a    discontinued operation, and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income   (Loss)   for all periods presented. The operating results of the Insurance business for 2015 are classified as   a    discontinued operation in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements with the exception of   the   condensed consolidated statements of cash flows which is presented on a consolidated basis. The operating results of the Insurance business are consistently excluded from the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented.   During the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   we incurred expenses and received reimbursements related to our 2015 disposal of our Insurance business, which have been classified as a discontinued operation.   See Note 13     Discontinued Operation for presentation of the results of the discontinued operation of the Insurance   business  .   

New Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently Adopted Pronouncements 

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12,  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Allow a Performance Target to Be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period,  which requires that a performance target that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition that affects the vesting of the award. We adopted ASU 2014-12 on January 1, 2016, as required, and it did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01,  Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items.  This guidance eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item, which required that an entity separately classify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and transactions, on the income statement, net of tax after earnings from continuing operations and disclose applicable income taxes and earnings per share date applicable to the extraordinary item. We adopted ASU 2015-01 on January 1, 2016, as required, and it did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Imputation of Interest Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  This guidance requires that the debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. We adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016, as required. The Company s   $300.0   million senior unsecured notes due 2018 are presented at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 net of deferred financing costs of $  3  .  6   million and $4.9 million, respectively. Deferred financing costs were previously included in other assets in the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents  

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05  Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) Customers Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.  The guidance in this update provide a basis for evaluating whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license and clarification of the treatment of fees paid by the customer if that license is to internal-use software, other than internal-use software or not considered a license. We adopted ASU 2015-05 on January 1, 2016, as required, and it did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-10,  Technical Corrections and Improvements.  This guidance s intention is (i) to clarify the Codification for differences between original guidance and the Codification, (ii) correct unintended application of guidance and correct references, or (iii) streamline, simplify or make minor improvements to the Codification through minor structural changes to headings or minor editing of text to improve the usefulness and understandability, that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice. We adopted ASU 2015-10 on January 1, 2016, as required, and it did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805)     Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.  The intention of this guidance is to simplify the accounting adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in business combinations, as the amendment requires the adjustments to provisional amounts be recorded in the current period that they are identified, which eliminates the need to retrospectively account for those adjustments.   We adopted ASU 2015-16 on January 1, 2016, as required, and it did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Recently Issued Pronouncements, Not Adopted as of   September 30, 2016 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  and in August 2015 issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date.  The standard provides companies with a single model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers that supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The core principle of the model is to recognize revenue when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer, as opposed to recognizing revenue when the risks and rewards transfer to the customer under the existing revenue guidance. The guidance permits companies to either apply the requirements retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We are evaluating the effect that this update will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,  which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements     and related disclosures. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01  Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  This update amends some of the existing guidance related to the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.

NOTE 2   GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

During the third quarter 2016, management revised the strategy of its Quizzle reporting unit to focus its technology resources primarily on enhancing the user experience of the products and services provided by the Banking segment through greater personalization, and realigned its management reporting structure by integrating the Quizzle operations into the Banking segment. Management determined that these changes, along with the performance of initiatives utilizing Quizzle   resources  , represented a triggering event for impairment testing at the Quizzle reporting unit. As a result, we completed Step 1 analysis of goodwill, which indicated that the fair value was lower than the reporting unit s carrying value. In accordance with ASC 350-20-35-18  ,   management elected to make an estimate of the goodwill impairment charge as of September 30, 2016, subject to completing our review and finalizing Step 2 of the analysis during the fourth quarter 2016. The estimate was determined using the income and market approaches,  

12   

Table of Contents  

and was based on a number of factors including the estimated fair value of developed technology, trademarks and customer relationships  ,    as well as relevant market related data. The estimated impairment of goodwill for the Quizzle reporting unit as of September 30, 2016 was   $4.2   million.   S  ubsequent to the estimated impairment charge recorded,   t  he carrying values of Quizzle s goodwill and intangible assets as of September 30, 2016 were   $14.4   million   and   $  8  .  9   million, respectively  .   

During the second quarter 2016,   management noted that the operating results of its Banking   reporting unit   had begun to track below plan, primarily due to macro  economic   trends impacting its deposit and display advertising businesses. This triggering event resulted in impairment testing   as of June 30, 2016. It was concluded that the reporting unit s goodwill was impaired and we recorded a   $25.0   million charge for the impairment of its goodwill, determined using the income and market approaches. The Banking reporting unit was tested for impairment again as of September 30, 2016 and it was concluded that no impairment had occurred. The fair value was greater than the carrying value by less than   1%  .     If Banking does not track to expectations, this could lead to further impairment. 

During the first quarter 2016,   the Company s agreement with a large customer of its Senior Care segment was not renewed  . This triggering event resulted in impairment testing as of February 29, 2016. It was concluded that   no   impairment had occurred. The fair value was greater than the carrying value by approximately   18%  , however, the absolute dollar amount of the Senior Care cushion was small. If Senior Care does not track to expectations for strong growth, this could lead to impairment.    

Management did not identify any   other   circumstances or triggers with   its other   reporting unit  s during the third quarter   that could      more likely than not      reduce the fair value of th  os  e reporting units below the carrying amounts based upon the financial performance in the   third   quarter of 2016. 

During the second quarter 2016, the Company acquired the NextAdvisor business, which is reported in our Credit Cards segment (see Note 11     Acquisitions).  

Goodwill activity for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016 is shown below: 

__________ 

(A)    During the third quarter 2016, management realigned its   management reporting structure by integrating the Quizzle operations into the Banking segment  . Previously, Quizzle was report  ed   within Other. 

(B)    During the third quarter 2016, the Company recorded $  4.2   million for the impairment of goodwill in its Quizzle reporting unit and during the second quarter 2016 recorded $25.0   million   for the impairment of goodwill in its Banking reporting unit. 

Intangible assets consist primarily of   trademarks and domain names,   customer relationships, affiliate relationships and developed technologies. Intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives on   a   straight-line bas  i  s.   The increase in intangible assets during 2016 relates to our acquisition of the NextAdvisor business.  

Intangible assets subject to amortization were as follows as of   September 30, 2016  :

Intangible assets subject to amortization were as follows as of December 31, 2015: 

Amortization expense for the   three and     nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $9.5   million and    $  26.6   million, respectively, and   amortization expense for the   three and     nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   was   $8.8   million   and   $26.1   million, respectively  .   

Future amortization expense for   intangible   assets placed into service on or before   September 30, 2016   is expected to be: 

NOTE 3   EARNINGS   (LOSS)   PER SHARE 

We compute basic earnings   (loss)   per share by dividing net   income (loss)   for the period by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings   (loss)   per share includes the effects of dilutive common stock equivalents, consisting of outstanding stock-based awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation     Stock Compensation, to the extent the effect is not anti-dilutive, using the treasury stock method.

The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings   (loss)   per share: 

As   we   incurred a loss   from continuing operations   for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 201  6  , all outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards and performance stock awards have an anti-dilutive effect and therefore are excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding   for those periods  . Accordingly, basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding are equal for such periods.   The following were   excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their impact would have been anti-dilutive  :

NOTE 4   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY  

The activity in stockholders  equity for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   is shown below: 

In February 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a   $50.0   million share repurchase program. Under the terms of the program, the Company   was authorized to   repurchase up to $50.0 million of its outstanding common stock  , excluding commissions  . Stock repurchases under this program   could   be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of specific repurchases   we  re subject to the requirements of federal securities law, market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors. The program w  as completed in April 2016.     As a result, d  uring the   nine months     ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased approximately   5.6   million sh  ares   under the repurchase program,   for approximatel  y    $50.0   million, plus commission fees.    

NOTE 5   SEGMENTS 

The reportable segments presented below represent the Company s operating segments for which separate financial information is available and utilized on a regular basis by its chief operating decision maker, the Company s chief executive officer, to assess performance and allocate resources. Management evaluates the operating results of each of the Company s operating segments based upon revenue and  Adjusted EBITDA , which we define as income from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization  ;   interest  ;   income taxes  ;   changes in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration  ;   stock-based compensation and other items such as loss on extinguishment of debt, legal settlements, acquisition, disposition and related expenses  ;   restructuring charges  ;     any impairment charges; NextAdvisor contingent payments for the acquisition;   costs related to the Restatement, the Internal Review, the SEC and DOJ investigations and related litigation   and indemnification obligations; purchase accounting adjustments; and our operations in China as we are winding down and ceasing its operations  . The Company s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 

During the third quarter 2016, management revised the strategy of its Quizzle reporting unit to focus its technology resources primarily on enhancing the user experience of the products and services provided by the Banking segment through greater personalization, and realigned its management reporting structure by integrating the Quizzle operations into the Banking segment.   All segment results reported for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been revised to reflect such change.

NOTE 6   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  

Fair value, in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). These valuation techniques may be based upon observable and unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value pursuant to the guidance are as follows: 

18   

Table of Contents  

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, which includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. 

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accrued interest, the assets held in the Rabbi Trust and our Senior Notes   (see Note 10   Debt)  .   

The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable and accrued interest approximate estimated fair value   due to their short term nature  .    The   S  enior   N  otes are considered Level 2 investments and the Company uses market informat  ion in measuring their fair value  . These estimates require considerable judgment in interpreting market data, and changes in assumptions or estimation methods could significantly affect the fair value estimates. 

The following table presents estimated fair value, and related carrying amounts: 

_________ 

In addition, we make recurring fair value measurements of contingent acquisition consideration using Level 3 unobservable inputs. We recognize the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration based on its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition using discounted cash flows  , Monte Carlo simulations or probability weighted-expected return model   and subsequent adjustments to the fair value are due to the passage of time as we approach the payment date or changes to management s estimates of the projected results of the acquired business. In determining the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration, we review current results of the acquired business along with projected results for the remaining earnout period to calculate the expected contingent acquisition consideration to be paid using the agreed upon formula as laid out in the acquisition agreements.   The fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration liability is expected to increase each period with the recognition of change in fair value of contingent consideration resulting from the passage of time at the applicable discount rate as we approach the payment dates of the contingent consideration absent any significant changes in assumptions related to the valuation or the probability of payment.

businesses.   In addition, we consider the cost of debt to be a significant input in the valuation of the fair value of the contingent bonus and continent acquisition consideration. We used   5.5%   percent   as our cost of debt   in the  se   valuation  s as of September 30, 2016.   The fair value calculated as of   September 30, 2016   is subject to sensitivity as it relates to the projected results of the acquired businesses, which are uncertain in nature. Each calculation is based on a     separate formula and results that differ from our projections could impact the fair value significantly.  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded Level 3 additions of $37.0 million for the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration for an acquisition (see Note 11   Acquisitions).   During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we   recorded an expense of   $3.5     million   for   the change in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration  ,    which consist  s   of   an increase   of   $841,000   related to the passage of time   and     an increase   in the fair value due to a change in estimate of   $2.6   million.   As of September 30, 2016, the possible contingent acquisition consideration payouts from our acquisitions range from   zero   to   $164.1   million,   depending on   the   achievement of   certain Adjusted EBITDA targets by the acquired operations. 

The fair value of the contingent bonus   is based on the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA targets, and is tied to the participant     s employment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded an expense of   $  536  ,000   for the change in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration, which consists of an increase related to the passage of time. As of September 30, 2016, the possible contingent bonus payout ranges from   zero   to   $11.7   million, depending on the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA targets. 

NOTE 7   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

The Company s stock-based compensation program is a long-term retention program that is intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for directors, officers and employees in the form of awards of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and performance-based restricted shares or units. Stock unit awards entitle the holder to receive shares of common stock of the Company upon vesting on a one-to-one basis. The Company typically settles stock based awards with treasury shares. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   6.3   million shares were available for future grants of awards under the plan. 

The stock-based compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock and performance stock awards recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income are as follows: 

Stock compensation expense for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   includes   $660,000   and   $1.0   million,   respectively, of expense related to performance  -  based restricted share grants that are classified as a liability until the number of shares is determinable. This amount is included in the performance  -  based restricted share expense discussed below. These grants vest on their determination dates, ratably over   three   years. 

Restricted Stock 

The following table summarizes restricted stock award activity for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  :

21   

Table of Contents  

approximately   $3.7   million and   $11.0   million, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock awards of   $10.1   million, net of forfeitures, which is estimated to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.0   years. 

Restricted Stock Units 

During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , restricted stock units were awarded that vest ratably over a   three   year period following the date of the grant. 

Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $1.6   million and   $  3.1   million, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock units of   $15.9   million, net of forfeitures, which is   expected to be recognized over an estimated   weighted average period of   1.4   years. 

Performance  -  Based Restricted Shares 

Performance  -  based restricted shares activity was as follows for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based shares for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $796,000   and   $1.6   million, r  espectively, and for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   was approximately   $66,000   and   $187,000  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested performance stock awards of   $1.6   million, net of forfeitures, which is   expected to be recognized over an estimated   weighted average period of   1.3   years.  

Performance-  B  ased Restricted Stock Units 

During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , performance-based restricted stock units were awarded that vest based upon a performance factor, which is equal to a measure of the Company s profitability over a   2   year period and multiplied by a total shareholder return factor achieved by the Company relative to a determined peer group, with   50%   vesting on the determination date, which will be   the later of   (i) the date on which the audit of the Company s financial statements for its fiscal year 2017 is completed and (ii) the date on which the final calculation of the relative total shareholder return factor is made by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors; and   50%   on the third anniversary of the grant date.   The granted amount represents the target amount of performance-based restricted stock units to be awarded. The amount awarded is determined based on the Company s financial performance metric, Adjusted EBITDA. The total number of performance-based restricted stock units earned based on the financial performance metric can range from   0%   to   150%   of the target amount. The total shareholder return factor could further adjust the number of performance-based restricted stock units earned by a maximum increase or decrease of   25%  .    Stock-based compensation expense related to the performance-based restricted stock units for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $606,000   and   $1.4     million,   respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested

performance-based restricted stock units of   $4.6   million, net of forfeitures, which is   expected   to be recognized over a  n estimated   weighted average period of   2.0   years. 

The grant date fair value of performance-based restricted stock units incorporates a total-stockholders return metric, which is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the Company s ranking relative to an applicable stock index of peers. The weighted average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the fair value of the Company s performance-based restricted stock unit awards are outlined below. 

Performance-based restricted stock unit activity was as follows for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Stock Options 

Stock option activity was as follows for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  : 

Pursuant to the income tax provisions of ASC 718  Stock Compensation , we follow the  long-haul method  of computing our hypothetical additional paid-in capital, or APIC, pool. Approximately   70,000   stock options vested during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 

The following table summarizes our options outstanding and options currently exercisable  : 

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding in the tables above calculated as the difference between the closing price of Bankrate s common stock on the last trading day of the reporting period (  $8.48   at   September 30, 2016  ) and the exercise price of the stock options multiplied by the number of shares underlying options with an exercise prices less than the closing price on the last

trading day of the reporting period. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $173,000   and   $612,000  , respectively, and for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   was approximately   $300,000   and   $2.7   million, respectively.  

As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $600,000   of total unrecognized compensation costs, net of forfeitures, related to non-vested stock option awards is   expected to be recognized over an estimated   weighted average period of   0.5   years. 

NOTE 8   INCOME TAXES  

We calculate our income tax provision for interim periods based on two components: (i) the estimate of the annual effective tax rate and (ii) the existence of any interim period (i.e., discrete) events. The difference between income tax expense computed at the statutory rate and the reported income tax expense during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     and 2015   is primarily due to a tax charge taken for stock compensation expense, the effect of U.S. state income taxes, and the non-deductibility of a portion of the GAAP goodwill impairment recorded during 2016  . 

Our effective tax rate on continuing operations was     an expense     of   -  14.4%   during the     nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to     an expense   of     40.9%   during the     nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively  . The   chang  e in our effective tax rate during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   is primarily   attributed to a higher charge taken for stock compensation     and the tax non-deductibility of   a portion of   the GAAP goodwill impairment charge   over a loss before income   taxes  . 

We have   approximately   $  5  .  2     million and   $  4  .  0   million   of unrecognized tax benefits at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before   201  1  .   

On March 3, 2016, the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) notified us of an examination into the 2013 and 2014 tax years. 

On March 3, 2016, the NYC Department of Revenue notified us of an examination into the 2013 and 2014 tax years  . 

On March 28,   2016 an assessment was issued for the California Income tax audit for 2013 and 2014 tax years for additional tax due of approximately   $  296,000  . 

On August 25, 2016, the New York State of Taxation and   Finance   notified us of an examination into the 2012, 2013 and 2014 tax years. 

On September 2, 2016, the IRS notified us of an examination into the 2015 tax year. 

We accrued   approximately   $  50  ,000     and   $  6  ,000   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively,   and   $  77  ,000   and   $  25  ,000   during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,   for the payment of interest   and penalties   which   is   recorded as income tax expense. 

During the     nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a  n additional   reserve for uncertain tax position  s   in the amount of   $  1  .1   million.

NOTE 9   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, the Company is party to litigation and regulatory matters and claims. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount or range of the loss can be reasonably estimated.   T  he results of complex proceedings and reviews are difficult to predict and the Company s view of these matters may change in the future as events related thereto unfold.     Except as otherwise stated, we have concluded that we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, including reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts already accrued, for each matter disclosed below. An unfavorable outcome to any legal or regulatory matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company s operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.  

BanxCorp Litigation  

In July 2007, BanxCorp, an online publisher of rate information provided by financial institutions with respect to various financial products, filed suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violations of Federal and New Jersey State antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act. BanxCorp has alleged that it has been injured as a result of monopolistic and otherwise anticompetitive conduct on the part of the Company and is seeking approximately   $180   million in compensatory damages, treble damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. In October 2012, BanxCorp filed a Seventh Amended Complaint, alleging violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, Section 7 of the Clayton Act and parallel provisions of New Jersey antitrust laws, and dropping its claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Discovery closed on December 21, 2012 and both parties filed motions in the first quarter of 2013 seeking summary judgment that are pending before the court. The Company will continue to vigorously defend this lawsuit. The Company cannot presently estimate the amount of loss, if any, that would result from an adverse resolution of this matter.  

Securities Litigation  

In October 2014, a putative class action lawsuit was brought in federal court in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the Company, certain of its current and former officers and directors, and other defendants, which is captioned The City of Los Angeles v. Bankrate, Inc., et al., No. 14-CV-81323-DMM. On November 23, 2015, the District Court dismissed an amended complaint in its entirety without prejudice for failing to adequately plead material misrepresentations or omissions, scienter, or loss causation and damages. On December 8, 2015, Lead Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint alleging that the Company s 2012, 2013, and first half of 2014 financial statements improperly recognized revenues and expenses and therefore were materially false and misleading and caused damages. Plaintiffs sought relief (including damages and rescission or rescissionary damages) under the Securities Act of 1933 based on a March 2014 secondary offering and under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of a proposed class consisting of all persons, other than the defendants, who purchased the Company s securities between August 1, 2012 and October 9, 2014, inclusive. On May 17, 2016, the Company announced a proposed agreement, subject to Court approval, to settle this private securities class action against all defendants. Bankrate would pay a total of   $20   million in cash to a Settlement Fund to resolve all claims asserted on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Bankrate stock between October 27, 2011 and October 9, 2014. The proposed settlement further provides that Bankrate denies all claims of wrongdoing or liability. Preliminary approval of the settlement was granted by the court on August 25, 2016, and notice of the proposed settlement is being given to the class. The Court has scheduled a hearing for February 6, 2017 to determine whether to give the settlement final approval. The Company accrued for the settlement amount as of June 30, 2016. Approximately   $13.8 million   of the settlement fund has been funded from insurance proceeds.  

DOJ Investigation 

A  s previously reported, the DOJ has informed the Company that it is investigating the matters that were the subject of the SEC investigation   settled by the Company in 2015  .     It is not possible to predict when the DOJ investigation will be completed, the final outcome of the investigation, and what if any actions may be taken by the DOJ.

CFPB Investigation 

The Company and certain of its employees have received Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) from the CFPB to produce certain documents and answer questions relating to the Company s quality control process for its online mortgage rate tables. The Company has cooperated in responding to the CIDs. The Company received a communication from the CFPB inviting the Company to respond to the CFPB s identified issues in the form of a Notice of Opportunity to Respond and Advise during which the CFPB identified potential claims it might bring against the Company. The Company has submitted a response that it believes addresses the CFPB s issues with respect to the Company s online mortgage rate tables and its quality control processes. We are unable to predict when the CFPB investigation will be completed or the final outcome of the investigation, and cannot presently estimate the amount of loss, if any, that would result from an adverse resolution of this matter.  

In addition to the above  , we are   also   involved in other litigation and regulatory matters and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business and although we cannot be certain of the outcome of any such litigation or claims, nor the amount of damages and exposure that we could incur, we currently believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and regulatory matters can have an adverse impact on us because of investigative, defense or settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

NOTE 10   DEBT  

Senior Notes 

The Company s   $300.0   million   6.125%   senior unsecured notes due 2018 (the  Senior Notes ) were issued in August 2013.     Interest on the Senior Notes accrues daily on the outstanding principal amount thereof and is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on August 15 and February 15. On or after August 15, 2015, the Company may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a premium that will decrease over time as set forth in Bankrate, Inc. s Indenture, dated as of August 7, 2013 (the  Senior Notes Indenture ).  

With the adoption of ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016, the carrying amount of the Senior Notes is presented net of debt issuance costs for all periods presented.   The carrying amount of the Senior Notes at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, is   $295.1 million   and   $293.3 million  , respectively.  

We amortize original issue discount   and   deferred loan fees related to the Senior Notes, which are included within interest and other expenses  , net   on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement  s   of comprehensive   income   (loss)  .    

Interest expense,   amortization of original issue discounts and   amortizat  ion of deferred financing costs  , related to the Senior Notes   w  ere     as follows: 

The following amounts remain to be amortized as of:    

On March 31  , 2015   and May 11, 2015, as required under the terms of the Company s Senior Notes Indenture, as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture thereto, we made   consent payments of   $354,000   and   $374,000  , respectively, to certain holders of the Senior Notes due to the delay in providing timely financial statements. These payments were recorded as deferred   financing costs   and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Senior Notes. 

Our Senior Notes Indenture and Credit Agreement generally permit us to apply the net cash proceeds of approximately   $130.0   million

Table of Contents  

from the sale of our Insurance business to prepay outstanding debt and/or invest in assets useful to our business, in each case, within 365 days of our receipt of such net cash proceeds (subject, in the case of any investment, to a further 180-day extension under certain circumstances). If we do not apply such net cash proceeds in the manner and within the time period described above and the amount of unapplied net cash proceeds exceeds   $10.0   million, we will be required to offer to purchase a portion of our outstanding Senior Notes using those unapplied net cash proceeds at an offer price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,   up   to but not including, the date of purchase.     As of September 30, 2016, we have approximately $34.  2   million of unused net cash proceeds from the sale of our Insurance business. 

Revolving Credit Facility 

The   Company   has    a     $70.0   million     r  evolving   c  redit   facility     ( Revolving Credit Facility )  ,    which matures on   May 17, 2018  .   The proceeds can be used for ongoing working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes, including the financing of capital expenditures and acquisitions. 

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (i) an alternate base rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) or (ii) an adjusted LIBO rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility), each calculated in a customary manner, plus applicable margin. The applicable margin is   3.00%   per annum with respect to alternate base rate loans and   2.00%   per annum with respect to adjusted LIBO rate loans. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, we must pay a commitment fee to the Lenders in respect of their average daily unused amount of revolving commitments at a rate that ranges from   0.375%   to   0.50%   per annum depending on our consolidated total leverage ratio. We may voluntarily prepay loans under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty (subject to customary  breakage  fees in the case of Eurodollar rate loans).  

The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default and requires the Company to comply with a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio of   4.00  :1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter only if the aggregate amount (without duplication) of letters of credit (other than letters of credit that are issued and not drawn to the extent such letters of credit are cash collateralized) and loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed, on a pro forma basis,   30%   of the total revolving commitments of all Lenders at such time. We were in compliance with all required covenants as of   September 30, 2016  . 

All obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors and are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by first priority liens on the assets of the Company and the Guarantors.  

As of   September 30, 2016     $  69  .  2   million   was available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility and there were   approximately     $  80  3  ,000     in letters of credit issued against the facility.    

Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility   were   as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   $  5  35  ,000   and   $754,000  , respectively, in deferred loan fees remains to be amortized. 

NOTE 11   ACQUISITIONS    

2016 Acquisition 

On   June 17, 2016  , we completed the acquisition of   certain   assets of Next Advisor, Inc. (  the  Acquired   NextAdvisor   Business   )  ,    a  n   online source of research and reviews of credit cards, personal finance and internet services. This acquisition was made to accelerate our business, broaden our reach and increas  e   ways to engage consumers looking for credit cards. The results of operations of   the Acquired   NextAdvisor   Business   are being reported in our Credit Cards segment and are included in our   condensed   consolidated results from the acquisition date. The acquisition is accounted for as a business combination and the   acquisition   accounting is preliminary and subject to change as third party valuations are   not   finalized.  

The Company paid   $  63.4   million at closing,   recorded   $37.0   million of deferred contingent consideration, and placed   $11.9   million in  to   escrow as   a    deferred   payment   and to serve as recourse for   indemnity obligations  . The deferred payment is recorded in other assets  

27   

Table of Contents  

and will be amortized into compensation expense over the period earned  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,    no   escrow payments have been made   to the seller  .     The purchase price   is subject to customary net working capital adjustments.  

The transaction called for cash consideration as well as a series of contingent payments based on the achievement of Adjusted EBITDA targets.   We have estimated     contingent payments  , which   are classified as purchase consideration if made   or due   to   the   seller and   as   compensation if made to current employees. As part of the purchase price, the Company recorded a $37  .0   million liability   on the date of acquisition   for the   deferred   contingent consideration due to seller based upon the net present value of the Company s estimate of the future payments. Subsequent measurements are made using the same methodology. This fair value measurement represents a Level 3 measurement as it is based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date.     Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration are recorded as changes in fair value     of contingent acquisition consideration  , see Note 6   Fair Value Measurement  .    

We recorded approximately   $  66.  4   million in goodwill, which reflects the adjustments necessary to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed   and   represents the expected future economic benefits from future growth arising from   the Acquired   NextAdvisor   Business   s scale and expertise in driving traffic via sponsored content  ,    benefits   expected from   using that expertise to   driv  e   traffic   to other Bankrate  -  owned   web  sites  ,   future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually ident  ified and separately recognized  . We expect goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes.   The valuations used to determine the preliminary estimated fair value of the intangible assets and the resulting goodwill in the purchase price allocation principally use the discounted cash flow methodology and were made concurrent with the effective date of the acquisition.   Intangible assets including trademark  s and internet domain name  , customer relationships, and the non-compete   covenant   were valued using the   income a  pproach  , and t  he   developed technology was   valued using cost methodology.   Approximately   $  30.  0   million was recorded as intangible assets consisting of   customer relationships for   $22.  2   million,   trademarks and   i  nternet domain name for   $  6.2   million,   non-compete covenant for   $1.  4   million   and developed technology for   $  150,000  .   The current assets and receivables acquired and the current liabilities assumed were valued at cost. 

The following table presents the   September 30, 2016  , preliminary estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:

2015 Acquisitions 

On   April 1, 2015   we acquired Quizzle, LLC and during 2015 we   also   acquired certain assets and assumed certain   liabilities of certain entities  .   These acquisitions had an aggregate purchase price of   $40.3   million, including   $  6.9   million in fair value of   deferred payments and   $2.7   million in fair value of   contingent acquisition consideration.     The acquisitions were accounted for   under purchase accounting   and   were   included in our consolidated results from the acquisition date  s  .    The financial results of the acquired businesses are immaterial individually and in aggregate to our net assets and results of operations.     We recorded   $  21.8   million in goodwill and   $1  9  .  2   million of intangible assets related to these acquisitions with estimated weighted average useful lives of   10   years, consisting of approximately   $11.5   million of developed technology, approximately   $  4.6   million of domain names and approximately   $  3.1   million of customer relationships  . 

During the third quarter 2016, we recorded an estimated impairment charge to the goodwill of our Quizzle reporting unit. See Note 2   Goodwill and Intangible Assets. 

NOTE 12   RESTRUCTURING 

In   2015,   management adopted a restructuring plan with respect to the Company s corporate and   B  anking segment finance operations   to   align   them   with our commitment to implement best practices, enhance internal controls and drive efficiency throughout the finance function  s   by improving processes, separating corporate and business unit functions, and co  -locating finance teams, where appropriate  . During the same period, management also adopted a restructuring plan consisting of certain changes in corporate and business unit leadership in connection with further aligning Company leadership with its strategic initiatives. As part of this process, we formally communicated the termination of employment to   15   employees  , all of whom have been terminated  . The costs associated with these initiatives primarily represent modifications of share based awards, severance, outplacement services and other costs associated with employee terminations, the majority of which have been or are expected to be settled in shares and cash.   As of   September 30, 2016  ,    the restructuring plan has been completed and   we   anticipate   no   further charges under this plan  .   During the   nine months     ended   September 30, 2016  , certain restructuring charges were reversed for payments that would not be made under the plan.   We anticipate that all payments will be finalized by December 31, 2016. 

The following tables summarize the changes to our restructuring-related liabilities and identify the amounts recorded for restructuring expe  nse and corresponding payments:

NOTE 1  3     DISCONTINUED OPERATION 

In December 2015,   we sold our Insurance business. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the results of operations of the Insurance business are classified as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).   During the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we   incurred     a net loss of   $  96  ,000   and $182,000  , respectively, in discontinued operations related to the previous disposal of our former Insurance business. This activity primarily relates to   legal and other post-closing expenses, partially offset by   reimbursements from s  everal   states for previous sales tax remittances.

Item 2.   Management s     Discussion   and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction 

Our Company 

We are a leading online publisher, aggregator and distributor of personal finance content. We provide consumers with proprietary, fully researched, comprehensive, independent and objective personal finance editorial content across multiple vertical categories including mortgages, deposits, credit cards, senior care and other personal finance categories.  

Our sources of revenue include performance-based advertising, lead generation, display advertising, distribution arrangements and traditional media avenues, such as syndication of editorial content and subscriptions.  

Primarily through our   Bankrate.com   brand, we provide consumer inquiries to advertisers that are listed in our mortgage and deposit rate tables and that hyperlink their listings or provide a phone number. Under this arrangement, advertisers pay Bankrate each time a consumer clicks on that advertiser's hyperlink or calls the phone number. All clicks and calls are screened for fraudulent characteristics in accordance with Interactive Advertising Bureau advertising standards and then charged to the customer s account.  

Primarily through our   CreditCards.com   brand, other owned and operated sites, and through our affiliate networks, we provide consumer inquiries to credit card issuers and principally record sales after the credit card issuers approve the consumer s credit application.  

Primarily through our   Caring.com   brand, we provide helpful caregiving content, a comprehensive online directory   of   senior living communit  ies and in-home care providers   for the United States, and telephone support and advice from trained Family Advisors to consumers looking for senior care options as well as thousands of original articles, helpful tools, and the collective wisdom of an involved online community.  

Primarily through our   Quizzle.com   brand, we provide consumers with tools, services and content that includes credit monitoring, identity theft protection, debt management, credit reports and credit scores, budget planning and credit management techniques.  

We provide a variety of digital display advertising formats. Our most common digital display advertisement sizes are leader boards and banners, which are prominently displayed at the top, bottom or side rails of a page. We charge for these advertisements based on the number of times the advertisement is displayed or based on a fixed amount for a campaign. Advertising rates may vary depending upon the product areas targeted, geo-targeting, the quantity of advertisements purchased by an advertiser, and the length of time an advertiser runs an advertisement on our online network. We sell to advertisers targeting a specific audience in a city or state and also to national advertisers targeting the entire country.  

We also derive revenue through the sale of print advertisements and the distribution (or syndication) of our editorial content. 

We operate the following business segments: 

Banking     we offer information on rates for various types of mortgages, home lending and refinancing options, specific to geographic location and covering all 50 states; rate information on various deposit products such as money markets, savings and certificates of deposits; and information on retirement, taxes and debt management. We provide information and allow consumers to shop for personal and auto loans. This segment also provides original articles on topics related to the housing market and loan refinancing; provides online analytic tools to calculate investment values; and provides content on topics such as retirement 401(k) accounts, Social Security, tax deductions and exemptions, auto loans, debt consolidation and credit risk.

Executive Summary 

During 2016  : 

Net income from continuing operations   in  creased by   $5.1 million     to $10.8 million in   the third quarter and decreased   $42 million to a loss of $29.8 million   year-to-date, from the same periods in 2015     

Completed the acquisition of   the NextAdvisor Business  , a leading online source of independent and in-depth research and reviews of credit cards, personal finance and internet services, which will accelerate our business, broaden our reach and increase the number of ways we can engage with consumers looking for credit card information     

Completed the authorized share repurchase program with the repurchase of approximately 5.6 million shares      

Initiated the process of winding down our operations in China after negotiations with potential buyers did not result in a transaction     

During the third quarter, r  evised the strategy of   our   Quizzle reporting unit to focus its technology resources primarily on enhancing the user experience of the products and services provided by the Banking segment through greater personalization, and realigned   our   management reporting structure by integrating the Quizzle operations into the Banking segment  . A    $  4.2   million   estimated   impairment charge   was recorded   for the impairment of goodwill in our Quizzle reporting unit,   primarily   due to the   performance of initiatives utilizing Quizzle   resources     

During the second quarter, recorded a $25.0 million impairment charge to goodwill in our Banking segment as the operating results began to track below plan, primarily due to macroeconomic trends impacting its deposit and display advertising businesses     

Funded    $  6  .  1 million to a settlement fund for the $20.0 million proposed   settlement of the private securities class action lawsuit  ;   approximately   $13.8 million of   the settlement   was funded by   insurance proceeds      

Certain Trends Influencing   Our Business 

Our business benefits from the secular shift toward consumer use of online networks to research and shop for personal finance products coupled with increased consumer interest in comparison shopping for such products, and the related shift in advertiser demand from offline to online and toward the targeting of in-market consumers. Our ability to benefit from these trends depends on the strength of our position in the personal finance services markets driven by our brands, proprietary and aggregated content, breadth and depth of personal finance products, distribution, position in search results and monetization capabilities. The key drivers of our business include the number of in-market consumers visiting our online network  ,   including the number of page views they generate  ; the cost of bringing those consumers to our online network;   the availability of financial products  ;   and the demand of   our online network advertisers  . We believe that increases in housing activity and general consumer financial activity and fluctuations in interest rates positively impact these drivers while decreases in these areas, or a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, could have a negative impact on these drivers. 

Key Initiatives 

We are focused on the following key initiatives to drive our business:

Critical Accounting Policies 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. We base our judgments, estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies or estimates during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K dated   March 9, 2016   and filed with the SEC, except as updated in Note 1 in Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 1 in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Results of Operations 

Our chief operating decision maker manages, assesses performance and allocates resources based upon separate financial information from our operating segments (see Note 5 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). In identifying our reportable segments, we also considered the nature of the services provided by our operating segments and other relevant factors. We aggregate certain of our operating segments into our reportable segments. 

During the third quarter 2016, management revised the strategy of   our   Quizzle reporting unit to focus its technology resources primarily on enhancing the user experience of the products and services provided by the Banking segment through greater personalization, and realigned its management reporting structure by integrating the Quizzle operations into the Banking segment.   All segment results reported for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015   have been revised to reflect such change. 

Management evaluates the operating results of each of our operating segments based upon revenue and  Adjusted EBITDA , which we define as income from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization  ;   interest  ;   income taxes  ;   changes in fair value of conti  ngent acquisition consideration;   stock-based compensation  ;   and other items such as loss on extinguishment of debt, legal settlements, acquisition, disposition and related expenses  ;   restructuring charges  ;   any impairment charge  s;     NextAdvisor contingent payments for the acquisition;   costs related to the Restatement, the Internal Review, the SEC and DOJ investigations and related litigation   and indemnification obligations;   purchase accounting adjustments; and our operations in China as we are winding down and ceasing its operations  . Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.

Of the total revenue decrease, consumer inquiry revenues generated through our rate tables decreased by $  673  ,000 (  3.7  %) due to lower advertiser demand in our deposit vertical compared to the prior year. Overall unit pricing was   20.6  % lower due to our efforts to align the price of each click with the value received by the advertisers, partially offset by a   2  1.  3  % increase in volume due to growth in our mortgage vertical. Other revenue decreased by $  1.8   million primarily driven by a decline in sold advertising impressions.

Credit Cards 

Revenue increased $3  2  .  9   million (  50  .3%) for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with 2015,   of which   $1  4  .  8   million   (45.0%)   of the year over year increase was related to the results of   the NextAdvisor business   which was acquired during the   second   quarter   of 2016  . Of the total revenue growth, consumer inquiry revenues from our owned and operated sites grew by $  27.0   million (  54.1  %), of which approximately   63  % came through higher consumer volume and the remainder came through   better     pricing and sales conversion.   Other revenue, which is largely comprised of revenue generated through third-party affiliates,   increased    $  5  .  9 million, reflecting a positive year-over-year impact from the acquisition of NextAdvisor. 

Adjusted EBITDA   in  creased $  6.4   million (  19.5  %) for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with 2015. Expenses included in Adjusted EBITDA increased $  26.5   million from the prior year period, primarily due to a $  21.6   million increase in cost of revenue, mainly related to increased paid marketing expense   and affiliate revenue share payments  . Sales and marketing expense increased $  97  ,000. Product development and technology cost increased by $1.  6   million primarily due to higher compensation, benefit and incentive compensation expense. General and administrative expenses were $  3.2   million higher, mainly attributed to higher compensation, benefit expense and contract labor and consulting costs. 

Senior Care 

Revenue   de  creased $  771  ,000 (  11.6%  ) for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with 2015.   This was primarily due to a decrease of $372,000 in revenue from senior housing ref  errals which is attributable to decreased spending on lead acquisition which resulted in fewer move-ins from leads we provided to senior living communities, partly offset by higher referral fees generated per   move-in.     Advertising revenue was down $296,000 following a decision to de-emphasize pharmaceutical ad campaigns. Subscription   revenue declined by $196,000 as we converted expiring subscriptions for senior living communities to referral fee agreements and expiring subscriptions for in-home care providers to cost-per-lead arrangements. However, revenue from selling leads to in-home care providers increased by $93,000 as we ramped up this new revenue source. 

Adjusted EBITDA   de  creased $  375  ,000   (62.8%)   primarily due to   decreased   revenue. Expenses included in Adjusted EBITDA decreased $  396  ,000 from the prior year period  . C  ost of revenue decreased by $  748  ,000 primarily due to lower   lead acquisition costs  . Sales and marketing expense was $  169  ,000 higher, primarily attributed to employee compensation, benefits and commissions   and consulting expenses  .

Revenue for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared with 2015 decreased   $540,000, and excluding China decreased    $  273,000  , while Adjusted EBITDA   excluding the China operations, which are being wound down,   decreased $  1.5   million. The revenue decrease is primarily attributed to increased intersegment revenue eliminations. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to compensation, benefits and incentive compensation expense,   consulting,   account  ing and other professional fees  .

Changes in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016     was   an expense   of   $3.5 million   which consisted of   an increase   of   $841,000   related to the passage of time, partially offset by   an increase   in the fair value due to a change in estimate of   $2.6 million  . 

Changes in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration for the     nine months   ended   September 30, 2015     was an   expense   of $  736  ,000 and consisted of   an increase of $1.  7   million due to the passage of time, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value due to change  s   in estimates of $94  5  ,000.  

Impairment 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $  29.2 million for impairment of goodwill in our   Banking   reporting   unit and   estimated   impairment of goodwill in our Quizzle   reporting   unit.   The   integration   of Quizzle into our Banking segment   during the third quarter   resulted in a triggering event for impairment testing, which now   required   test  ing   the value of   Quizzle s   goodwill based primarily on benefits being provided to the Banking segment.   In our Banking reporting unit   prior to the second quarter, management noted that the operating results of this segment had begun to track below plan, primarily due to macro trends impacting its deposit and display advertising businesses. These events resulted in triggering events for impairment testing  .    See Note 2   t  o Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for more information  . 

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation and amortization expense for the     nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   of   $31.6     million was   $2.3 million     higher   than the same period in     2015   primarily as a result of amortization expense in connection with our acquisitions and higher depreciation expense associated with increased internal capitalized software as compared to   2015  .

Interest and Other Expenses, net 

Interest and other expenses, net for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   of $  14.7   million, decreased $  2.6   million from the same period in   2015,     primarily due the interest income from the deferred receivable for the sale of our insurance business. 

Income Tax Expense 

Our effective tax rate was   an expense   of   -14.4%   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   an expense   of   40.9%   in the same period in   2015  . This   change is primarily attributed to a higher charge taken for stock compensation   in 2016     and the tax non-deductibility of a portion of the GAAP goodwill impairment charge   over a loss before income taxes in 2016. 

Following is a discussion of the results of each of our reportable segments: 

__________ 

(A) 

Includes the results of NextAdvisor since the date of acquisition, June 17, 2016.       

(B) 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we funded approximately $6.1 million for the   proposed   settlement of the private securities class action lawsuit against the Company, and received an $851,000 insurance payment that was received for reimbursement of previously incurred legal expenses in connection with this lawsuit.   Subject to final court approval, the Company has agreed to settle   t  he private securities class action lawsuit for $20.0 million, of which approximately $13.8 million was funded through proceeds of insurance coverage.     

(C) 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, acquisition, disposition and related expenses represent direct expenses related the NextAdvisor acquisition. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, these costs related to the acquisition of Quizzle and other acquisitions.     

(D) 

Restatement charges include   costs related to the Restatement, the Internal Review, the SEC and DOJ investigations and related litigation     and indemnification obligations  .       

(E) 

Represents the   loss from the   operations in China. The results of China were previously presented as discontinued operations when it was actively marketed for sale. After the negotiations with the potential buyer did not result in a sale of the business, we initiated the process   t  o wind down th  os  e operations.      

(F) 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $25.0 million for the impairment of goodwill in our Banking   reporting unit     and   $  4.2   million   estimated   impairment of goodwill     in   our   Quizzle reporting unit  .

Banking 

Revenue decreased $  9.8   million (1  1  .  5  %) for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015  . Of the total revenue decrease, consumer inquiry revenues generated through our rate tables decreased by $  3.4   million (  6.2  %) due to lower advertiser demand in our deposit vertical compared to the prior year. Overall unit pricing was 18.  5  % lower due to our efforts to align the price of each click with the value received by the advertisers, partially offset by a   15.0  % increase in volume due to growth in our mortgage vertical. Other revenue decreased by $  6.4   million primarily driven by a decline in sold advertising impressions. 

Adjusted EBITDA decreased $  11.3   million (  40.9  %) due primarily to reduced revenue. Expenses included in Adjusted EBITDA increased $  1.5   million from the prior year period. Cost of revenue declined by $  1.5 million   primarily due to reduced paid marketing spend. Sales and marketing expense increased by $1.  8   million, mainly attributed to increased compensation and benefits, variable compensation expense and technology spend. Product development costs increased by approximately $  962,000   primarily due to higher compensation, benefit and incentive compensation expense   and   technology spend. General and administrative expenses increased $  308  ,000, primarily due to increased   compensation, benefit and incentive compensation expense  . 

Credit Cards 

Revenue increased $  52.9   million (  29  .7%) for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015  ,    of which approximately   $1  6.2   million was generated by   the NextAdvisor business   since its acquisition date of June 17, 2016. Of the total revenue growth, consumer inquiry revenues from our owned and operated sites grew by $  51.3   million (  41  .  5  %), of which approximately   53  % came through higher pricing and sales conversion and the remainder came through   increased   consumer volume. Other revenue, which is largely comprised of revenue generated through third-party affiliates,   increased    $  1.6   million. 

Adjusted EBITDA   in  creased $  5.0   million (  5.9  %) for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to with 2015. Expenses included in Adjusted EBITDA increased $  47.9   million from the prior year period, primarily due to a $  38.9   million increase in cost of revenue, mainly related to increased paid marketing expense   and   affiliate revenue share payments. Sales and marketing expense increased $  189  ,000, primarily due to higher professional fees. Product development and technology cost increased by $  3.6   million primarily due to higher compensation, benefit and incentive compensation expense. General and administrative expenses were $  5.3   million higher, mainly attributed to higher compensation, benefit and incentive compensation expense and contract labor and consulting costs. 

Senior Care 

Revenue increased $  538,000    (  3.1  %) for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015  .    This was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in revenue from senior housing referrals which is attributable to   a higher number of move-ins from leads provided to senior living communities and an increase in the average referral fees generated.   Advertising revenue was down $920,000 following a decision to de-emphasize pharmaceutical ad campaigns. Subscription revenue declined by $630,000 as we converted expiring subscriptions for senior living communities to referral fee agreements and expiring subscriptions for in-home care providers to cost-per-lead arrangements. However, revenue from selling leads to in-home care providers increased by $121,000 as we ramped up this new revenue source. 

Adjusted EBITDA   de  creased $  196  ,000   (45.5%)   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 2015  . Expenses included in Adjusted EBITDA increased $  699,000   from the prior year period  . C  ost of revenue   de  creased by $  81  ,000 primarily due to lower   lead generation costs   and lower affiliate revenue share payments  , partially offset by     higher employee compensation, benefits and incentive compensation expenses. Sales and marketing expense was $  558  ,000 higher, primarily attributed to employee compensation, benefits  ,    commissions   and consulting expenses  . Product development and technology cost increased by $  246  ,000     primarily attributed to employee compensation, benefits and incentive compensation expense. General and administrative expenses decreased $  24  ,000. 

Other 

The Other segment includes general corporate expenses and intercompany eliminations. Revenue for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   2015   decreased $  1.3 million  ,    and decreased $903,000 excluding China,   while Adjusted EBITDA   excluding China operations, which are being wound down,   decreased $  7.7   million. The revenue decrease is attributed primarily to higher intersegment revenue eliminations. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to compensation, benefits and incentive compensation expense,   consulting,   accounting and other professional fees.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal ongoing source of operating liquidity is the cash generated by our business operations. We consider all highly liquid debt investments purchased with an original maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents. 

Our primary uses of cash have been to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs, fund acquisitions, service our debt obligations   and repurchase of Company shares  . We believe that we can generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund our operating and capital expenditure requirements, as well as to service our debt obligations, for the next 12 months. In the event we experience a significant adverse change in our business operations, we would likely need to secure additional sources of financing. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had working capital of   $176.6   million and our primary commitments were normal working capital requirements and $  2.3   million in accrued interest for the Senior Notes. In addition, we have commitments for guaranteed and contingent earnout obligations related to past acquisitions totaling $  40.4   million as of   September 30, 2016  . 

As of   December 31, 2015  , we had working capital of   $261.3   million and our primary commitments were normal working capital requirements and $  6.9   million in accrued interest for the Senior Notes. We had commitments for guaranteed and contingent earnout obligations related to past acquisitions totaling $16.3 million as of December 31, 2015. 

We assess acquisition opportunities as they arise. Financing may be required if we decide to make additional acquisitions or if we are required to make any earnout payments to which the former owners of our acquired businesses may be entitled. There can be no assurance, however, that any such opportunities may arise, or that any such acquisitions may be consummated. Additional financing may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all when required. 

Debt Financing 

Senior Notes 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $300.0     million in Senior Notes outstanding for which interest is accrued daily on the outstanding principal amount at 6.125% and is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 15  th   and August 15  th  . The Senior Notes are due August 15, 2018. Accrued interest on the Senior Notes as of   September 30, 2016   is approximately   $2.3   million. Refer to Note 10 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of the Senior Notes. 

Our Senior Notes Indenture and Credit Agreement generally permit us to apply the net cash proceeds from the sale of our insurance business to prepay outstanding debt and/or invest in assets useful to our business, in each case, within 365 days of our receipt of such net cash proceeds (subject, in the case of any investment, to a further 180-day extension under certain circumstances). If we do not apply such net cash proceeds in the manner and within the time period described above, we may be required to offer to purchase a portion of our outstanding Senior Notes using those unapplied net cash proceeds at an offer price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase. 

Revolving Credit Facility 

We have a Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of $70.0 million which matures on May 17, 2018 ("Revolving Credit Facility"). All obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Guarantors and are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by first priority liens and security interests in the assets of the Company and the Guarantors. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately $803,000 in letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and we were in compliance with all required covenants. 

Cash Flows 

Operating Activities 

During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , operating activities provided cash of   $37.2 million   compared to   $67.2 million    

41   

Table of Contents  

during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease is mainly due to: 

a    year-over-year   decrease of $  37.9   million in net income excluding non-cash charges (primarily depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation  , impairment charges   and changes in fair value of contingent acquisition consideration)  , primarily attributable to the current year s lower operating results        

an increase   related to   operating assets and liabilities of $  8.5 million         

Investing Activities 

For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , cash used in investing activities was   $71.7 million   and primarily consisted of: 

$  63.4   million for the acquisition of   NextAdvisor     

$  8.3   million for purchases of furniture, fixtures,   leasehold improvements,   equipment and capitalized website development costs      

For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , cash used in investing activities was   $41.2 million     and   primarily consist  ed   of: 

$30.8 million of business acquisitions     

$  10.4   million for purchases of furniture, fixtures, equipment and capitalized website development costs     

Financing Activities 

For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , cash used in financing activities was   $66.9 million   due to: 

the repurchase   of   $5  4  .  6   million     of Company stock   (which   includ  es purchases under the stock purchase program completed in the second quarter 2016 as well as   withholdings for taxes on vesting of employee stock-based compensation awards  )        

$8.6 million of payments of contingent acquisition consideration      

$3.8 million of payments of guaranteed deferred acquisition payments     

For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , cash used by financing activities was   $23.2 million   primarily due to: 

$7.  5   million   of   payment  s   of conti  ngent acquisition consideration        

the repurchase of   $  15.7   million   of   Company stock   for withholdings for taxes on vesting of employee stock-based compensation awards     

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

Off-balance sheet arrangements include the following four categories: obligations under certain guarantees or contracts; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements; obligations under certain derivative arrangements; and obligations under material variable interests. 

Besides our Senior Notes, we have not entered into any material arrangements which would fall under any of these four categories and which would be reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

Interest Rate Risk  

The primary objective of our investment strategy is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from investments     without significantly increasing risk. To minimize this risk, to date we have maintained our portfolio of cash equivalents in short-term     and overnight investments that are not subject to market risk, as the interest paid on such investments fluctuates with the prevailing     interest rates. As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our cash equivalents mature in less than three months. 

None of our outstanding debt as of   September 30, 2016   was subject to variable interest rates as we did not have an outstanding balance for     borrowed money under our Revolving Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  . Interest under the Revolving Credit Facility accrues at variable rates based, at our option, on the   a  lternate base rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) plus a margin of 3.0% or at the adjusted   LIBO   rate     (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) plus a margin of 2.0%. Our   fixed interest rate debt includes $  300.0   million of the Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount. 

Exchange Rate Sensitivity  

Our exposure to exchange rate risk is primarily that of a net receiver of currencies other than the U  .  S  .   dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company's revenue and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars.   The Company generates a limited amount of international revenues, which approximate 1% of its total revenues.   Additionally, we have not engaged in any derivative or hedging transactions to date. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of   September   3  0  , 2016 and determined that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level as of that date. Management based its conclusion on the fact that the material weakness in the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that existed at December 31, 2015, as disclosed in   our 2015   Annual Report, had   not   been remediated at   September 30  , 2016, as the Company was still in the process of fully implementing or testing the effectiveness of various remediation measures. For a description of the material weakness, see Part II, Item 9A in the 2015 Annual Report. 

Management has taken and is taking steps, as described below under  Remediation Plan,  to remediate the material weakness in the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We believe that, as a result of management s review of its accounting processes, and the additional procedures management has implemented, there are no material inaccuracies or omissions of material fact in this   quarterly report   and, to the best of our knowledge, we believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements in this   quarterly report   fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. 

Remediation Plan 

We and our Board treat the control  s surrounding,   and   the   integrity of  ,   our financial statements with the utmost priority. Management is committed to the planning and implementation of remediation efforts to address control deficiencies and any other identified areas of risk. These remediation efforts, which are either implemented or in process, are intended to both address the identified material weakness and to enhance our overall financial control environment. In particular: 

we will complete the training of the new personnel hired in our accounting and financial reporting functions.     

we will continue to strengthen our interim and annual financial review controls to function with a sufficient level of precision to detect and correct errors on a timely basis.     

we will continue to improve the timeliness of our closing processes with respect to interim and annual periods.     

we   have added an   additional internal technical accounting resource.     

we will consolidate our division and corporate accounting onto a single accounting software platform.     

We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment, and we believe the measures described above will strengthen our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weakness we have identified. Our remediation efforts   are underway  , and we will continue to devote significant time and atte  ntion to these remedial efforts  . As we continue to evaluate and work  

43   

Table of Contents  

to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine to take additional measures to strengthen controls or to modify the remediation plan described above, which may require additional implementation time.  

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other than the changes described above under  Remediation Plan  that occurred during the quarter ended   September   3  0  , 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September   3  0  , 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.     OTHER   INFORMATION 

Item 1.        Legal   Proceedings  

The information   with respect to legal proceedings is incorporated by reference from Note   9   of our   Condensed   Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. 

Item 1A.  Risk     Factors  

An investment in our securities involves risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and those set forth in our 2015 Annual Report, as well as the other information included in this Quarterly Report, before investing in our securities. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk facing our Company. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and cause the value of our securities to decline, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Company.
