EXPLANATORY NOTE   
 INC Research Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ) is filing this Amendment No. 2 ( Amendment No. 2 ) to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015, which was originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2016 (the  Original Annual Report ) and subsequently amended on March 14, 2016, for the sole purpose of including
revised Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, which replace the previously filed versions of those exhibits, to include certain statements required by Item 601(b)(31) of Regulation S-K inadvertently omitted when previously filed.  
 Except as described above, no changes have been made to the Original Annual Report. The Original Annual Report continues to speak as of the date of the Original Annual
Report, and the Company has not updated the disclosures contained therein to reflect any events that have occurred as of a date subsequent to the date of the Original Annual Report. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 2 should be read in
conjunction with the Original Annual Report and the Company s filings made with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Original Annual Report. The filing of this Amendment No. 2 is not an admission that the Original Annual Report, when filed,
included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading.
