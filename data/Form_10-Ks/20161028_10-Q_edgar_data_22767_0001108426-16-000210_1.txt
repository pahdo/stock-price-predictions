    Significant Accounting Policies and Responsibility for Financial Statements 
       
  Financial Statement Preparation 
    
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all normal and recurring accruals and adjustments that are necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the consolidated results of operations and comprehensive income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , and cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimated.  Weather causes the Company s results of operations to be seasonal in nature and the results of operations presented in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are not necessarily representative of operations for an entire year. 
    
  The Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include disclosures for PNMR, PNM, and TNMP.  This report uses the term  Company  when discussing matters of common applicability to PNMR, PNM, and TNMP.  Discussions regarding only PNMR, PNM, or TNMP are so indicated.  Certain amounts in the   2015   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the   2016   financial statement presentation. 
    
  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited.  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual Consolidated Financial Statements have been condensed or omitted, as permitted under the applicable rules and regulations.  Readers of these financial statements should refer to PNMR s, PNM s, and TNMP s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto that are included in their respective   2015   Annual Reports on Form 10-K.   
    
  GAAP defines subsequent events as events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.  Based on their nature, magnitude, and timing, certain subsequent events may be required to be reflected at the balance sheet date and/or required to be disclosed in the financial statements.  The Company has evaluated subsequent events as required by GAAP. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of each of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP include their accounts and those of subsidiaries in which that entity owns a majority voting interest.  PNM also consolidates Valencia (Note 5) and, through January 15, 2016, the PVNGS Capital Trust.  PNM owns undivided interests in several jointly-owned power plants and records its pro-rata share of the assets, liabilities, and expenses for those plants.  The agreements for the jointly-owned plants provide that if an owner were to default on its payment obligations, the non-defaulting owners would be responsible for their proportionate share of the obligations of the defaulting owner.  In exchange, the non-defaulting owners would be entitled to their proportionate share of the generating capacity of the defaulting owner.  There have been no such payment defaults under any of the agreements for the jointly-owned plants. 
    
  PNMR shared services  administrative and general expenses, which represent costs that are primarily driven by corporate level activities, are charged to the business segments.  These services are billed at cost.  Other significant intercompany transactions between PNMR, PNM, and TNMP include interest and income tax sharing payments, as well as equity transactions.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  See Note 14. 
    
  Dividends on Common Stock 
    
  Dividends on PNMR s common stock are declared by its Board.  The timing of the declaration of dividends is dependent on the timing of meetings and other actions of the Board.  This has historically resulted in dividends considered to be attributable to the second quarter of each year being declared through actions of the Board during the third quarter of the year.  The Board declared dividends on common stock considered to be for the second quarter of   $0.22   per share in July 2016 and   $0.20   in July

2015, which are reflected as being in the second quarter within  Dividends Declared per Common Share  on the PNMR Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  The Board declared dividends on common stock considered to be for the third quarter of   $0.22   per share in September 2016 and   $0.20   per share in September 2015, which are reflected as being in the third quarter within  Dividends Declared per Common Share  on the PNMR Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
    
  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, PNMR made equity contributions of   $28.1 million   to PNM and   $50.0 million   to TNMP.  PNM declared and paid cash dividends on common stock to PNMR of   $4.1 million   and   $46.2 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  TNMP declared and paid cash dividends on common stock to PNMR of   $18.0 million   and   $19.6 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not been adopted by the Company is presented below. 
    
  Accounting Standards Update 2014-09       Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09.  The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  When it becomes effective, the new standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP.  In August 2015, the FASB issued a one-year deferral in the effective date.  Since the issuance of ASU No. 2014-09, the FASB also has issued additional ASUs that clarify implementation guidance regarding principal versus agent considerations, licensing, and identifying performance obligations, as well as adding certain additional practical expedients.  The Company must adopt ASU 2014-09 beginning on January 1, 2018.  Early adoption would be permitted beginning January 1, 2017.  The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  The Company has not yet selected a transition method although it is unlikely the Company would elect to early adopt the new standard.  The Company is analyzing the impacts this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, but has not determined the effect of the standard on its financial reporting. 
    
  Accounting Standards Update 2014-15       Presentation of Financial Statements       Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40):  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, which requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern in connection with the preparation of financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period.  Disclosure requirements associated with management s evaluation are also outlined in the new guidance.  The new standard is effective for the Company for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company anticipates adopting this standard as of December 31, 2016.  The Company is analyzing the impacts of this new standard, but does not anticipate it will have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  Accounting Standards Update 2016-01       Financial Instruments (Subtopic 825-10)       Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, which makes targeted improvements to GAAP regarding financial instruments.  The new standard eliminates the requirement to classify investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values into trading or available-for-sale categories and will require those equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income rather than in OCI.  Also, the new standard will revise certain presentation and disclosure requirements.  Under the new standard, accounting for investments in debt securities remains essentially unchanged.  The new standard will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018.  Early adoption of the standard is permitted.  The Company is in the process of analyzing the impacts of this new standard.

Accounting Standards Update 2016-02       Leases (Topic 842) 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, which will change how lessees account for leases.  The ASU will require that a liability be recorded on the balance sheet for all leases based on the present value of future lease obligations.  A corresponding right-of-use asset will also be recorded.  Amortization of the lease obligation and the right-of-use asset for certain leases, primarily those classified as operating leases, will be on a straight-line basis, which is not expected to have a significant impact on the statements of earnings or cash flows, whereas other leases will be required to be accounted for as financing arrangements similar to the accounting treatment for capital leases under current GAAP.  Also, the new standard will revise certain disclosure requirements.  The new standard will be effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019.  Early adoption of the standard is permitted.  At adoption of the ASU, leases will be recognized and measured as of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.  The Company is in the process of analyzing the impacts of this new standard. 
    
  Accounting Standards Update 2016-09       Compensation       Stock Compensation (Topic 718) 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09.  The ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  Currently, tax benefits resulting from deductions in excess of compensation cost on vested restricted stock and performance awards and on exercised stock options ( excess tax benefits ) are recorded to equity provided these benefits reduce taxes payable.  Tax deficiencies resulting from deductions related to awards, which are below realized compensation cost upon vesting and on canceled stock options are recorded to equity.   The Company has not recorded excess tax benefits to equity since 2009 because it is in a net operating loss position for income tax purposes.  Upon implementation of the new standard, the Company will record a cumulative effect adjustment to recognize excess tax benefits that have not been recorded due to the Company s net operating loss.  Subsequent to implementation, all excess tax benefits and deficiencies will be recorded to tax expense on the Condensed Consolidated Income Statements and classified as cash flows from operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The Company continues its process of analyzing the impacts of this new standard, but does not believe there will be any retrospective impacts to its financial statements.  The Company anticipates adopting the new standard upon its required effective date of January 1, 2017. 
    
  Accounting Standards Update 2016-13       Financial Instruments       Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13.  The ASU changes the way entities recognize impairment of many financial assets, including accounts receivable and investments in debt securities, by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over their remaining lives.  The new standard is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020.  Early adoption is permitted beginning on January 1, 2019.   The Company is in the process of analyzing the impacts of this new standard. 
    
  Accounting Standards Update 2016-15       Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15.  The ASU eliminates diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period.   The Company is in the process of analyzing the impacts of this new standard, but does not anticipate it will have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.

At December 31, 2015, the Company adopted ASU 2015-03     Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)   and ASU 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740  )   - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  , which require that debt issuance costs be reflected as a direct reduction of the related debt liability, except for arrangements such as the Company s revolving credit facilities, and eliminated the requirement to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current or current.  The Company applied the updates retrospectively to make all periods comparable.  As a result, amounts previously reported as total assets at September 30, 2015 above have been reduced to reflect the reclassifications aggregating   $40.3 million   for PNMR,   $22.1 million   for PNM, and   $10.4 million   for TNMP.

    Variable Interest Entities 
       
  GAAP determines how an enterprise evaluates and accounts for its involvement with variable interest entities, focusing primarily on whether the enterprise has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a variable interest entity ( VIE ).  GAAP also requires continual reassessment of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.  Additional information concerning PNM s VIEs is contained in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the   2015   Annual Reports on Form 10-K. 
    
  Valencia 
    
  PNM has a PPA to purchase all of the electric capacity and energy from Valencia, a   158   MW natural gas-fired power plant near Belen, New Mexico, through May 2028.  A third-party built, owns, and operates the facility while PNM is the sole purchaser of the electricity generated.  PNM is obligated to pay fixed operations and maintenance and capacity charges in addition to variable operation and maintenance charges under this PPA.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PNM paid   $4.9 million   and   $14.5 million   for fixed charges and   $0.5 million   and   $1.1 million   for variable charges.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , PNM paid   $4.9 million   and   $14.5 million   for fixed charges and   $0.3 million   and   $0.9 million   for variable charges.  PNM does not have any other financial obligations related to Valencia.  The assets of Valencia can only be used to satisfy obligations of Valencia and creditors of Valencia do not have any recourse against PNM s assets.  PNM has concluded that the third party entity that owns Valencia is a VIE and that PNM is the primary beneficiary of the entity under GAAP since PNM has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Valencia and will absorb the majority of the variability in the cash flows of the plant.  As the primary beneficiary, PNM consolidates Valencia in its financial statements.  The assets and liabilities of Valencia set forth below are immaterial to PNM and, therefore, not shown separately on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The owner s equity and net income of Valencia are considered attributable to non-controlling interest.  
    
  Summarized financial information for Valencia is as follows: 
    
  Results of Operations 

Financial Position 

During the term of the PPA, PNM has the option to purchase and own up to   50%   of the plant or the VIE.  The PPA specifies that the purchase price would be the greater of (i)   50%   of book value reduced by related indebtedness or (ii)   50%   of fair market

value.  On October 8, 2013, PNM notified the owner of Valencia that PNM may exercise the option to purchase   50%   of the plant.  As provided in the PPA, an appraisal process was initiated since the parties failed to reach agreement on fair market value within   60   days.  Under the PPA, results of the appraisal process established the purchase price after which PNM was to determine in its sole discretion whether or not to exercise its option to purchase the   50%   interest.  The PPA also provides that the purchase price may be adjusted to reflect the period between the determination of the purchase price and the closing.  The appraisal process determined the purchase price as of October 8, 2013 to be   $85.0 million  , prior to any adjustment to reflect the period through the closing date.  Approval of the NMPRC and FERC would be required, which process could take up to   15   months.  On May 30, 2014, after evaluating its alternatives with respect to Valencia, PNM notified the owner of Valencia that PNM intended to purchase   50%   of the plant, subject to certain conditions.  PNM s conditions include: agreeing on the purchase price, adjusted to reflect the period between October 8, 2013 and the closing; approval of the NMPRC, including specified ratemaking treatment, and FERC; approval of the Board and PNM s board of directors; receipt of other necessary approvals and consents; and other customary closing conditions.  PNM received a letter dated June 30, 2014 from the owner of Valencia suggesting that the conditions set forth in PNM s notification raise issues under the PPA.  The owner of Valencia submitted a counter-proposal to PNM in April 2015 and the parties are continuing to have periodic discussions.  PNM cannot predict if it will reach agreement with the owner of Valencia, if required regulatory and other approvals will be received, or if the purchase will be completed. 
    
  PVNGS Leases       
    
  PNM leases interests in Units 1 and 2 of PVNGS under arrangements, which initially were scheduled to expire on January 15, 2015 for the   four   Unit 1 leases and January 15, 2016 for the   four   Unit 2 leases.  At January 15, 2015, the   four   Unit 1 leases were extended.  At January 15, 2016,   one   of the Unit 2 leases was extended and PNM exercised its fair market value options to purchase the assets underlying the other   three   Unit 2 leases.  See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the   2015   Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Note 6 for additional information regarding the leases, including PNM s actions regarding the renewal and purchase options.  See Note 12 for information concerning the NMPRC s treatment of the purchased assets and extended leases in PNM s NM 2015 Rate Case.   
    
  Each of the lease agreements is with a different trust whose beneficial owner is an institutional investor.  PNM is not the legal or tax owner of the leased assets.  The beneficial owners of the trusts possess all of the voting control and pecuniary interest in the trusts.  PNM is only obligated to make payments to the trusts for the scheduled semi-annual lease payments and other than as discussed in Note 6, PNM has   no   other financial obligations or commitments to the trusts or the beneficial owners although PNM is responsible for all decommissioning obligations related to its entire interest in PVNGS both during and after termination of the leases.  Creditors of the trusts have   no   recourse to PNM s assets other than with respect to the contractual lease payments.  PNM has   no   additional rights to the assets of the trusts other than the use of the leased assets.  PNM has   no   assets or liabilities recorded on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the trusts other than accrued lease payments of   $3.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $18.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  , which are included in other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Prior to their exercise or expiration, PNM s fixed rate renewal options were considered to be variable interests in the trusts and resulted in the trusts being considered VIEs under GAAP.  PNM evaluated the PVNGS lease arrangements, including actions taken with respect to the renewal and purchase options, and concluded that it did not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impacted the economic performance of the trusts and, therefore, was not the primary beneficiary of the trusts under GAAP.  Upon execution of documents establishing terms of the asset purchases or lease extensions, PNM s variable interest in the trusts ceased to exist.   
    
  Westmoreland San Juan LLC ( WSJ ) and SJCC 
    
  As discussed in the subheading Coal Supply in Note 11, PNM purchases coal for SJGS from SJCC under a coal supply agreement ( CSA ).  That section includes information on the purchase of SJCC by WSJ on January 31, 2016, as well as a   $125.0 million   loan (the  Westmoreland Loan ) from NM Capital, a subsidiary of PNMR, to WSJ, which loan provided substantially all of the funds required for the SJCC purchase, and the issuance of a   $40.0 million   letter of credit support under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility to facilitate the issuance of reclamation bonds required in order for SJCC to mine coal to be supplied to SJGS.  The Westmoreland Loan and the letter of credit support result in PNMR being considered to have a variable interest in WSJ, including its subsidiary, SJCC, since PNMR and NM Capital could be subject to loss in the event WSJ were to default under the Westmoreland Lo

an and/or performance under the letter of credit support was required.  Principal payments under the Westmoreland Loan began on August 1, 2016 and are required quarterly thereafter.  Interest is also paid quarterly beginning on May 1, 2016.   
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the amount outstanding under the Westmoreland Loan was   $110.0 million  , after the August 1, 2016 scheduled principal payment of   $15.0 million  , and is reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet net of unamortized fees.  In addition, interest receivable of   $1.5 million   is included in Other receivables.  In August 2016, the   $40.0 million   letter of credit support was reduced to   $30.3 million  .  The Westmoreland Loan requires that all cash flows of WSJ, in excess of normal operating expenses, capital additions, and operating reserves, be utilized for principal and interest payments under the loan until it is fully repaid.  A principal payment of   $15.0 million   plus interest of   $2.3 million   is due on November 1, 2016.  As of October 21, 2016,   $17.3 million   was held in a restricted bank account that is to be used solely to service the Westmoreland Loan.  The Westmoreland Loan is secured by the assets of and the equity interests in SJCC.  In the event of a default by WSJ, NM Capital would have the ability to take over the mining operations.  In such event, NM Capital would likely engage a third-party mining company to operate SJCC so that operations of the mine are not disrupted.  Since the acquisition of SJCC by WSJ for approximately   $125.0 million   is a recently negotiated, arms-length transaction between Westmoreland and BHP, the amount should approximate the fair value of SJCC.  Therefore, if WSJ were to default, NM Capital should be able to acquire assets of approximately the value of the Westmoreland Loan without a significant loss.  Furthermore, PNMR considers the possibility of loss under the letter of credit support to be remote since the purpose of posting the bonds is to provide assurance that SJCC performs the required reclamation of the mine site in accordance with applicable regulations and all reclamation costs are reimbursable under the CSA.  Also, much of the mine reclamation activities will not be performed for many years in the future, including after the expiration of the CSA and the final maturity of the Westmoreland Loan.  In addition, each of the SJGS participants has established, and funds, a trust to meet its future reclamation obligations. 
    
  Both WSJ and SJCC are considered to be VIEs.  PNMR s analysis of these arrangements concluded that Westmoreland, as the parent of WSJ, has the ability to direct the SJCC mining operations, which is the factor that most significantly impacts the economic performance of WSJ and SJCC.  NM Capital s rights under the Westmoreland Loan are the typical protective rights of a lender, but do not give NM Capital any oversight over mining operations unless there is a default under the loan.  Other than PNM being able to ensure that coal is supplied in adequate quantities and of sufficient quality to provide the fuel necessary to operate SJGS in a normal manner, the mining operations are solely under the control of Westmoreland and its subsidiaries, including developing mining plans, hiring of personnel, and incurring operating and maintenance expenses.  Neither PNMR nor PNM has any ability to direct or influence the mining operation.  Therefore, PNM s involvement through the CSA is a protective right rather than a participating right and Westmoreland has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the SJCC.  The CSA requires SJCC to deliver coal required to fuel SJGS in exchange for payment of a set price per ton, which is escalated over time for inflation. If SJCC is able to mine more efficiently than anticipated, its economic performance will be improved.  Conversely, if SJCC cannot mine as efficiently as anticipated, its economic performance will be negatively impacted.  Accordingly, PNMR believes Westmoreland is the primary beneficiary of WSJ and, therefore, WSJ and SJCC are not consolidated by either PNMR or PNM.  The amounts outstanding under the Westmoreland Loan and the letter of credit support constitute PNMR s maximum exposure to loss from the VIEs.

    Lease Commitments 
       
  The Company leases office buildings, vehicles, and other equipment under operating leases. In addition, PNM leases interests in Units 1 and 2 of PVNGS and, through April 1, 2015, leased an interest in the EIP transmission line.  All of the Company s leases are currently accounted for as operating leases.  See Note 1.  Additional information concerning the Company s lease commitments is contained in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the   2015   Annual Reports on Form 10-K, including PNM s actions with regard to renewal and purchase options under the PVNGS leases.     
    
  The PVNGS leases were scheduled to expire on January 15, 2015 for the   four   Unit 1 leases and January 15, 2016 for the   four   Unit 2 leases.  The   four   Unit 1 leases have been extended to expire on January 15, 2023 and   one   of the Unit 2 leases has been extended to expire on January 15, 2024.  For the other   three   PVNGS Unit 2 leases, PNM exercised its fair market value options to purchase the assets underlying those leases on the expiration date of the original leases.  On January 15, 2016, PNM paid   $78.1 million   to the lessor under   one   lease for   31.25   MW of the entitlement from PVNGS Unit 2 and   $85.2 million   to the lessors under the other   two   leases for   32.76   MW of the entitlement from PVNGS Unit 2.  See Note 12 for information concerning the NMPRC s treatment of the purchased assets and extended leases in PNM s NM 2015 Rate Case.

PNM is exposed to losses under the PVNGS lease arrangements upon the occurrence of certain events that PNM does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur.  Under certain circumstances (for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to PVNGS or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), PNM would be required to make specified payments to the lessors, and take title to the leased interests.  If such an event had occurred as of   September 30, 2016  , amounts due to the lessors under the circumstances described above would be up to   $176.1 million  , payable on January 15, 2017 in addition to the scheduled lease payments due on January 15, 2017.  
    
  At March 31, 2015, PNM owned   60%   of the EIP and leased the other   40%  , under a lease that expired on April 1, 2015.  PNM purchased the leased capacity at fair market value, which the parties agreed was   $7.7 million  , on April 1, 2015.

    Fair Value of Derivative and Other Financial Instruments  
       
  Additional information concerning the Company s energy related derivative contracts and other financial instruments is contained in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the   2015   Annual Reports on Form 10-K. 
    
  Fair value is defined under GAAP as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  Fair value is based on current market quotes as available and is supplemented by modeling techniques and assumptions made by the Company to the extent quoted market prices or volatilities are not available.  External pricing input availability for commodity derivatives varies based on commodity location, market liquidity, and term of the agreement.  Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities take into account nonperformance risk including the effect of counterparties  and the Company s credit risk.  The Company regularly assesses the validity and availability of pricing data for its derivative transactions.  Although the Company uses its best judgment in estimating fair values, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique. 
    
  Energy Related Derivative Contracts 
    
  Overview 
    
  The primary objective for the use of derivative instruments, including energy contracts, options, and futures, is to manage price risk associated with forecasted purchases of energy and fuel used to generate electricity, as well as managing anticipated generation capacity in excess of forecasted demand from existing customers.  PNM s energy related derivative contracts manage commodity risk.  PNM is required to meet the demand and energy needs of its retail and firm-requirements wholesale customers.  PNM is exposed to market risk for its share of PVNGS Unit 3 and the needs of its firm-requirements wholesale customers not covered under a FPPAC.  However, as discussed below, PNM has hedging arrangements for the output of PVNGS Unit 3 through December 31, 2017, at which time PVNGS Unit 3 will be included as a jurisdictional resource to serve New Mexico retail customers.  PNM s operations are managed primarily through a net asset-backed strategy, whereby PNM s aggregate net open forward contract position is covered by its forecasted excess generation capabilities or market purchases.  PNM could be exposed to market risk if its generation capabilities were to be disrupted or if its load requirements were to be greater than anticipated.  If all or a portion of load requirements were required to be covered as a result of such unexpected situations, commitments would have to be met through market purchases.   
  Commodity Risk 
  Marketing and procurement of energy often involve market risks associated with managing energy commodities and establishing open positions in the energy markets, primarily on a short-term basis.  PNM routinely enters into various derivative instruments such as forward contracts, option agreements, and price basis swap agreements to economically hedge price and volume risk on power commitments and fuel requirements and to minimize the effect of market fluctuations in wholesale portfolios.  PNM monitors the market risk of its commodity contracts using VaR calculations to maintain total exposure within management-prescribed limits in accordance with approved risk and credit policies.

Accounting for Derivatives 
    
  Under derivative accounting and related rules for energy contracts, the Company accounts for its various derivative instruments for the purchase and sale of energy based on the Company s intent.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company was not hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows from commodity derivatives through designated cash flows hedges.  The contracts recorded at fair value that do not qualify or are not designated for cash flow hedge accounting are classified as economic hedges.  Economic hedges are defined as derivative instruments, including long-term power agreements, used to economically hedge generation assets, purchased power and fuel costs, and customer load requirements.  Changes in the fair value of economic hedges are reflected in results of operations and are classified between operating revenues and cost of energy according to the intent of the hedge.  The Company has no trading transactions. 
    
  Commodity Derivatives 
    
  Commodity derivative instruments that are recorded at fair value, all of which are accounted for as economic hedges, are summarized as follows: 

Included in the above table are   $2.7 million   of current assets and   $0.6 million   of deferred charges at   September 30, 2016   and   $3.0 million   of current assets and   $2.6 million   of deferred charges at   December 31, 2015   related to contracts for the sale of energy from PVNGS Unit 3 through 2017 at market price plus a premium.  Certain of PNM s commodity derivative instruments in the above table are subject to master netting agreements whereby assets and liabilities could be offset in the settlement process.  The Company does not offset fair value, cash collateral, and accrued payable or receivable amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements and the above table reflects the gross amounts of assets and liabilities.  The amounts that could be offset under master netting agreements were immaterial at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , PNMR and PNM had   no   amounts recognized for the legal right to reclaim cash collateral.  However, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , amounts posted as cash collateral under margin arrangements were   $3.0 million   and   $2.7 million   for both PNMR and PNM.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , obligations to return cash collateral were   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million   for both PNMR and PNM.  Cash collateral amounts are included in other current assets and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
     
  PNM has a NMPRC approved hedging plan to manage fuel and purchased power costs related to customers covered by its FPPAC.  The table above includes   $0.1 million   of current assets, less than   $0.1 million   of deferred charges, and less than   $0.1 million   of current liabilities at September 30, 2016 and   $0.4 million   of current assets and   $0.2 million   of current liabilities at   December 31, 2015   related to this plan.  The offsets to these amounts are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table presents the effect of mark-to-market commodity derivative instruments on earnings, excluding income tax effects.  Commodity derivatives had no impact on OCI for the periods presented. 

Commodity contract volume positions are presented in MMBTU for gas related contracts and in MWh for power related contracts.  The table below presents PNMR s and PNM s net buy (sell) volume positions: 

In connection with managing its commodity risks, the Company enters into master agreements with certain counterparties.  If the Company is in a net liability position under an agreement, some agreements provide that the counterparties can request collateral from the Company if the Company s credit rating is downgraded; other agreements provide that the counterparty may request collateral to provide it with  adequate assurance  that the Company will perform; and others have no provision for collateral.   
    
  The table below presents information about the Company s contingent requirements to provide collateral under commodity contracts having an objectively determinable collateral provision that are in net liability positions and are not fully collateralized with cash.  Contractual Liability represents commodity derivative contracts recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, determined on an individual contract basis without offsetting amounts for individual contracts that are in an asset position and could be offset under master netting agreements with the same counterparty.  The table only reflects cash collateral that has been posted under the existing contracts and does not reflect letters of credit under the PNM Revolving Credit Facility that have been issued as collateral.  Net Exposure is the net contractual liability for all contracts, including those designated as normal purchases and normal sales, offset by existing cash collateral and by any offsets available under master netting agreements, including both asset and liability positions. 

Sale of Power from PVNGS Unit 3 
    
  Because PNM s   134   MW share of Unit 3 at PVNGS is not currently included in retail rates, that unit s power is being sold in the wholesale market.  PVNGS Unit 3 will be included as a jurisdictional resource to serve New Mexico retail customers beginning on January 1, 2018.  As of   September 30, 2016  , PNM had contracted to sell   100%   of PVNGS Unit 3 output through 2017, at market price plus a premium.   Through hedging arrangements that are accounted for as economic hedges, PNM has established fixed rates for substantially all of the sales through 2017, which average approximately   $26   per MWh in 2016 and   $29   per MWh in 2017.

Non-Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  The carrying amounts reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value for cash, receivables, and payables due to the short period of maturity.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value.  Available-for-sale securities for PNMR and PNM consist of PNM assets held in the NDT for its share of decommissioning costs of PVNGS and trusts for PNM s share of post-term reclamation costs related to the coal mines serving SJGS and Four Corners (Note 11).  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of available-for-sale securities included   $258.6 million   and   $249.1 million   for the NDT and   $12.4 million   and   $9.9 million   for the mine reclamation trusts.  The fair value and gross unrealized gains of investments in available-for-sale securities are presented in the following table.   

The proceeds and gross realized gains and losses on the disposition of available-for-sale securities for PNMR and PNM are shown in the following table.  Realized gains and losses are determined by specific identification of costs of securities sold.  Gross realized losses shown below exclude the change in realized impairment losses of   $0.1 million   and   $1.0 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   $(2.4) million   and   $(3.2) million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Held-to-maturity securities are those investments in debt securities that the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity.  At September 30, 2016, held-to-maturity securities consist of the Westmoreland Loan.  
    
  The Company has   no   available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities for which carrying value exceeds fair value.  There are   no   impairments considered to be  other than temporary  that are included in AOCI and not recognized in earnings.

Fair Value Disclosures 
  The Company determines the fair values of its derivative and other financial instruments based on the hierarchy established in GAAP, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  GAAP describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.  Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  Level 3 inputs used in determining fair values for the Company consist of internal valuation models.  The Company records any transfers between fair value hierarchy levels as of the end of each calendar quarter.  There were no transfers between levels during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  For available-for-sale securities, Level 2 fair values are provided by the trustee utilizing a pricing service.  The pricing provider predominantly uses the market approach using bid side market value based upon a hierarchy of information for specific securities or securities with similar characteristics.  For commodity derivatives, Level 2 fair values are determined based on market observable inputs, which are validated using multiple broker quotes, including forward price, volatility, and interest rate curves to establish expectations of future prices.  Credit valuation adjustments are made for estimated credit losses based on the overall exposure to each counterparty.  For the Company s long-term debt, Level 2 fair values are provided by an external pricing service.  The pricing service primarily utilizes quoted prices for similar debt in active markets when determining fair value.  For investments categorized as Level 3, including the Westmoreland Loan, PVNGS lessor notes, and certain items in other investments, fair values were determined by discounted cash flow models that take into consideration discount rates that are observable for similar types of assets and liabilities.  Management of the Company independently verifies the information provided by pricing services.

    Stock-Based Compensation 
       
  PNMR has various stock-based compensation programs, including stock options, restricted stock, and performance shares granted under the Performance Equity Plan ( PEP ).  Although certain PNM and TNMP employees participate in the PNMR plans, PNM and TNMP do not have separate employee stock-based compensation plans.  In 2011, the Company changed its approach to awarding stock-based compensation.  As a result,   no   stock options have been granted since 2010 and awards of restricted stock have increased.  Certain restricted stock awards are subject to achieving performance or market targets.  Other awards of restricted stock are only subject to time vesting requirements.  Additional information concerning stock-based compensation under the PEP is contained in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the   2015   Annual Reports on Form 10-K.   
    
  Restricted stock under the PEP refers to awards of stock subject to vesting, performance, or market conditions rather than to shares with contractual post-vesting restrictions.  Generally, the awards vest ratably over   three   years from the grant date of the award.  However, awards with performance or market conditions vest upon satisfaction of those conditions.  In addition, plan provisions provide that upon retirement, participants become   100%   vested in certain stock awards. 
    
  The stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards without performance or market conditions for awards to participants that are retirement eligible on the grant date is recognized immediately at the grant date and is not amortized.  Compensation expense for other such awards is amortized to compensation expense over the shorter of the requisite vesting period, which is generally three years, or the period until the participant becomes retirement eligible.  Compensation expense for performance-based shares is recognized ratably over the performance period and is adjusted periodically to reflect the level of

achievement expected to be attained.  Compensation expense related to market-based shares is recognized ratably over the measurement period, regardless of the actual level of achievement, provided the employees meet their service requirements.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , PNMR had unrecognized expense related to stock awards of   $5.9 million   and   $5.7 million  , which are expected to be recognized over an average of   1.9   and   1.4   years.   
    
  The grant date fair value for restricted stock and stock awards with Company internal performance targets is determined based on the market price of PNMR common stock on the date of the agreements reduced by the present value of future dividends, which will not be received prior to vesting, applied to the total number of shares that are anticipated to vest, although the number of performance shares that ultimately vest cannot be determined until after the performance periods end.  The grant date fair value of stock awards with market targets is determined using Monte Carlo simulation models, which provide grant date fair values that include an expectation of the number of shares to vest at the end of the measurement period. 
    
  The following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions used to determine the awards grant date fair value: 

The following table summarizes activity in restricted stock awards, including performance-based and market-based shares, and stock options, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

PNMR s stock-based compensation program provides for performance and market targets through 2018.  Included as granted and exercised in the above table are   79,619   previously awarded shares that were earned for the 2013 through 2015 performance measurement period and approved by the Board in February 2016 (based upon achieving market targets at  target  levels, weighted at   60%  , and performance targets at  threshold  levels, weighted at   40%  ).  Excluded from the above table are maximums of   165,628  ,   166,797  , and   147,031   shares for the   three  -year performance periods ending in 2016, 2017, and 2018 that would be awarded if all performance and market criteria are achieved at maximum levels and all executives remain eligible.   
    
  In March 2012, the Company entered into a retention award agreement with its Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer under which she would receive   135,000   shares of PNMR s common stock if PNMR meets specific market targets at the end of 2016 and she remains an employee of the Company.  Under the agreement, she would receive   35,000   of the total shares if

PNMR achieved specific market targets at the end of 2014.  The specified market target was achieved at the end of 2014 and the Board approved her receiving the   35,000   shares in February 2015.  The retention award was made under the PEP and was approved by the Board on February 28, 2012.  The above table does not include the restricted stock shares that remain unvested under this retention award agreement. 
    
  Effective as of January 1, 2015, the Company entered into a retention award agreement with its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer under which he would receive awards of restricted stock if PNMR meets specific performance targets at the end of 2016 and 2017 and he remains an employee of the Company.  If PNMR achieves the specific performance target for the period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016, he would receive   $100,000   of PNMR common stock based on the market value per share on the grant date in early 2017.  Similarly, if PNMR achieves the specific performance target for the period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017, he would receive   $275,000   of PNMR common stock based on the market value per share on the grant date in early 2018.  If the target for the first performance period is not met, but the target for the second performance period is met, he would receive both awards, less any amount received previously under the agreement.  The retention award was made under the PEP and was approved by the Board on December 9, 2014.  The above table does not include any restricted stock shares under this retention award agreement. 
    
  In March 2015, the Company entered into a retention award agreement with its Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer under which she would receive   53,859   shares of PNMR s common stock if PNMR meets certain performance targets at the end of 2019 and she remains an employee of the Company.  Under the agreement, she would receive   17,953   of the total shares if PNMR achieves specific performance targets at the end of 2017.  The retention award was made under the PEP and was approved by the Board on February 26, 2015.  The above table does not include any restricted stock shares under this retention award agreement.          
  At   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding, all of which are exercisable, was   $6.3 million   with a weighted-average remaining contract life of   2.22   years.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   no   outstanding stock options had an exercise price greater than the closing price of PNMR common stock on that date.

    Financing 
       
  The Company s financing strategy includes both short-term and long-term borrowings.  The Company utilizes short-term revolving credit facilities, as well as cash flows from operations, to provide funds for both construction and operating expenditures.  Depending on market and other conditions, the Company will periodically sell long-term debt or enter into term loan arrangements and use the proceeds to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit facilities.  Each of the revolving credit facilities and the Company s term loans contains   one   financial covenant, which requires the maintenance of debt-to-capital ratios of less than or equal to   65%   and generally include customary covenants, events of default, cross default provisions, and change of control provisions.  PNM must obtain NMPRC approval for any financing transaction having a maturity of more than   18   months.  In addition, PNM files its annual short-term financing plan with the NMPRC.  Additional information concerning financing activities is contained in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the   2015   Annual Reports on Form 10-K.

Financing Activities 
    
   On March 9, 2015, PNMR entered into a   $150.0 million   Term Loan Agreement ( PNMR 2015 Term Loan Agreement ) between PNMR, the lenders identified therein, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Lender and Administrative Agent.  The PNMR 2015 Term Loan Agreement bears interest at a variable rate, which was   1.42%   at   September 30, 2016  , and must be repaid on or before March 9, 2018.  In September 2015, PNMR entered into a hedging agreement whereby it effectively established a fixed interest rate of   1.927%  , subject to change if there is a change in PNMR s credit rating, for borrowings under the PNMR 2015 Term Loan Agreement for the period from January 11, 2016 through March 9, 2018.  This hedge is accounted for as a cash-flow hedge and had a fair value loss of   $0.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , which is included in Other deferred credits on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and a fair value gain of   $0.1 million   at December 31, 2015, using Level 2 inputs under GAAP determined using forward LIBOR curves under the mid-market convention to discount cash flows over the remaining term of the swap agreements. 
    
  As discussed in Note 11, NM Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of PNMR, entered into a   $125.0 million   term loan agreement (the  BTMU Term Loan Agreement ), among NM Capital, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. ( BTMU ), as lender, and BTMU, as Administrative Agent, as of February 1, 2016.  The BTMU Term Loan Agreement has a maturity date of February 1, 2021 and bears interest at a rate based on LIBOR plus a customary spread, which aggregated   3.51%   at   September 30, 2016  .  PNMR, as parent company of NM Capital, has guaranteed NM Capital s obligations to BTMU.  NM Capital utilized the proceeds of the BTMU Term Loan Agreement to provide funding of   $125.0 million   (the  Westmoreland Loan ) to a ring-fenced, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose entity that is a subsidiary of Westmoreland Coal Company to finance the purchase price of the stock of SJCC.  The BTMU Term Loan Agreement provides that the amount outstanding thereunder must be reduced by at least   $5.0 million   quarterly beginning on November 1, 2016.  NM Capital is also required to utilize the net proceeds of all amounts received under the Westmoreland Loan, after income taxes and fees, to make principal and interest payments on the BTMU Term Loan Agreement.  The principal balance outstanding under the BTMU Term Loan Agreement was   $107.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  Based on scheduled payments on the Westmoreland Loan, NM Capital estimates it will make principal payments of   $45.1 million   on the BTMU Term Loan Agreement in the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. 
    
  On December 17, 2015, TNMP entered into an agreement (the  TNMP 2015 Bond Purchase Agreement ), which provided that TNMP would issue   $60.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.53%   first mortgage bonds, due 2026 (the  Series 2016A Bonds ) on or about February 10, 2016, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions.  TNMP issued the Series 2016A Bonds on February 10, 2016 and used the proceeds to reduce short-term debt and intercompany debt. 
    
  On May 20, 2016, PNM entered into a   $175.0 million   term loan agreement (the  PNM 2016 Term Loan Agreement ) between PNM and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as lender and administrative agent.  The PNM 2016 Term Loan Agreement bears interest at a variable rate, which was   1.15%   at   September 30, 2016  , and has a maturity date of November 17, 2017.  PNM used a portion of the proceeds of the PNM 2016 Term Loan Agreement to prepay without penalty the   $125.0 million   outstanding under the PNM Multi-draw Term Loan, which had a scheduled maturity of June 21, 2016. 
    
  On September 27, 2016, PNM participated in the issuance and sale of an aggregate of   $146.0 million   of PCRBs by the City of Farmington, New Mexico. The proceeds from the sale were utilized to refund an aggregate of   $146.0 million   of outstanding PCRBs previously issued by the City of Farmington. The arrangements governing the PCRBs result in PNM reflecting the bonds as debt on its financial statements.  The PCRBs issued consist of the 2016 Series A in the aggregate principal amount of   $46.0 million   and the 2016 Series B in the aggregate principal amount of   $100.0 million  .  Both series bear interest at a rate of   1.875%   for the period from September 27, 2016 through September 30, 2021, have a mandatory tender for remarketing on October 1, 2021, and a final maturity on April 1, 2033. 
    
  On October 21, 2016, PNMR entered into a letter of credit arrangement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under which letters of credit aggregating   $30.3 million   (the  JPM LOCs ) were issued to replace letters of credit issued from available capacity under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility.  The letters of credit issued from available capacity under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility will be surrendered and canceled upon acceptance of the JPM LOCs by the surety companies that issue the reclamation bonds.  The letters of credit facilitate the posting of reclamation bonds, which SJCC was required to post in connection with permits relating to the operation of the San Juan mine (Note 11).

  The PNMR Revolving Credit Facility has a financing capacity of   $300.0 million   and the PNM Revolving Credit Facility has a financing capacity of   $400.0 million  , both of which mature on October 31, 2020.  The TNMP Revolving Credit Facility is a   $75.0 million   revolving credit facility secured by   $75.0 million   aggregate principal amount of TNMP first mortgage bonds.  The TNMP Revolving Credit Facility matures on September 18, 2018.  PNM also has the   $50.0 million   PNM New Mexico Credit Facility that expires on January 8, 2018.  At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate was   1.78%   for the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility,   1.66%   for the PNM Revolving Credit Facility,   1.68%   for the PNM New Mexico Credit Facility, and   1.38%   for borrowings outstanding under the   twelve  -month   $150.0 million   PNMR Term Loan Agreement, which matures in December 2016.  Short-term debt outstanding consisted of: 

In addition to the above borrowings, PNMR, PNM, and TNMP had letters of credit outstanding of   $36.5 million  ,   $2.5 million  , and   $0.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   that reduce the available capacity under their respective revolving credit facilities. 
    
  At   October 21, 2016  , PNMR, PNM, and TNMP had   $100.4 million  ,   $373.5 million  , and   $74.9 million   of availability under their respective revolving credit facilities, including reductions of availability due to outstanding letters of credit, and PNM had   $44.0 million   of availability under the PNM New Mexico Credit Facility.  Total availability at   October 21, 2016  , on a consolidated basis, was   $592.8 million   for PNMR.  As of   October 21, 2016  , PNM and TNMP had   no   borrowings from PNMR under intercompany loan agreements.  At   October 21, 2016  , PNMR, PNM, and TNMP had consolidated invested cash of   $1.8 million  ,   none  , and   $0.3 million  .

  Overview   
  There are various claims and lawsuits pending against the Company.  The Company also is subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations and periodically participates in the investigation and remediation of various sites.  In addition, the Company periodically enters into financial commitments in connection with its business operations.  Also, the Company is involved in various legal and regulatory (Note 12) proceedings in the normal course of its business.  It is not possible at this time for the Company to determine fully the effect of all litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

With respect to some of the items listed below, the Company has determined that a loss is not probable or that, to the extent probable, cannot be reasonably estimated.  In some cases, the Company is not able to predict with any degree of certainty the range of possible loss that could be incurred.  Nevertheless, the Company assesses legal and regulatory matters based on current information and makes judgments concerning their potential outcome, giving due consideration to the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of any damages sought, and the probability of success.  Such judgments are made with the understanding that the outcome of any litigation, investigation, or other legal proceeding is inherently uncertain.  In accordance with GAAP, the Company records liabilities for matters where it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable.  The actual outcomes of the items listed below could ultimately differ from the judgments made and the differences could be material.  The Company cannot make any assurances that the amount of reserves or potential insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover the cash obligations that might be incurred as a result of litigation or regulatory proceedings.  Except as otherwise disclosed, the Company does not expect that any known lawsuits, environmental costs, and commitments will have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
  Additional information concerning commitments and contingencies is contained in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K. 
    
  Commitments and Contingencies Related to the Environment 
    
  Nuclear Spent Fuel and Waste Disposal  
    
  Nuclear power plant operators are required to enter into spent fuel disposal contracts with the DOE that require the DOE to accept and dispose of all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive wastes generated by domestic power reactors.  Although the Nuclear Waste Policy Act required the DOE to develop a permanent repository for the storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel by 1998, the DOE announced that it would not be able to open the repository by 1998 and sought to excuse its performance of these requirements.  In November 1997, the DC Circuit issued a decision preventing the DOE from excusing its own delay, but refused to order the DOE to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel.  Based on this decision and the DOE s delay, a number of utilities, including APS (on behalf of itself and the other PVNGS owners, including PNM), filed damages actions against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims.  The lawsuits filed by APS alleged that damages were incurred due to DOE s continuing failure to remove spent nuclear fuel and high level waste from PVNGS.  In August 2014, APS and DOE entered into a settlement agreement, which establishes a process for the payment of claims for costs incurred through December 31, 2016.  Under the settlement agreement, APS must submit claims annually for payment of allowable costs.  In the first quarter of 2015, PNM recorded   $4.3 million  , including   $3.1 million   credited back to PNM s customers, for its share of the settlement under this process for costs incurred from July 2011 through June 2014.  PNM now records estimated claims quarterly.  The settlement agreement terminates upon payment of costs incurred through December 31, 2016, unless extended by mutual written agreement. 
    
  PNM estimates that it will incur approximately   $58.0 million   (in 2013 dollars) for its share of the costs related to the on-site interim storage of spent nuclear fuel at PVNGS during the term of the operating licenses.  PNM accrues these costs as a component of fuel expense as the fuel is consumed.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , PNM had a liability for interim storage costs of   $12.0 million   and   $12.2 million   included in other deferred credits.  
    
  PVNGS has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period, which ends in December 2027.  Additionally, PVNGS has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation, which ends in November 2047.  If uncertainties regarding the United States government s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved, APS will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the ISFSI to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation. 
    
  On June 8, 2012, the DC Circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the NRC s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel.  The petitioners had challenged the NRC s 2010 update to the agency s Waste Confidence Decision and temporary storage rule (the  Waste Confidence Decision ).  The DC Circuit found that the Waste Confidence Decision update constituted a major federal action, which, consistent with NEPA, requires either an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact from the NRC s actions.  The DC Circuit found that the NRC s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient

and, therefore, remanded the Waste Confidence Decision update for further action consistent with NEPA.  On September 6, 2012, the NRC commissioners issued a directive to the NRC staff to proceed with development of a generic EIS to support an updated Waste Confidence Decision.  
  In September 2013, the NRC issued its draft generic EIS to support an updated Waste Confidence Decision.  On August 26, 2014, the NRC approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel.  The continued storage rule adopted the findings of the generic EIS regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor s licensed period of operations.  As a result, those generic impacts do not need to be re-analyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses.  The NRC lifted its suspension on final licensing actions on all nuclear power plant licenses and renewals that went into effect when the DC Circuit issued its June 2012 decision although PVNGS had not been involved in any licensing actions affected by that decision.  The August 2014 final rule has been subject to continuing legal challenges before the NRC and the United States Court of Appeals.  PNM is unable to predict the outcome of this matter. 
  In 2011, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the Nuclear Energy Institute challenged DOE s 2010 determination of the adequacy of the one tenth of a cent per KWh fee (the  one-mill fee ) paid by the nation s commercial nuclear power plant owners pursuant to their individual contracts with the DOE.  On May 16, 2014, the DOE adjusted the fee to   zero  .  PNM anticipates challenges to this action and is unable to predict its ultimate outcome. 
    
  The Clean Air Act 
    
  Regional Haze    
    
  In 1999, EPA developed a regional haze program and regional haze rules under the CAA.  The rule directs each of the   50   states to address regional haze.  Pursuant to the CAA, states have the primary role to regulate visibility requirements by promulgating SIPs.  States are required to establish goals for improving visibility in national parks and wilderness areas (also known as Class I areas) and to develop long-term strategies for reducing emissions of air pollutants that cause visibility impairment in their own states and for preventing degradation in other states.  States must establish a series of interim goals to ensure continued progress.  The first planning period specifies setting reasonable progress goals for improving visibility in Class I areas by the year 2018.  In July 2005, EPA promulgated its final regional haze rule guidelines for states to conduct BART determinations for certain covered facilities, including utility boilers, built between 1962 and 1977 that have the potential to emit more than   250   tons per year of visibility impairing pollution.  If it is demonstrated that the emissions from these sources cause or contribute to visibility impairment in any Class I area, then BART must be installed by 2018. 
    
  SJGS  
    
  BART Compliance         SJGS is a source that is subject to the statutory obligations of the CAA to reduce visibility impacts.  Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K contains detailed information concerning the BART compliance process, including interactions with governmental agencies responsible for environmental oversight and the NMPRC approval process.  In December 2015, PNM received NMPRC approval for the plan to comply with the EPA regional haze rule at SJGS.  Under the approved plan, the installation of selective non-catalytic reduction technology ( SNCR ) was required on SJGS Units 1 and 4, which was completed in early 2016, and Units 2 and 3 are to be retired by the end of 2017.  In addition to the required SNCR equipment, the NSR permit, which was required to be obtained in order to install the SNCRs, specified that SJGS Units 1 and 4 be converted to balanced draft technology ( BDT ).  PNM s share of the total costs for SNCRs and BDT equipment was   $76.8 million  .  See Note 12 for information concerning the NMPRC s treatment of BDT in PNM s NM 2015 Rate Case.  Although operating costs will be reduced due to the retirement of SJGS Units 2 and 3, the operating costs for SJGS Units 1 and 4 will increase with the installation of SNCR and BDT equipment. 
  On December 16, 2015, following oral argument, the NMPRC issued a final order regarding SJGS.  As provided in that order:  

PNM will retire SJGS Units 2 and 3 (PNM s current ownership interest totals   418   MW) at December 31, 2017 and recover, over   20   years,   50%   of their undepreciated net book value at that date and earn a regulated return on those costs 
                
    PNM is granted a CCN to acquire an additional   132   MW in SJGS Unit 4, with an initial book value of   zero  , plus the costs of SNCR and other capital additions

PNM is granted a CCN for   134   MW of PVNGS Unit 3 with an initial rate base value equal to the book value as of December 31, 2017, including transmission assets associated with PVNGS Unit 3, (estimated to aggregate approximately   $152 million  ) 
                
    No later than December 31, 2018, and before entering into a binding agreement for post-2022 coal supply for SJGS, PNM will file its position and supporting testimony in a NMPRC case to determine the extent to which SJGS should continue serving PNM s retail customers  needs after mid-2022; all parties to the stipulation agree to support this case being decided within   six   months (to facilitate the 2018 filing, PNM anticipates developing two resource portfolios in its 2017 IRP to be filed in July 2017, one with SJGS continuing beyond mid-2022 and one where it is shutdown) 
                
    PNM is authorized to acquire   65   MW of SJGS Unit 4 as excluded utility plant; PNM and PNMR commit that no further coal-fired merchant plant will be acquired at any time by PNM, PNMR, or any PNM affiliate; PNM is not precluded from seeking a CCN to include the   65   MW or other coal capacity in rate base 
                
    Beginning January 1, 2020, for every MWh produced by   197   MW of coal-fired generation from PNM s ownership share of SJGS, PNM will acquire and retire   one   MWh of RECs or allowances that include a zero-CO   2    emission attribute compliant with EPA s Clean Power Plan; this REC retirement is in addition to what is required to meet the RPS; the cost of these RECs are to be capped at   $7.0 million   per year and will be recovered in rates; PNM should purchase EPA-compliant RECs from New Mexico renewable generation unless those RECs are more costly 
                
    PNM will accelerate recovery of SNCR costs on SJGS Units 1 and 4 so that the costs are fully recovered by July 1, 2022 (cost recovery for PNM s BDT project is discussed in Note 12)  
                
    PNM will not recover approximately   $20 million   of other costs incurred in connection with CAA compliance 
                
    PNM s 2014 IRP docket will be closed without other NMPRC action 
       
  At December 31, 2015, PNM estimated the undepreciated net book value of SJGS Units 2 and 3 at December 31, 2017 would be approximately   $255.3 million  ,   50%   of which would be recovered over a   20   year period, including a return on the unrecovered amount at PNM s WACC.  At December 31, 2015, PNM recorded a   $127.6 million   regulatory disallowance to reflect the write-off of the   50%   of the estimated December 31, 2017 net book value that will not be recovered.  The ultimate amount of the disallowance will be dependent on the actual December 31, 2017 net book values of SJGS Units 2 and 3.  Accordingly, the amount initially recorded will be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the projected December 31, 2017 net book values.  At December 31, 2015, PNM recorded losses for regulatory disallowances and restructuring costs, aggregating   $165.7 million  , reflecting the above disallowance, the other unrecoverable costs, and the   $16.5 million   increase in the estimated liability recorded for coal mine reclamation resulting from the new coal mine reclamation arrangement entered into in conjunction with the new coal supply agreement ( CSA ).  Additional information about the CSA is discussed under Coal Supply below and in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.   
    
  In the three months ended March 31, 2016, PNM revised its estimates of the December 31, 2017 projected book value of SJGS Units 2 and 3 and the other unrecoverable costs, which resulted in an expense of   $0.8 million   that is reflected in regulatory disallowances and restructuring costs on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  In addition, PNMR Development recorded an expense of   $0.6 million   for costs it was obligated to reimburse the other SJGS participants under the restructuring arrangement, which is included in other deductions on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  In the three months ended September 30, 2016, PNM recorded   $5.2 million   of additional regulatory disallowances and restructuring costs, including   $4.8 million   related to a refinement of the estimated liability for coal mine reclamation resulting from the new coal mine reclamation arrangement and   $0.4 million   from a further revision of estimated December 31, 2017 projected book value of SJGS Units 2 and 3 and the other unrecoverable costs.  At September 30, 2016, the carrying value for PNM s current ownership share of SJGS Units 2 and 3 is comprised of plant in service of   $471.6 million   and accumulated depreciation and amortization of   $201.4 million   for a net undepreciated book value of   $270.2 million  , offset by   50%   (which equals   $128.6 million  ) of the anticipated December 31, 2017 undepreciated net book value of SJGS Units 2 and 3 that will not be recovered, resulting in the net carrying value for SJGS Units 2 and 3 being   $141.6 million   at September 30, 2016.   
    
  On January 14, 2016, NEE filed, with the NM Supreme Court, a Notice of Appeal of the NMPRC s December 16, 2015 order.  On July 22, 2016, NEE filed a brief alleging that the NMPRC s decision violated NM Statutes and NMPRC regulations because PNM did not adequately consider replacement resources other than those proposed by PNM, the NMPRC did not require PNM to adequately address and mitigate ratepayer risk, the NMPRC unlawfully shifted the burden of proof, and the NMPRC s decision was arbitrary and capricious.  PNM s response brief is due November 2, 2016.  In addition, on February 5, 2016, NEE filed, with the NMPRC, a motion for reconsideration of that final order based on developments related to the loan made by NM

Capital to facilitate the sale of SJCC, which is described under Coal Supply below.  NEE alleged the loan is a transaction that, under the New Mexico Public Utility Act, requires prior NMPRC approval.  PNM filed its response to NEE s motion for reconsideration on February 18, 2016.  The NEE motion was denied by operation of law because the NMPRC did not act on the motion.  On March 31, 2016, NEE filed, with the NMPRC, a complaint against PNM regarding the financing provided by NM Capital to facilitate the sale of SJCC.  The complaint alleges that PNM failed to comply with its discovery obligation in the SJGS abandonment case and requests the NMPRC to investigate whether the financing transactions could adversely affect PNM s ability to provide electric service to its retail customers.  PNM responded to the complaint on May 4, 2016.  The NMPRC has taken no action on this matter.  PNM cannot currently predict the outcome of these matters.  
    
  SJGS Ownership Restructuring Matters     As discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, SJGS currently is jointly owned by PNM and   eight   other entities.  In connection with the proposed retirement of SJGS Units 2 and 3, some of the SJGS participants expressed a desire to exit their ownership in the plant.  As a result, the SJGS participants negotiated a restructuring of the ownership in SJGS and addressed the obligations of the exiting participants for plant decommissioning, mine reclamation, environmental matters, and certain future operating costs, among other items.  
    
  Following mediated negotiations, the SJGS participants executed the San Juan Project Restructuring Agreement ( RA ) on July 31, 2015.  The RA provides the essential terms of restructured ownership and addresses other related matters, including that the exiting participants remain obligated for their proportionate shares of environmental, mine reclamation, and certain other legacy liabilities that are attributable to activities that occurred prior to their exit.  PNMR Development became a party to the RA and agreed to acquire a   65   MW ownership interest in SJGS Unit 4 on the exit date, which is anticipated to be December 31, 2017, but has obligations related to Unit 4 before then.  On the exit date, PNM and PNMR Development would acquire   132   MW and   65   MW of the capacity in SJGS Unit 4 from the exiting owners for no initial cost other than funding capital improvements, including the costs of installing SNCR and BDT equipment.  PNMR currently anticipates that PNMR Development would transfer the rights and obligations related to the   65   MW to PNM prior to December 31, 2017 in order to facilitate dispatch of power from that capacity.  As ordered by the NMPRC, PNM would treat the   65   MW as merchant utility plant that would be excluded from retail rates.  
    
  The RA became effective contemporaneously with the effectiveness of the new CSA.  The effectiveness of the new CSA was dependent on the closing of the purchase of the existing coal mine operation by a new mine operator, which as discussed in Coal Supply below, occurred at 11:59 PM on January 31, 2016.  The RA sets forth the terms under which PNM acquired the coal inventory of the exiting SJGS participants as of January 1, 2016 and will supply coal to the exiting participants for the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017, which arrangement provides economic benefits that are being passed on to PNM s customers through the FPPAC.   
    
  Other SJGS Matters     Although the RA results in an agreement among the SJGS participants enabling compliance with current CAA requirements, it is possible that the financial impact of climate change regulation or legislation, other environmental regulations, the result of litigation, and other business considerations, could jeopardize the economic viability of SJGS or the ability or willingness of individual participants to continue participation in the plant. 
    
  Four Corners  
    
  On August 6, 2012, EPA issued its Four Corners FIP with a final BART determination for Four Corners.  The rule included   two   compliance alternatives.  On December 30, 2013, APS notified EPA that the Four Corners participants selected the alternative that required APS to permanently close Units 1-3 by January 1, 2014 and install SCR post-combustion NOx controls on each of Units 4 and 5 by July 31, 2018.  PNM owns a   13%   interest in Units 4 and 5, but had   no   ownership interest in Units 1-3, which were shut down by APS on December 30, 2013.  For particulate matter emissions, EPA is requiring Units 4 and 5 to meet an emission limit of   0.015   lb/MMBTU and the plant to meet a   20%   opacity limit, both of which are achievable through operation of the existing baghouses.  Although unrelated to BART, the final BART rule also imposes a   20%   opacity limitation on certain fugitive dust emissions from Four Corners  coal and material handling operations.   
  PNM estimates its share of costs for post-combustion controls at Four Corners Units 4 and 5 to be up to   $90.1 million  , including amounts incurred through September 30, 2016 and PNM s AFUDC.  PNM will seek recovery from its ratepayers of all costs that are ultimately incurred.  PNM is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter.

The Four Corners participants  obligations to comply with EPA s final BART determinations, coupled with the financial impact of climate change regulation or legislation, other environmental regulations, and other business considerations, could jeopardize the economic viability of Four Corners or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in Four Corners.  
    
  Four Corners Federal Agency Lawsuit     On December 21, 2015, several environmental groups filed a notice of intent to sue the OSM and other federal agencies under the ESA, alleging that OSM s reliance on the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement prepared in connection with a federal environmental review was not in accordance with applicable law.  The environmental review was undertaken as part of the DOI s review process necessary to allow for the effectiveness of lease amendments and related rights-of-way renewals for Four Corners.  This review process also required separate environmental impact evaluations under NEPA and culminated in the issuance of a Record of Decision justifying the agency action extending the life of the plant and the adjacent mine. 
    
  On April 20, 2016, the same environmental groups filed a lawsuit against OSM and other federal agencies in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona.  Expanding upon the December 2015 ESA notice, the lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both the ESA and NEPA in providing the federal approvals necessary to extend operations at Four Corners and the adjacent mine past July 6, 2016.  The court granted APS  motion to intervene in the litigation on August 3, 2016.  Briefing on the merits of this litigation is expected to extend through May 2017.  On September 15, 2016, the Navajo Transitional Energy Company, LLC ( NTEC ), the current owner of the mine providing coal to Four Corners, filed a motion to intervene for the purpose of dismissing the lawsuit based on NTEC s tribal sovereign immunity.  PNM cannot predict the timing or outcome of this matter.  
    
  Carbon Dioxide Emissions 
  On August 3, 2015, EPA established final standards to limit CO   2    emissions from power plants.  EPA took   three   separate but related actions in which it: (1) established the final carbon pollution standards for new, modified and reconstructed power plants; (2) established the final Clean Power Plan to set standards for carbon emission reductions from existing power plants; and (3) released a proposed federal plan associated with the final Clean Power Plan.  The Clean Power Plan was published on October 23, 2015.  Multiple states, utilities, and trade groups subsequently filed petitions for review and motions to stay in the DC Circuit.  
    
  The Clean Power Plan establishes state-by-state targets for carbon emissions reduction and establishes deadlines for states to submit initial plans to EPA by September 6, 2016, with a potential   two  -year extension, and final plans by 2018.  Those deadlines will be adjusted due to the stay of the Clean Power Plan issued by the US Supreme Court and pending litigation described below.  State plans can be based on either an emission standards (rate or mass) approach or a state measures approach.  Under an emission standards approach, federally enforceable emission limits are placed directly on affected units in the state.  A state measures approach must meet equivalent rates statewide, but may include some elements, such as renewable energy or energy efficiency requirements, that are not federally enforceable.  State measures plans may only be used with mass-based goals and must include  backstop  federally enforceable standards that will become effective if the state measures fail to achieve the expected level of emission reductions.  
    
  On January 21, 2016, the DC Circuit denied petitions to stay the Clean Power Plan.  On January 26, 2016,   29   states and state agencies filed a petition to the US Supreme Court asking the court to reverse the DC Circuit s decision and stay the implementation of the Clean Power Plan.  On February 9, 2016, the US Supreme Court granted the applications to stay the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review of the rule.  The US Supreme Court issued a one-page order that stated,  The EPA rule to have states cut power sector carbon dioxide (CO   2   ) emissions   32%   by 2030 is stayed pending disposition of the applicants  petitions for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.   The vote was 5-4 among the US Supreme Court Justices. The decision means the Clean Power Plan is not in effect and states are not obliged to comply with its requirements.  If the rule prevails through the legal challenges, states will be able to resume preparing state plans where they left off and may still have   six   more months to prepare initial plans and   2.5   years for final plans.  The DC Circuit heard oral arguments on September 27, 2016 in the case challenging the Clean Power Plan.  A decision by the DC Circuit is not expected until sometime in 2017.  The stay will remain in effect pending US Supreme Court review if such review is sought.

The proposed federal plan released concurrently with the Clean Power Plan is important to Four Corners and the Navajo Nation.  Since the Navajo Nation does not have primacy over its air quality program, the EPA would be the regulatory authority responsible for implementing the Clean Power Plan on the Navajo Nation.  In addition, the proposed rule recommends that EPA determine it is  necessary or appropriate  for EPA to regulate CO   2    emissions on the Navajo Nation.  The comment period for the proposed rule closed on January 21, 2016.  APS and PNM filed separate comments with EPA on EPA s draft plan and model trading rules, advocating that such a federal plan is neither necessary nor appropriate to protect air quality on the Navajo Nation.  If EPA was to determine that it was  not necessary or appropriate , then the Clean Power Plan would not apply to the Navajo Nation, in which case, APS has indicated the Clean Power Plan would not have a material impact on Four Corners.  PNM is unable to predict the financial or operational impacts on Four Corners operations if EPA determines that a federal plan is necessary or appropriate for the Navajo Nation.   
    
  On June 30, 2016, EPA published in the Federal Register the design details of its voluntary Clean Energy Incentive Program under the Clean Power Plan.  The due date for comments to EPA on the program has been extended to November 1, 2016. 
    
  PNM s review of the new CO   2    emission reductions standards is ongoing and the assessment of its impacts will depend on the outcome of the judicial and regulatory proceedings.  Accordingly, PNM cannot predict the impact these standards may have on its operations or a range of the potential costs of compliance. 
    
  National Ambient Air Quality Standards ( NAAQS )  
  The CAA requires EPA to set NAAQS for pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment.  EPA has set NAAQS for certain pollutants, including NOx, SO   2   ,       ozone, and particulate matter.  In 2010, EPA updated the primary NOx and SO   2    NAAQS to include a 1-hour maximum standard while retaining the annual standards for NOx and SO   2    and the 24-hour SO   2    standard.  New Mexico is in attainment for the 1-hour NOx NAAQS.  On May 13, 2014, EPA released the draft data requirements rule for the 1-hour SO   2    NAAQS, which directs state and tribal air agencies to characterize current air quality in areas with large SO   2    sources to identify maximum 1-hour SO   2    concentrations.  The proposed rule also describes the process and timetable by which air regulatory agencies would characterize air quality around large SO   2    sources through ambient monitoring or modeling.  This characterization will result in these areas being designated as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassified for compliance with the 1-hour SO   2    NAAQS.  On March 2, 2015, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California approved a settlement that imposes deadlines for EPA to identify areas that violate the NAAQS standards for 1-hour SO   2    emissions.  The settlement results from a lawsuit brought by Earthjustice on behalf of the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council under the CAA.  The consent decree requires the following: (1) within   16   months of the consent decree entry, EPA must issue area designations for areas containing non-retiring facilities that either emitted more than   16,000   tons of SO   2    in 2012 or emitted more than   2,600   tons with an emission rate of   0.45   lbs/MMBTU or higher in 2012; (2) by December 2017, EPA must issue designations for areas for which states have not adopted a new monitoring network under the proposed data requirements rule; and (3) by December 2020, EPA must issue designations for areas for which states have adopted a new monitoring network under the proposed data requirements rule.  SJGS and Four Corners SO   2    emissions are below the tonnages set forth in 1) above.  EPA regions sent letters to state environmental agencies explaining how EPA plans to implement the consent decree.  The letters outline the schedule that EPA expects states to follow in moving forward with new SO   2    non-attainment designations.  NMED did not receive a letter.  
    
  On August 11, 2015, EPA released the Data Requirements Rule for SO   2   , telling states how to model or monitor to determine attainment or nonattainment with the new 1-hour SO   2    NAAQS.  On June 3, 2016, NMED notified PNM that air quality modeling results indicated that SJGS was in compliance with the standard.  The next compliance date is in January 2017, when NMED will submit their formal modeling report and recommendations regarding attainment status to EPA.  Thereafter, every July, NMED must submit a report to EPA documenting annual SO   2    emissions from SJGS and the associated compliance status. 
    
  EPA finalized revisions to its NAAQS for fine particulate matter on December 14, 2012.  PNM believes the equipment modifications required under its amended NSR air permit for the installation of SNCRs and installation of BDT equipment to reduce fugitive emissions, including NOx, SO   2    and particulate matter, will assist the plant in complying with the particulate matter NAAQS. 
    
  In January 2010, EPA announced it would strengthen the 8-hour ozone standard by setting a new standard in a range of   60  -  70   parts per billion ( ppb ).  On October 1, 2015, EPA finalized the new ozone NAAQS and lowered both the primary and

secondary 8-hour standard from   75   ppb to   70   ppb.  With ozone standards becoming more stringent, fossil-fueled generation units will come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of NOx and volatile organic compounds and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in nonattainment areas.     
    
  On November 10, 2015, EPA proposed a rule revising its Exceptional Events Rule, which outlines the requirements for excluding air quality data (including ozone data) from regulatory decisions if the data are affected by events outside an area s control.  The proposed rule is timely in light of the new more stringent ozone NAAQS final rule since western states like New Mexico and Arizona are particularly subject to elevated background ozone transport from natural local sources, such as wildfires, and transported via winds from distant sources, such as the stratosphere or another region or country. 
    
  On February 25, 2016, EPA released guidance on area designations, which states will use to determine their initial designation recommendations by October 1, 2016.  EPA recommends that states and tribes use the   three   most recent years of quality assured monitoring data available (e.g., 2013 to 2015) to recommend designations.  States and tribes may also have preliminary 2016 data that may be used.  EPA will release final designations of attainment/nonattainment for areas by October 1, 2017.  By October 2018, NMED must submit an infrastructure SIP that provides the basic air quality management program to implement the revised ozone standard.  Due dates for SIPs for areas that have been designated as non-attainment for ozone are generally due within   36   months from the date of designation and are expected to be submitted to EPA by October 1, 2020. 
    
  NMED published their 2015 Ozone NAAQS Designation Recommendation Report on September 2, 2016.  In New Mexico, NMED is designating only a small area in southern Dona Ana County as non-attainment for ozone.  NMED will have responsibility for bringing this nonattainment area into compliance and will look at all sources of NOx and volatile organic compounds since these are the pollutants that form ground-level ozone.       According to NMED s website,  If emissions from Mexico keep New Mexico from meeting the standards, the New Mexico area could remain nonattainment but would not face more stringent requirements over time . 
    
  PNM does not believe there will be material impacts to its facilities as a result of NMED s nonattainment designation of the small area within Dona Ana County, but must wait on EPA s ultimate approval, which should occur by October 1, 2017.  Until EPA approves attainment designations for the Navajo Nation and releases a proposal to implement the revised ozone NAAQS, APS is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on Four Corners.  PNM cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  
    
  Four Corners Coal Mine 
    
  In 2012, several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in federal district court against the OSM challenging OSM s 2012 approval of a permit revision which allowed for the expansion of mining operations into a new area of the mine that serves Four Corners ( Area IV North ).  In April 2015, the court issued an order invalidating the permit revision, thereby prohibiting mining in Area IV North until OSM took action to cure the defect in its permitting process identified by the court.  The owner of the mine appealed to the Tenth Circuit.  On December 29, 2015, OSM took action to cure the defect in its permitting process by issuing a revised environmental assessment with a finding of no new significant impact and reissued the permit.  On March 30, 2016, the Tenth Circuit vacated and dismissed the appeal on mootness grounds due to OSM s revised environmental assessment and reapproval of the permit at issue.  
    
  WEG v. OSM NEPA Lawsuit 
    
  In February 2013, WEG filed a Petition for Review in the United States District Court of Colorado against OSM challenging federal administrative decisions affecting   seven   different mines in   four   states issued at various times from 2007 through 2012.  In its petition, WEG challenges several unrelated mining plan modification approvals, which were each separately approved by OSM.  Of the   fifteen   claims for relief in the WEG Petition,   two   concern SJCC s San Juan mine.  WEG s allegations concerning the San Juan mine arise from OSM administrative actions in 2008.  WEG alleges various NEPA violations against OSM, including, but not limited to, OSM s alleged failure to provide requisite public notice and participation, alleged failure to analyze certain environmental impacts, and alleged reliance on outdated and insufficient documents.  WEG s petition seeks various forms of relief, including a finding that the federal defendants violated NEPA by approving the mine plans; voiding, reversing, and remanding the various mining modification approvals; enjoining the federal defendants from re-issuing the mining plan approvals for the mines

until compliance with NEPA has been demonstrated; and enjoining operations at the   seven   mines.  SJCC intervened in this matter.  The court granted SJCC s motion to sever its claims from the lawsuit and transfer venue to the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico.  In February 2016, venue for this matter was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.  A stay in this matter expired on April 1, 2016 and was not renewed although the parties continued to engage in settlement negotiations.   On August 31, 2016, the court entered an order remanding the matter back to OSM for the completion of an EIS.  The EIS is to be completed by August 31, 2019.  The court ruled that mining operations may continue in the interim and the litigation will be administratively closed.  If OSM does not complete the EIS within the time frame provided, the court will order immediate   vacatur   of the mining plan at issue.  The scope of the EIS will be determined through a public process and is expected to include cumulative and indirect effects of surrounding sources.    PNM cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter.  
  Navajo Nation Environmental Issues  
  Four Corners is located on the Navajo Reservation and is held under an easement granted by the federal government, as well as a lease from the Navajo Nation.  The Navajo Acts purport to give the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality, drinking water, and pesticide activities, including those activities that occur at Four Corners.  In October 1995, the Four Corners participants filed a lawsuit in the District Court of the Navajo Nation challenging the applicability of the Navajo Acts to Four Corners.  In May 2005, APS and the Navajo Nation signed an agreement resolving the dispute regarding the Navajo Nation s authority to adopt operating permit regulations under the Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act.  As a result of this agreement, APS sought, and the courts granted, dismissal of the pending litigation in the Navajo Nation Supreme Court and the Navajo Nation District Court, to the extent the claims relate to the CAA.  The agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other aspects of the Navajo Acts.  PNM cannot currently predict the outcome of these matters or the range of their potential impacts. 
  Cooling Water Intake Structures   
  EPA signed its final cooling water intake structures rule on May 16, 2014, which establishes national standards for certain cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and other facilities under the Clean Water Act to protect fish and other aquatic organisms by minimizing impingement mortality (the capture of aquatic wildlife on intake structures or against screens) and entrainment mortality (the capture of fish or shellfish in water flow entering and passing through intake structures).  The final rule was published on August 15, 2014 and became effective October 14, 2014.  
  The final rule allows multiple compliance options and considerations for site specific conditions and the permit writer is granted a significant amount of discretion in determining permit requirements, schedules, and conditions.  To minimize impingement mortality, the rule provides operators of facilities, such as SJGS and Four Corners,   seven   options for meeting Best Technology Available ( BTA ) standards for reducing impingement.  SJGS has a closed-cycle recirculating cooling system, which is a listed BTA and may also qualify for the  de minimis rate of impingement  based on the design of the intake structure.  To minimize entrainment mortality, the permitting authority must establish the BTA for entrainment on a site-specific basis, taking into consideration an array of factors, including endangered species and social costs and benefits.  Affected sources must submit source water baseline characterization data to the permitting authority to assist in the determination.  Compliance deadlines under the rule are tied to permit renewal and will be subject to a schedule of compliance established by the permitting authority.   
  The rule is not clear as to how it applies and what the compliance timelines are for facilities like SJGS that have a cooling water intake structure and only a multi-sector general stormwater permit.  PNM has been in discussion with EPA regarding this issue. However, PNM does not expect material changes as a result of any requirements that may be imposed upon SJGS.  APS is currently in discussions with EPA Region 9, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ( NPDES ) permit writer for Four Corners, to determine the scope of the impingement and entrainment requirements, which will, in turn, determine APS s costs to comply with the rule.  APS has indicated that it does not expect such costs to be material.  
    
  Effluent Limitation Guidelines 
    
  On June 7, 2013, EPA published proposed revised wastewater effluent limitation guidelines establishing technology-based wastewater discharge limitations for fossil fuel-fired electric power plants.  EPA s proposal offered numerous options that target metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities, scrubber activities,

and non-chemical metal cleaning waste operations.  All proposed alternatives establish a  zero discharge  effluent limit for all pollutants in fly ash transport water.  Requirements governing bottom ash transport water differ depending on which alternative EPA ultimately chooses and could range from effluent limits based on Best Available Technology Economically Achievable to  zero discharge  effluent limits.   
    
  EPA signed the final Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines Rule on September 30, 2015.  The final rule, which became effective on January 4, 2016, phases in the new, more stringent requirements in the form of effluent limits for arsenic, mercury, selenium, and nitrogen for wastewater discharged from wet scrubber systems and zero discharge of pollutants in ash transport water that must be incorporated into plants  NPDES permits.  Each plant must comply between 2018 and 2023 depending on when it needs a new/revised NPDES permit. 
    
  Because SJGS is zero discharge for wastewater and is not required to hold a NPDES permit, it is expected that minimal to   no   requirements will be imposed.  Reeves Station, a PNM-owned gas-fired generating station, discharges cooling tower blowdown to a publicly owned treatment works and holds an NPDES permit.  It is expected that minimum to   no   requirements will be imposed at Reeves. 
    
  Based upon the requirements of the final Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines Rule, Four Corners may be required to change equipment and operating practices affecting boilers and ash handling systems, as well as change its waste disposal techniques.  Until a draft NPDES permit is proposed for Four Corners, APS is uncertain what will be required to comply with the finalized effluent limitations.  PNM is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or a range of the potential costs of compliance.   
  Santa Fe Generating Station   
  PNM and the NMED are parties to agreements under which PNM installed a remediation system to treat water from a City of Santa Fe municipal supply well, an extraction well, and monitoring wells to address gasoline contamination in the groundwater at the site of PNM s former Santa Fe Generating Station and service center.  PNM believes the observed groundwater contamination originated from off-site sources, but agreed to operate the remediation facilities until the groundwater meets applicable federal and state standards or until the NMED determines that additional remediation is not required, whichever is earlier.  The City of Santa Fe has indicated that since the City no longer needs the water from the well, the City would prefer to discontinue its operation and maintain it only as a backup water source.   However, for PNM s groundwater remediation system to operate, the water well must be in service.  Currently, PNM is not able to assess the duration of this project or estimate the impact on its obligations if the City of Santa Fe ceases to operate the water well.  
    
  The Superfund Oversight Section of the NMED also has conducted multiple investigations into the chlorinated solvent plume in the vicinity of the site of the former Santa Fe Generating Station.  In February 2008, a NMED site inspection report was submitted to EPA, which states that neither the source nor extent of contamination has been determined and that the source may not be the former Santa Fe Generating Station.  Results of tests conducted by NMED in April 2012 and April 2013 showed elevated concentrations of nitrate in   three   monitoring wells and an increase in free-phase hydrocarbons in another well.  PNM conducted similar site-wide sampling activities in April 2014 and obtained results similar to the 2013 data.  As part of this effort, PNM also collected a sample of hydrocarbon product for  fingerprint  analysis from a monitoring well located on the northeastern corner of the property.  This analysis indicated that the hydrocarbon product was a mixture of newer and older fuels, and the location of the monitoring well suggests that the hydrocarbon product is likely from offsite sources.  PNM does not believe the former generating station is the source of the increased levels of free-phase hydrocarbons, but no conclusive determinations have been made.  However, it is possible that PNM s prior activities to remediate hydrocarbon contamination, as conducted under an NMED-approved plan, may have resulted in increased nitrate levels.  Therefore, PNM has agreed to monitor nitrate levels in a limited number of wells under the terms of the renewed discharge permit for the former generating station.  PNM is unable to predict the outcome of these matters. 
    
  Effective December 22, 2015, PNM and NMED entered into a memorandum of understanding to address changing groundwater quality conditions at the site.  Under the memorandum, PNM will continue gasoline remediation of the site under the supervision of NMED and qualified costs of the work will be eligible for payment through the New Mexico Corrective Action Fund ( CAF ), which is administered by the NMED Petroleum Storage Tank Bureau.  Among other things, money in the CAF is available to NMED to make payments to or on behalf of owners and operators for corrective action taken in accordance with

statutory and regulatory requirements to investigate, minimize, eliminate, or clean up a release.   PNM s work plan and cost estimates for specific groundwater remediation tasks were approved by the Petroleum Storage Tank Bureau.  PNM submitted a monitoring plan consisting of a compilation of the data associated with the recent monitoring activities conducted under the CAF to NMED on October 3, 2016.  Following review of the data by NMED, PNM, and NMED will develop plans for the next phase of work under the CAF. 
  Coal Combustion Byproducts Waste Disposal  
  CCBs consisting of fly ash, bottom ash, and gypsum from SJGS are currently disposed of in the surface mine pits adjacent to the plant.  SJGS does not operate any CCB impoundments or landfills.  The NMMMD currently regulates mine placement of ash at SJGS with federal oversight by the OSM.  APS disposes of CCBs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at Four Corners.  Ash management at Four Corners is regulated by EPA and the New Mexico State Engineer s Office.  
  In June 2010, EPA published a proposed rule that included   two   options for waste designation of coal ash.  One option was to regulate CCBs as a hazardous waste, which would allow EPA to create a comprehensive federal program for waste management and disposal of CCBs.  The other option was to regulate CCBs as a non-hazardous waste, which would provide EPA with the authority to develop performance standards for waste management facilities handling the CCBs and would be enforced primarily by state authorities or through citizen suits.  Both options allow for continued use of CCBs in beneficial applications.     
    
  On December 19, 2014, EPA issued its coal ash rule, including a non-hazardous waste determination for coal ash.  Coal ash will be regulated as a solid waste under Subtitle D of RCRA.  The rule sets minimum criteria for existing and new CCB landfills and existing and new CCB surface impoundments and all lateral expansions consisting of location restrictions, design and operating criteria; groundwater monitoring and corrective action; closure requirements and post closure care; and recordkeeping, notification, and internet posting requirements. 
    
  Because the rule is promulgated under Subtitle D, it does not require regulated facilities to obtain permits, does not require the states to adopt and implement the new rules, and is not within EPA s enforcement jurisdiction.  Instead, the rule s compliance mechanism is for a state or citizen group to bring a RCRA citizen suit in federal district court against any facility that is alleged to be in non-compliance with the new requirements.  EPA published the final CCB rule in the Federal Register on April 17, 2015, with an effective date of October 19, 2015.  Based upon the requirements of the final rule, PNM conducted a CCB assessment at SJGS and made minor modifications at the plant to ensure that there are no facilities which would be considered impoundments or landfills under the rule.  PNM does not expect it to have a material impact on operations, financial position, or cash flows.  
    
  As indicated above, CCBs at Four Corners are currently disposed of in ash ponds and dry storage areas.  Depending upon the results of groundwater monitoring required by the CCB rule, Four Corners may be required to take corrective action.  Initial monitoring at Four Corners is not yet complete, so expenditures related to potential corrective actions, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.  
    
  Pursuant to a June 24, 2016 order by the DC Circuit in litigation by industry and environmental groups challenging EPA s CCB regulations, within the next three years EPA is required to complete a rulemaking proceeding concerning whether or not boron must be included on the list of groundwater constituents that might trigger corrective action under EPA s CCB rules.  EPA is not required to take final action approving the inclusion of boron, but EPA must propose and consider its inclusion.  Should EPA take final action adding boron to the list of groundwater constituents that might trigger corrective action, any resulting corrective action measures may increase costs of compliance with the CCB rule at coal-fired generating facilities.  At this time, PNM cannot predict when EPA will commence its rulemaking concerning boron or the eventual results of those proceedings. 
    
  The rule s preamble indicates EPA is still evaluating whether to reverse its original regulatory determination and regulate coal ash under RCRA Subtitle C, which means it is possible at some point in the future for EPA to review the new CCB rules.  The CCB rule does not cover mine placement of coal ash.  OSM is expected to publish a proposed rule covering mine placement in 2016 and will likely be influenced by EPA s rule.  PNM cannot predict the outcome of OSM s proposed rulemaking regarding CCB regulation, including mine placement of CCBs, or whether OSM s actions will have a material impact on PNM s operations, financial position, or cash flows.   PNM would seek recovery from its ratepayers of all CCB costs that are ultimately incurred.

Other Commitments and Contingencies 
  Coal Supply  
  SJGS 
  The coal requirements for SJGS are supplied by SJCC.  Through January 31, 2016, SJCC was a wholly owned subsidiary of BHP and supplied processed coal for operation of SJGS under an underground coal sales agreement ( UG-CSA ) that was to expire on December 31, 2017.  The parties to the UG-CSA were SJCC, PNM, and Tucson.  SJCC holds certain federal, state, and private coal leases.  Under the UG-CSA, SJCC was reimbursed for all costs for mining and delivering the coal, including an allocated portion of administrative costs, and received a return on its investment.  In addition to coal delivered to meet the current needs of SJGS, PNM prepaid SJCC for certain coal mined but not yet delivered to the plant site.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, prepayments for coal, which are included in other current assets, amounted to   $54.1 million   (including amounts purchased from the existing SJGS participants discussed below) and   $49.0 million  . 
  In conjunction with the activities undertaken to comply with the CAA for SJGS, as discussed above, PNM and the other owners of SJGS evaluated alternatives for the supply of coal to SJGS after the expiration of the UG-CSA.  On July 1, 2015, PNM and Westmoreland Coal Company ( Westmoreland ) entered into a new coal supply agreement ( CSA ), pursuant to which Westmoreland will supply all of the coal requirements of SJGS through June 30, 2022.  PNM and Westmoreland also entered into agreements under which Westmoreland will provide CCB disposal and mine reclamation services.  Contemporaneous with the entry into the coal-related agreements, Westmoreland entered into a stock purchase agreement (the  Stock Purchase Agreement ) on July 1, 2015 to acquire all of the capital stock of SJCC.  In addition, PNM, Tucson, SJCC, and SJCC s owner entered into an agreement to terminate the existing UG-CSA upon the effective date of the new CSA.  
    
  The CSA became effective as of 11:59 PM on January 31, 2016, upon the closing under the Stock Purchase Agreement.  Upon closing under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Westmoreland s rights and obligations under the CSA and the agreements for CCB disposal and mine reclamation services were assigned to SJCC.  Westmoreland has guaranteed SJCC s performance under the CSA. 
    
  Pricing under the CSA is primarily fixed, adjusted to reflect general inflation.  The pricing structure takes into account that SJCC has been paid for coal mined but not delivered, as discussed above.  PNM has the option to extend the CSA, subject to negotiation of the term of the extension and compensation to the miner.  In order to extend, PNM must give written notice of that intent by July 1, 2018 and the parties must agree to the terms of the extension by January 1, 2019.  The RA sets forth terms under which PNM acquired the coal inventory of the exiting SJGS participants as of January 1, 2016 and will supply coal to the SJGS exiting participants for the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017 and to the SJGS remaining participants over the term of the CSA.  Coal costs under the CSA are significantly less than under the previous arrangement with SJCC.  Since substantially all of PNM s coal costs are passed through the FPPAC, the benefit of the reduced costs and the economic benefits of the coal inventory arrangement with the exiting owners are passed through to PNM s customers.   
    
  In support of the closing under the Stock Purchase Agreement and to facilitate PNM customer savings, NM Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of PNMR, provided funding of   $125.0 million   (the  Westmoreland Loan ) to Westmoreland San Juan, LLC ( WSJ ), a ring-fenced, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose entity that is a subsidiary of Westmoreland, to finance the purchase price of the stock of SJCC (including an insignificant affiliate) under the Stock Purchase Agreement.  NM Capital was able to provide the   $125.0 million   financing to WSJ by first entering into a   $125.0 million   term loan agreement (the  BTMU Term Loan Agreement ), among NM Capital, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. ( BTMU ), as lender, and BTMU, as Administrative Agent.  The BTMU Term Loan Agreement became effective as of February 1, 2016, has a maturity date of February 1, 2021, and bears interest at a rate based on LIBOR plus a customary spread.  In connection with the BTMU Term Loan Agreement, PNMR, as parent company of NM Capital, entered into a Guaranty Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2016, with BTMU (the  Guaranty ).  The BTMU Term Loan Agreement and the Guaranty include customary covenants, including requirements for PNMR to not exceed a maximum debt-to-capital ratio of   65%  , and customary events of default consistent with PNMR s other term loan agreements.  In addition, the BTMU Term Loan Agreement has a cross default provision and a change of control provision.  The balance outstanding under the BTMU Term Loan Agreement was   $107.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  .

The Westmoreland Loan is a   $125.0 million   loan agreement among NM Capital, as lender, WSJ, as borrower, SJCC and its affiliate, as guarantors, BTMU, as Administrative Agent, and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as Depository Bank. The Westmoreland Loan became effective as of February 1, 2016, and has a maturity date of February 1, 2021.  The Westmoreland Loan initially bears interest at a rate of   7.25%   plus LIBOR and escalates over time.  The Westmoreland Loan has been structured to encourage prepayments and early retirement of the debt.  WSJ must pay principal and interest quarterly to NM Capital in accordance with an amortization schedule.  In addition, the Westmoreland Loan requires that all cash flows of WSJ, in excess of normal operating expenses, capital additions, and operating reserves, be utilized for principal and interest payments under the loan until it is fully repaid.  At   September 30, 2016  , the amount outstanding under the Westmoreland Loan was   $110.0 million  , after the August 1, 2016 scheduled principal payment of   $15.0 million  .  The next principal payment of   $15.0 million   plus interest of   $2.3 million   is due on November 1, 2016.  As of October 21, 2016,   $17.3 million   was held in a restricted bank account that is to be used solely to service the Westmoreland Loan.  The Westmoreland Loan is secured by the assets of and the equity interests in SJCC and its affiliate.  The Westmoreland Loan also includes customary representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default.  There are   no   prepayment penalties.  
    
  In connection with certain mining permits relating to the operation of the San Juan mine, SJCC was required to post reclamation bonds of   $161.6 million   with the NMMMD.  In April 2016, NMMMD reduced SJCC s bonding requirements to   $118.7 million  .  In order to facilitate the posting of reclamation bonds by a surety on behalf of SJCC, a Reclamation Bond Agreement (the  Reclamation Bond Agreement ) was entered into by PNMR, Westmoreland, and SJCC with the surety.  In connection with the Reclamation Bond Agreement, PNMR used   $40.0 million   of the available capacity under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility to support a bank letter of credit arrangement for the benefit of the surety.  On July 19, 2016, these reclamation bonds were released by NMMMD upon acceptance of   $118.7 million   of replacement reclamation bonds from alternate surety companies, which are supported by letters of credit aggregating   $30.3 million   issued from available capacity under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility.  The Reclamation Bond Agreement was terminated effective August 3, 2016 and the prior letter of credit was surrendered and canceled.   On October 21, 2016, PNMR entered into separate letter of credit arrangements with a bank to replace the letters of credit issued from available capacity under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility.  The letters of credit issued from available capacity under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility will be surrendered and canceled upon acceptance of the replacement letters of credit by the surety companies that issued the reclamation bonds. 
    
  Four Corners 
  APS purchased all of Four Corners  coal requirements from a supplier that was also a subsidiary of BHP and had a long-term lease of coal reserves with the Navajo Nation.  That contract was to expire on July 6, 2016 with pricing determined using an escalating base-price.  On December 30, 2013, ownership of the mine was transferred to an entity owned by the Navajo Nation and a new coal supply contract for Four Corners, beginning in July 2016 and expiring in 2031, was entered into with that entity.  The BHP subsidiary is to be retained as the mine manager and operator until December 2016.  Coal costs are anticipated to increase approximately   40%   in the first year of the new contract.  The contract provides for pricing adjustments over its term based on economic indices.  PNM anticipates that its share of the increased costs will be recovered through its FPPAC. 
  Coal Mine Reclamation 
  In conjunction with the proposed shutdown of SJGS Units 2 and 3 to comply with the BART requirements of the CAA, an updated coal mine reclamation study was requested by the SJGS participants.  In 2013, PNM updated its study of the final reclamation costs for both the surface mines that previously provided coal to SJGS and the current underground mine providing coal and revised its estimates of the final reclamation costs.  This estimate reflects that, with the proposed shutdown of SJGS Units 2 and 3 described above, the mine providing coal to SJGS will continue to operate through 2053, the anticipated life of SJGS.  The 2013 coal mine reclamation study indicates reclamation costs have increased, including significant increases due to the proposed shutdown of SJGS Units 2 and 3, which would reduce the amount of CCBs generated over the remaining life of SJGS and result in a significant increase in the amount of fill dirt required to remediate the underground mine area thereby increasing the overall reclamation costs.  As discussed under Coal Combustion Byproducts Waste Disposal above, SJGS currently disposes of CCBs from the plant in the surface mine pits adjacent to the plant.   
  In 2015, PNM updated its final reclamation costs estimates to reflect the terms of the new reclamation services agreement with Westmoreland, discussed above, and changes resulting from the approval of the 2015 SJCC Mine Permit Plan.  The 2015 reclamation cost estimate reflects that the scope and pricing structure of the reclamation service agreement with Westmoreland

would significantly increase reclamation costs.  In addition, design plan changes, updated regulatory expectation, and common mine reclamation practices incorporated into the 2015 SJCC Mine Permit reflect an increase in the 2015 reclamation cost estimate.  The impacts of these increases, amounting to   $16.5 million  , were recorded at December 31, 2015 and were reflected in regulatory disallowances and restructuring costs.   
  Upon effectiveness of  the CSA and the RA, PNM, on behalf of the SJGS owners, coordinated a more detailed coal mine reclamation cost study, which was completed in the third quarter of 2016.   To complete the study, PNM was provided access to the mine site and obtained supporting data from Westmoreland, allowing for the 2015 study to be refined with a more extensive engineering analysis.  The new reclamation cost estimate reflects the terms of the new reclamation services agreement with Westmoreland and continuation of mining operations through 2053.  The study indicates an increase in the reclamation cost estimate.  PNM s share of the increase is   $4.8 million  , which was recorded at September 30, 2016 and is reflected in regulatory disallowances and restructuring costs in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  The current estimate for decommissioning the Four Corners mine reflects the operation of the mine through 2031, the term of the new agreement for coal supply.  
  Based on the 2016 estimates and PNM s current ownership share of SJGS, PNM s remaining payments as of September 30, 2016 for mine reclamation, in future dollars, are estimated to be   $103.0 million   for the surface mines at both SJGS and Four Corners and   $129.4 million   for the underground mine at SJGS.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, liabilities, in current dollars, of   $41.4 million   and   $38.8 million   for surface mine reclamation and   $13.9 million   and   $11.4 million   for underground mine reclamation were recorded in other deferred credits.  
    
  Under the terms of the CSA, PNM and the other SJGS owners are obligated to compensate SJCC for all reclamation liabilities associated with the supply of coal from the San Juan mine.  On June 1, 2012, the SJGS owners entered into a trust funds agreement to provide funding to compensate SJCC for post-term reclamation obligations under the UG-CSA.  As part of the restructuring of SJGS ownership (see SJGS Ownership Restructuring Matters above), the SJGS owners and PNMR Development negotiated the terms of an amended agreement to fund post-term reclamation obligations under the CSA.  The trust funds agreement requires each owner to enter into an individual trust agreement with a financial institution as trustee, create an irrevocable Reclamation Trust, and periodically deposit funding into the Reclamation Trust for the owner s share of the mine reclamation obligation.  Deposits, which are based on funding curves, must be made on an annual basis.  As part of the restructuring of SJGS ownership discussed above, the SJGS participants agreed to adjusted interim trust funding levels.  Based on the existing trust fund balance at September 30, 2016, PNM s required contributions to its Reclamation Trust fund would be   $3.5 million  ,   $4.7 million  , and   $5.1 million   in 2016, 2017, and 2018. 
  Under the coal supply agreement for Four Corners, which became effective on July 7, 2016, PNM is required to fund its ownership share of estimated final reclamation costs in   thirteen   annual installments, beginning on August 1, 2016, into an irrevocable escrow account solely dedicated to the final reclamation cost of the surface mine at Four Corners.  In July 2016, PNM funded its   $1.9 million   requirement for 2016.  PNM s anticipated funding level is   $2.0 million   and   $2.0 million   in 2017 and 2018.   
  PNM collects a provision for surface and underground mine reclamation costs in its rates.  The NMPRC has capped the amount that can be collected from retail customers for final reclamation of the surface mines at   $100.0 million  .  Previously, PNM recorded a regulatory asset for the   $100.0 million   and recovers the amortization of this regulatory asset in rates.  If future estimates increase the liability for surface mine reclamation, the excess would be expensed at that time.  The reclamation amounts discussed above reflect PNM s estimates of its share of the revised costs.  Regulatory determinations made by the NMPRC may also affect the impact on PNM.  PNM is currently unable to determine the outcome of these matters or the range of possible impacts. 
    
  Continuous Highwall Mining Royalty Rate 
    
  In August 2013, the DOI Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) issued a proposed rulemaking that would retroactively apply the surface mining royalty rate of   12.5%   to continuous highwall mining ( CHM ).  Comments regarding the rulemaking were due on October 11, 2013 and PNM submitted comments in opposition to the proposed rule.  There is no legal deadline for adoption of the final rule. 
    
  SJCC utilized the CHM technique from 2000 to 2003 and, with the approval of the Farmington, New Mexico Field Office of BLM to reclassify the final highwall as underground reserves, applied the   8.0%   underground mining royalty rate to coal mined

using CHM and sold to SJGS.  In March 2001, SJCC learned that the DOI Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) disagreed with the application of the underground royalty rate to CHM.  In August 2006, SJCC and MMS entered into an agreement tolling the statute of limitations on any administrative action to recover unpaid royalties until BLM issued a final, non-appealable determination as to the proper rate for CHM-mined coal.  The proposed BLM rulemaking has the potential to terminate the tolling provision of the settlement agreement, and underpaid royalties of approximately   $5 million   for SJGS would become due if the proposed BLM rule is adopted as proposed.  PNM s share of any amount that is ultimately paid would be approximately   46.3%  , none of which would be passed through PNM s FPPAC.  PNM is unable to predict the outcome of this matter. 
  Four Corners Severance Tax Assessment 
    
  On May 23, 2013, the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department ( NMTRD ) issued a notice of assessment for coal severance surtax, penalty, and interest totaling approximately   $30 million   related to coal supplied under the coal supply agreement for Four Corners.  For procedural reasons, on behalf of the Four Corners co-owners, including PNM, the coal supplier made a partial payment of the assessment and immediately filed a refund claim with respect to that partial payment in August 2013.  NMTRD denied the refund claim.  On December 19, 2013, the coal supplier and APS, on its own behalf and as operating agent for Four Corners, filed a complaint in the New Mexico District Court contesting both the validity of the assessment and the refund claim denial.  On June 30, 2015, the court ruled that the assessment was not valid and further ruled that APS and the other Four Corners co-owners receive a refund of all of the contested amounts previously paid under the applicable tax statute.  NMTRD filed a notice of appeal with the New Mexico Court of Appeals on August 31, 2015.  In March 2016, the parties settled this matter.  PNM has paid its share of the settlement, which was   $0.1 million   in addition to amounts previously paid.  
    
  PVNGS Liability and Insurance Matters  
  Public liability for incidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan.  In accordance with this act, the PVNGS participants have insurance for public liability exposure for a nuclear incident totaling   $13.5 billion   per occurrence.  PVNGS maintains the maximum available nuclear liability insurance in the amount of   $375 million  , which is provided by American Nuclear Insurers.  The remaining balance of   $13.1 billion   is provided through a mandatory industry-wide retrospective assessment program.  If losses at any nuclear power plant covered by the program exceed the accumulated funds, PNM could be assessed retrospective premium adjustments.  Based on PNM s   10.2%   interest in each of the three PVNGS units, PNM s maximum potential retrospective premium assessment per incident for all three units is   $38.9 million  , with a maximum annual payment limitation of   $5.8 million  , to be adjusted periodically for inflation.  
    
  The PVNGS participants maintain  all risk  (including nuclear hazards) insurance for damage to, and decontamination of, property at PVNGS in the aggregate amount of   $2.75 billion  , a substantial portion of which must first be applied to stabilization and decontamination.  These coverages are provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited ( NEIL ).  A sublimit of   $2.25 billion   for non-nuclear property damage losses has been enacted to the primary policy offered by NEIL.  If NEIL s losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds, PNM is subject to retrospective premium assessments of   $5.4 million   for each retrospective premium assessment declared by NEIL s Board of Directors.  The insurance coverages discussed in this and the previous paragraph are subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits, and exclusions.  
  Water Supply  
  Because of New Mexico s arid climate and periodic drought conditions, there is concern in New Mexico about the use of water, including that used for power generation.  Although PNM does not believe that its operations will be materially affected by drought conditions at this time, it cannot forecast long-term weather patterns. Public policy, local, state and federal regulations, and litigation regarding water could also impact PNM operations. To help mitigate these risks, PNM has secured permanent groundwater rights for the existing plants at Reeves Station, Rio Bravo, Afton, Luna, Lordsburg, and La Luz.  Water availability is not an issue for these plants at this time.  However, prolonged drought, ESA activities, and a federal lawsuit by the State of Texas (suing the State of New Mexico over water deliveries) could pose a threat of reduced water availability for these plants.   
  For SJGS, Four Corners, and related mines PNM and APS have secured supplemental water supplies to accommodate the possibility of inadequate precipitation in coming years.  To further mitigate the impacts of severe drought, PNM and APS have entered into agreements with the more senior water rights holders (tribes, municipalities, and agricultural interests) in the San Juan

basin to mutually share the impacts of water shortages with tribes and other water users in the San Juan basin.  The agreements spread the burden of shortages over all water users in the basin instead of just having the more junior water rights holders (like APS and PNM) bear the entire impact of shortages.  The current agreement expires at the end of 2016.  An agreement to share shortages in 2017 through 2020 has been negotiated and awaits endorsement by the parties and the New Mexico State Engineer. 
  In April 2010, APS signed an agreement on behalf of the PVNGS participants with five cities to provide cooling water essential to power production at PVNGS for forty years. 
  PVNGS Water Supply Litigation  
  In 1986, an action commenced regarding the rights of APS and the other PVNGS participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at PVNGS.  APS filed claims that dispute the court s jurisdiction over PVNGS  groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to PVNGS and, alternatively, seek confirmation of those rights.  In 1999, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision finding that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and Indian tribes.  In addition, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision in 2000 affirming the lower court s criteria for resolving groundwater claims.  Litigation on these issues has continued in the trial court.  No trial dates have been set in these matters.  PNM does not expect that this litigation will have a material impact on its results of operation, financial position, or cash flows.  
  San Juan River Adjudication   
  In 1975, the State of New Mexico filed an action in New Mexico District Court to adjudicate all water rights in the San Juan River Stream System, including water used at Four Corners and SJGS.  PNM was made a defendant in the litigation in 1976.  In March 2009, President Obama signed legislation confirming a 2005 settlement with the Navajo Nation.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Navajo Nation s water rights would be settled and finally determined by entry by the court of two proposed adjudication decrees.  The court issued an order in August 2013 finding that no evidentiary hearing was warranted in the Navajo Nation proceeding and, on November 1, 2013, issued a Partial Final Judgment and Decree of the Water Rights of the Navajo Nation approving the proposed settlement with the Navajo Nation.  Several parties filed a joint motion for a new trial, which was denied by the court.  A number of parties subsequently appealed to the New Mexico Court of Appeals.  PNM has entered its appearance in the appellate case.  No hearing dates have been set at this time.  
  PNM is participating in this proceeding since PNM s water rights in the San Juan Basin may be affected by the rights recognized in the settlement agreement as being owned by the Navajo Nation, which comprise a significant portion of water available from sources on the San Juan River and in the San Juan Basin.  PNM is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate the amount or range of potential loss and cannot determine the effect, if any, of any water rights adjudication on the present arrangements for water at SJGS and Four Corners.  Final resolution of the case cannot be expected for several years.  An agreement reached with the Navajo Nation in 1985, however, provides that if Four Corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication, the Navajo Nation will provide, for an agreed upon cost, sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss.   
  Rights-of-Way Matter 
    
  On January 28, 2014, the County Commission of Bernalillo County, New Mexico passed an ordinance requiring utilities to enter into a use agreement and pay a yet-to-be-determined fee as a condition to installing, maintaining, and operating facilities on county rights-of-way.  The fee is purported to compensate the county for costs of administering, maintaining, and capital improvements to the rights-of-way.  On February 27, 2014, PNM and other utilities filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico challenging the validity of the ordinance.  The court denied the utilities  motion for judgment.  The court further granted the County s motion to dismiss the state law claims.  The utilities filed an amended complaint reflecting the two federal claims remaining before the federal court.  The utilities also filed a complaint in Bernalillo County, New Mexico District Court reflecting the state law counts dismissed by the federal court.  In subsequent briefing in federal court, the County filed a motion for judgment on one of the utilities  claims, which was granted by the court, leaving a claim regarding telecommunications service as the remaining federal claim.  This matter is ongoing in state court.  The utilities and Bernalillo County reached a standstill agreement whereby the County would not take any enforcement action against the utilities pursuant to the ordinance during the pendency of the litigation, but not including any period for appeal of a judgment, or upon 30 days written notice by either the County or the utilities of their intention to terminate the agreement.  If the challenges to the ordinance are unsuccessful, PNM believes any fees paid pursuant to the ordinance would be considered

franchise fees and would be recoverable from customers.  PNM is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or its impact on PNM s operations.  
  Navajo Nation Allottee Matters  
  A putative class action was filed against PNM and other utilities in February 2009 in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico.  Plaintiffs claim to be allottees, members of the Navajo Nation, who pursuant to the Dawes Act of 1887, were allotted ownership in land carved out of the Navajo Nation and allege that defendants, including PNM, are rights-of-way grantees with rights-of-way across the allotted lands and are either in trespass or have paid insufficient fees for the grant of rights-of-way or both.  In March 2010, the court ordered that the entirety of the plaintiffs  case be dismissed.  The court did not grant plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, finding that they instead must pursue and exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking redress in federal court.  In May 2010, plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ), which was denied by the BIA Regional Director.  In May 2011, plaintiffs appealed the Regional Director s decision to the DOI, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Interior Board of Indian Appeals.  Following briefing on the merits, on August 20, 2013, that board issued a decision upholding the Regional Director s decision that the allottees had failed to perfect their appeals, and dismissed the allottees  appeals, without prejudice.  The allottees have not refiled their appeals.  Although this matter was dismissed without prejudice, PNM considers the matter concluded.  However, PNM continues to monitor this matter in order to preserve its interests regarding any PNM-acquired rights-of-way.   
  In a separate matter, in September 2012,   43   landowners claiming to be Navajo allottees filed a notice of appeal with the BIA appealing a March 2011 decision of the BIA Regional Director regarding renewal of a right-of-way for a PNM transmission line.  The allottees, many of whom are also allottees in the above matter, generally allege that they were not paid fair market value for the right-of-way, that they were denied the opportunity to make a showing as to their view of fair market value, and thus denied due process.  On January 6, 2014, PNM received notice that the BIA, Navajo Region, requested a review of an appraisal report on   58   allotment parcels.  After review, the BIA concluded it would continue to rely on the values of the original appraisal.  On March 27, 2014, while this matter was stayed, the allottees filed a motion to dismiss their appeal with prejudice.  On April 2, 2014, the allottees  appeal was dismissed with prejudice.  Subsequent to the dismissal, PNM received a letter from counsel on behalf of what appears to be a subset of the   43   landowner allottees involved in the appeal, notifying PNM that the specified allottees were revoking their consents for renewal of right of way on   six   specific allotments.  On January 22, 2015, PNM received a letter from the BIA Regional Director identifying   ten   allotments with rights-of-way renewals that were previously contested.  The letter indicated that the renewals were not approved by the BIA because the previous consent obtained by PNM was later revoked, prior to BIA approval, by the majority owners of the allotments.  It is the BIA Regional Director s position that PNM must re-obtain consent from these landowners.  On July 13, 2015, PNM filed a condemnation action in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico regarding the approximately   15.49   acres of land at issue.  On December 1, 2015, the court ruled that PNM could not condemn   2   of the   5   allotments at issue based on the Navajo Nation s fractional interest in the land.  PNM s motion for reconsideration of this ruling was denied.  On March 31, 2016, the Tenth Circuit granted PNM s petition to appeal the December 1, 2015 ruling.  On September 18, 2015, the allottees filed a separate complaint against PNM for federal trespass.  Both matters have been consolidated and are stayed while PNM pursues its appeal before the Tenth Circuit.  On June 27, 2016, PNM filed its opening brief in the Tenth Circuit.  Amicus briefs were filed in support of PNM s position.  On October 5, 2016, the United States, the Navajo Nation, and individual allottees filed their response briefs.  After the response briefs were filed, other entities requested leave to file amicus briefs addressing arguments raised in the United States  response brief.  PNM cannot predict the outcome of these matters.

PNM 
    
  New Mexico General Rate Case   ( NM 2015 Rate Case ) 
    
  On August 27, 2015, PNM filed an application with the NMPRC for a general increase in retail electric rates.  The application proposed a revenue increase of   $123.5 million  , including base non-fuel revenues of   $121.7 million  .  The application was based on a future test year ( FTY ) period beginning October 1, 2015 and proposed a ROE of   10.5%  .  The primary drivers of PNM s identified revenue deficiency were the cost of infrastructure investments, including depreciation expense based on an updated depreciation study, and a decline in energy sales as a result of PNM s successful energy efficiency programs and economic factors.  The application included several proposed changes in rate design to establish fair and equitable pricing across rate classes and to better align cost recovery with cost causation.  Specific rate design proposals included higher customer and demand charges, a revenue decoupling pilot program applicable to residential and small commercial customers, a re-allocation of revenue among PNM s customer classes, a new economic development rate, and continuation of PNM s renewable energy rider.  PNM requested that the proposed new rates become effective beginning in July 2016.  On March 2, 2016, the NMPRC required PNM to file supplemental testimony regarding the treatment of renewable energy in PNM s FPPAC due to issues identified in PNM s 2016 renewable energy procurement plan and extended the rate suspension period to July 31, 2016.  As ordered by the NMPRC, PNM filed supplemental testimony in the NM 2015 Rate Case demonstrating that PNM s FPPAC is designed to properly recover its fuel and purchased power expenses.  See Renewable Portfolio Standard below.  A public hearing on the proposed new rates was held in April 2016.  Subsequent to this hearing, the NMPRC ordered PNM to file additional testimony regarding PNM s interests in PVNGS, including the   64.1   MW of PVNGS Unit 2 that PNM repurchased in January 2016, pursuant to the terms of the initial sales-leaseback transactions (Note 6).  A subsequent public hearing was held in June 2016.  After the close of the April hearing, the NMPRC further extended the rate suspension period through August 31, 2016.  After the June hearing, PNM and other parties were ordered to file supplemental briefs and to provide final recommended revenue requirements that incorporated fuel savings that PNM implemented effective January 1, 2016 from PNM s SJGS coal supply agreement.  PNM s filing indicated that recovery for fuel related costs would be reduced by approximately   $42.9 million   reflecting the current CSA (Note 11), which also reduced the request for base non-fuel related revenues by   $0.2 million   to   $121.5 million  .  
    
  On August 4, 2016, the hearing examiner in the case issued a recommended decision ( RD ).  The RD proposed an increase in non-fuel revenues of   $41.3 million   compared to the   $121.5 million   increase requested by PNM.  Major components of the difference in the increase in non-fuel revenues, include: 

The RD proposed disallowing recovery of the entire   $163.3 million   purchase price for the January 15, 2016 purchases of the assets underlying   three   leases of portions of PVNGS Unit 2 (Note 6); the RD proposed that power from the previously leased assets, aggregating   64.1   MW of capacity, be dedicated to serving New Mexico retail customers with those customers being charged for the costs of fuel and operating and maintenance expenses (other than property taxes, which are currently   $0.8 million   per year), but the customers would not bear any capital or depreciation costs other than those related to improvements made after the date of the original leases 
                
    The RD proposed that PNM   not   recover from retail customers any of the rent expense, which aggregate   $18.1 million   per year, under the   four   leases of capacity in PVNGS Unit 1 that were extended for   eight   years beginning January 15, 2015 and the   one   lease of capacity in PVNGS Unit 2 that was extended for   eight   years beginning January 15, 2016 (Note 6) and   not   recover related property taxes, which are currently   $1.5 million   per year; the RD proposed that power from the leased assets, aggregating   114.6   MW of capacity, be dedicated to serving New Mexico retail customers with those customers being charged for the costs of fuel and operating and maintenance expense, except that customers would not bear rental costs or property taxes 
                
    The RD proposed that PNM   not   recover the costs of converting SJGS Units 1 and 4 to BDT, which is required by the NSR permit for SJGS, (Note 11);  PNM s share of the costs of installing the BDT equipment was   $52.3 million   of which   $40.0 million   was included in rate base in PNM s current rate request 
                
    The RD proposed that   $4.5 million   of amounts recorded as regulatory assets and deferred charges not be recovered from retail customers 
       
  The RD recommended that the NMPRC find PNM was imprudent in the actions taken to purchase the previously leased   64.1   MW of capacity in PVNGS Unit 2, extending the leases for   114.6   MW of capacity of PVNGS Units 1 and 2, and installing

the BDT equipment on SJGS Units 1 and 4.  The RD also proposed that all fuel costs be removed from base rates and be recovered through the FPPAC.  The RD would credit retail customers with   100%   of the New Mexico jurisdictional portion of revenues from refined coal (a third-party pre-treatment process) at SJGS.  In addition, the RD would remove recovery of the costs of power obtained from New Mexico Wind from the FPPAC and include recovery of those costs through PNM s renewable energy rider discussed below.  The RD recommended continuation of the renewable energy rider and certain aspects of PNM s proposals regarding rate design, but would not approve certain other rate design proposals or PNM s request for a revenue decoupling pilot program.  The RD proposed approving PNM s proposals for revised depreciation rates (with one exception), the inclusion of CWIP in rate base, and ratemaking treatment of the prepaid pension asset.  The RD did not preclude PNM from supporting the prudence of the PVNGS purchases and lease renewals in its next general rate case and seeking recovery of those costs.  PNM disagreed with many of the key conclusions reached by the hearing examiner in the RD and filed exceptions to defend its prudent utility investments.  Other parties also filed exceptions to the RD.  The NMPRC extended the rate suspension period to end on September 30, 2016.    
    
  The NMPRC issued a final order on September 28, 2016 that authorizes PNM to implement an increase in non-fuel rates of   $61.2 million  , effective for bills sent to customers after September 30, 2016.  The final order generally approved the RD, but with certain significant modifications.  The modifications to the RD include: 

Inclusion of the January 2016 purchase of the assets underlying   three   leases of capacity, aggregating   64.1   MW, of PVNGS Unit 2 at an initial rate base value of   $83.7 million  ; and disallowance of the recovery of the undepreciated costs of capitalized improvements made during the period the   64.1   MW was being leased by PNM, which aggregated   $43.8 million   when the final order was issued  
                
    Full recovery of the rent expense and property taxes associated with the extended leases for capacity, aggregating   114.6   MW, in Palo Verde Units 1 and 2 
                
    Disallowance of the recovery of any future contribution for PVNGS decommissioning costs related to the   64.1   MW of capacity purchased in January 2016 and the   114.6   MW of capacity under the extended leases 
                
    Recovery of assumed operating and maintenance expense savings of   $0.3 million   annually related to BDT  
       
  On September 30, 2016, PNM filed a Notice of Appeal with the NM Supreme Court regarding the final order in the NM 2015 Rate Case.  Subsequently, NEE, NMIEC, and ABCWUA filed notices of cross-appeal.  On October 26, 2016, PNM filed, with the NM Supreme Court, a statement of issues related to its appeal, which states PNM is appealing the NMPRC s determination that PNM was  imprudent in the actions taken to purchase the previously leased   64.1   MW of capacity in PVNGS Unit 2, extending the leases for   114.6   MW of capacity of PVNGS Units 1 and 2, and installing the BDT equipment on SJGS Units 1 and 4.  Specifically, PNM s statement indicated it is appealing the following elements of the NMPRC s final order: 

Disallowance of recovery of the full purchase price, representing fair market value, of the   64.1   MW of capacity in PVNGS Unit 2 purchased in January 2016 
                
    Disallowance of the recovery of the undepreciated costs of capitalized improvements made during the period the   64.1   MW of capacity was leased by PNM 
                
    Disallowance of recovery of future contributions for PVNGS decommissioning attributable to previously leased capacity 
                
    Disallowance of recovery of the costs of converting SJGS Units 1 and 4 to BDT 
       
  The court has taken no action with respect to the appeals.  Although appeals of regulatory actions of the NMPRC have a priority at the NM Supreme Court under New Mexico law, there is no required time frame for the court to act on the appeals.   
    
  As of September 30, 2016, PNM evaluated the accounting consequences of the final order in the NM 2015 Rate Case and the likelihood of being successful on the issues it is appealing in the NM Supreme Court as required under GAAP.  The evaluation indicates it is reasonably possible that PNM will be successful on the issues it is appealing.  If the NM Supreme Court rules in PNM s favor on some or all of the issues, those issues would be remanded back to the NMPRC for further action.  PNM estimates that it will take a minimum of   15   months, from the date PNM filed its appeal, for the NM Supreme Court to render a decision and for the NMPRC to take action on any remanded issues.  During such time, the rates specified in the final order will remain in effect.  Accordingly, at September 30, 2016, PNM recorded a pre-tax regulatory disallowance of   $6.8 million   representing   15   months of capital cost recovery of its investments in the PVNGS Unit 2 purchases, PVNGS Unit 2 capitalized improvements, and BDT that the final order disallowed.  In addition, PNM recorded a pre-tax regulatory disallowance for   $4.5 million   of costs reco

rded as regulatory assets and deferred charges, which the final order disallowed and which PNM did not propose to challenge in its appeal, since PNM can no longer assert that those assets are probable of being recovered through the ratemaking process.  The NMPRC s final order approved PNM s request to record a regulatory asset to recover a 2014 impairment of PNM s New Mexico net operating loss carryforward resulting from an extension of the income tax provision for fifty percent bonus depreciation.  The impact, net of federal income taxes, amounts to   $2.1 million  , which is reflected as a reduction of income tax expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 
    
  PNM continues to believe that the disallowed investments, which are the subject of PNM s appeal, were prudently incurred and that PNM is entitled to full recovery of those investments through the ratemaking process.  Although PNM believes it is reasonably possible that its appeals will be successful, it cannot predict what decision the NM Supreme Court will reach or what further actions the NMPRC will take on any issues remanded to it by the court.  If PNM s appeal is unsuccessful, PNM would record further pre-tax losses related to any unsuccessful issues.  The amounts of any such losses would depend on the ultimate outcome of the appeal and NMPRC process, as well as the actual amounts reflected on PNM books at the time of the resolution.  However, based on the book values recorded by PNM as of September 30, 2016, the losses could include: 

The remaining costs to acquire the assets previously leased under   three   leases aggregating   64.1   MW of PVNGS Unit 2 capacity in excess of the recovery permitted under the NMPRC s final order; the net book value of such excess amount was   $76.9 million  , after considering the loss recorded at September 30, 2016 
                
    The undepreciated costs of capitalized improvements made during the period the   64.1   MW of capacity in PVNGS Unit 2 purchased by PNM in January 2016 was being leased by PNM; the net book value of these improvements was $  41.7 million  , after considering the loss recorded at September 30, 2016 
                
    The remaining costs to convert SJGS Units 1 and 4 to BDT; the net book value of these assets was   $49.9 million  , after considering the loss recorded at September 30, 2016 
       
  PNM is unable to predict the outcome of this matter. 
    
  Renewable Portfolio Standard  
  The REA establishes a mandatory RPS requiring a utility to acquire a renewable energy portfolio equal to   10%   of retail electric sales by 2011,   15%   by 2015, and   20%   by 2020.  PNM files annual renewable energy procurement plans for approval by the NMPRC.  The NMPRC requires renewable energy portfolios to be  fully diversified.  The current diversity requirements, which are subject to the limitation of the RCT, are minimums of   30%   wind,   20%   solar,   3%   distributed generation, and   5%   other. 
  The REA provides for streamlined proceedings for approval of utilities  renewable energy procurement plans, assures that utilities recover costs incurred consistent with approved procurement plans, and requires the NMPRC to establish a RCT for the procurement of renewable resources to prevent excessive costs being added to rates.  Currently, the RCT is set at   3%   of customers  annual electric charges.  PNM makes renewable procurements consistent with the NMPRC approved plans.  PNM recovers certain renewable procurement costs from customers through a rate rider.  See Renewable Energy Rider     below.  
    
  PNM filed its 2016 renewable energy procurement plan on June 1, 2015.  The plan met RPS and diversity requirements within the RCT in 2016 and 2017 using existing resources and does not propose any significant new procurements.  The NMPRC approved the plan in November 2015, and, after granting a rehearing motion to consider issues regarding the rate treatment of certain customers eligible for a cap on RPS procurement costs and customers exempt from RPS procurement costs, the NMPRC again approved the plan in an order issued on February 3, 2016.  The NMPRC deferred issues related to capped and exempt customers to PNM s NM 2015 Rate Case and to a new case, which the NMPRC subsequently initiated through issuance of an order to show cause.  The NM 2015 Rate Case and show cause proceedings were to examine whether PNM miscalculated the FPPAC factor and base fuel costs in its treatment of renewable energy costs and application of the renewable procurement cost caps and exemptions.  On April 28, 2016, PNM filed a motion to stay this proceeding until the issuance of a final order in the NM 2015 Rate Case, based on the fact that the issues addressed in the show cause proceeding were being addressed in the NM 2015 Rate Case.  On May 4, 2016, the NMPRC granted PNM s motion.  In the September 28, 2016 final order in the NM 2015 Rate Case, the NMPRC ordered the cost of New Mexico Wind to be recovered through PNM s renewable rider, rather than the FPPAC, and certain other modifications regarding the accounting for renewable energy in PNM s FPPAC.  These modifications do not

affect the amount of fuel and purchased power or renewable costs that PNM will collect.  PNM cannot predict the outcome of the show cause proceeding. 
    
  PNM filed its 2017 renewable energy procurement plan on June 1, 2016.  The plan meets RPS and diversity requirements for 2017 and 2018 using existing resources and does not propose any significant new procurements.  PNM projects that its plan will slightly exceed the RCT in 2017 and will be within the RCT in 2018.  PNM has requested a variance from the RCT in 2017 to the extent the NMPRC determines a variance is necessary.  A public hearing was held on September 26, 2016.  On October 21, 2016, the Hearing Examiner issued a Recommended Decision recommending that the plan be approved as filed and also found that a variance from the RCT is not required.  Pursuant to the REA, the NMPRC must enter an order approving or modifying the plan by November 28, 2016.  PNM cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

  The NMPRC has authorized PNM to recover certain renewable procurement costs through a rate rider billed on a per KWh basis.  In PNM s NM 2015 Rate Case, the NMPRC authorized continuation of the renewable rider.   
    
  In its 2016 renewable energy procurement plan case, PNM proposed to collect   $42.4 million   in 2016.  The 2016 rider adjustment was approved as part of the final order issued February 3, 2016 approving the 2016 renewable energy plan.  In its 2017 renewable energy procurement plan discussed above, PNM proposes to collect   $50.0 million   through the rider in 2017.  The increase, as compared with the amount the NMPRC approved for recovery through the rider in 2016, is due to including recovery of the costs of procuring energy from New Mexico Wind through the rider, rather than through its FPPAC, which complies with the NMPRC s final order in PNM s NM 2015 Rate Case. 
  As a separate component of the rider, if PNM s earned return on jurisdictional equity in a calendar year, adjusted for weather and other items not representative of normal operations, exceeds the NMPRC-approved rate by   0.5%  , PNM would be required to refund the excess to customers during May through December of the following year.  The NMPRC-approved rate was   10.0%   when the renewable rider was initially approved.  On April 1, 2016, PNM made a compliance filing at the NMPRC showing that its jurisdictional equity return did not exceed   10.5%   in 2015. 
    
  Energy Efficiency and Load Management 
    
  Public utilities are required by the Efficient Use of Energy Act to achieve specified levels of energy savings and to obtain NMPRC approval to implement energy efficiency and load management programs.  In 2013, this act was amended to set an annual program budget equal to   3%   of an electric utility s annual revenue.  PNM s costs to implement approved programs are recovered through a rate rider.  
    
  2016 Energy Efficiency Program Application 
    
  On April 15, 2016, PNM filed an application for energy efficiency and load management programs to be offered in 2017.  The proposed program portfolio consists of ten programs with a total budget of   $28.0 million  .  The application also seeks approval of an incentive of   $2.4 million   based on target savings of   75   GWh.  The actual incentive will be based upon actual savings achieved.  An unopposed stipulation settling all issues was filed on September 29, 2016.  The stipulation establishes a method to ensure that funding of PNM s energy efficiency program is equal to   3%   of its retail revenues, with an estimated 2017 energy efficiency funding level of   $26.0 million  , and a sliding scale profit incentive with a base level of   7.1%   of program costs if PNM achieves a minimum proscribed level of energy savings and increasing to a maximum of   9.0%   depending on actual energy savings achieved above the minimum.  A public hearing was held on October 26 and 27, 2016.  PNM cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  
  Energy Efficiency Rulemaking 
  On May 17, 2012, the NMPRC issued a NOPR that would have amended the NMPRC s energy efficiency rule to authorize use of a decoupling mechanism to recover certain fixed costs of providing retail electric service as the mechanism for removal of disincentives associated with the implementation of energy efficiency programs.  The proposed rule also addressed incentives associated with energy efficiency.  On July 26, 2012, the NMPRC closed the proposed rulemaking and opened a new energy efficiency rulemaking docket that may address decoupling and incentives.  Workshops to develop a proposed rule have been held,

but no order proposing a rule has been issued.  PNM is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.  
    
  Integrated Resource Plan  
  NMPRC rules require that investor owned utilities file an IRP every   three   years.  The IRP is required to cover a   20  -year planning period and contain an action plan covering the first four years of that period.  PNM filed its 2014 IRP on July 1, 2014.  The four-year action plan was consistent with the replacement resources identified in PNM s application to retire SJGS Units 2 and 3.  PNM indicated that it planned to meet its anticipated long-term load growth with a combination of additional renewable energy resources, energy efficiency, and natural gas-fired facilities.  Consistent with statute and NMPRC rule, PNM incorporated a public advisory process into the development of its 2014 IRP.  On July 31, 2014, several parties requested the NMPRC not to accept the 2014 IRP as compliant with NMPRC rule because to do so could affect the pending proceeding on PNM s application to abandon SJGS Units 2 and 3 and for CCNs for certain replacement resources (Note 11) and because they asserted that the IRP does not conform to the NMPRC s IRP rule.  Certain parties also asked that further proceedings on the IRP be held in abeyance until the conclusion of the then pending SJGS abandonment/CCN proceeding.  The NMPRC issued an order in August 2014 that docketed a case to determine whether the IRP complies with applicable NMPRC rules. The order also held the case in abeyance pending the issuance of final, non-appealable orders in PNM s 2015 renewable energy procurement plan case and its application to retire SJGS Units 2 and 3.  The final order regarding PNM s application to abandon SJGS Units 2 and 3 described in Note 11 states that the NMPRC will issue a Notice of Proposed Dismissal in the 2014 IRP docket.  On May 4, 2016, the NMPRC issued the Notice of Proposed Dismissal, stating that the docket will be closed with prejudice within thirty days unless good cause is shown why the docket should remain open.  On May 31, 2016, NEE filed a request to hold the protests filed against PNM s IRP in abeyance or to dismiss those protests without prejudice.  PNM responded on June 13, 2016 and requested that the NMPRC dismiss the case with prejudice.  The NMPRC has not yet acted on its Notice of Proposed Dismissal or the request filed on May 31, 2016. 
  San Juan Generating Station Units 2 and 3 Retirement  
  On December 16, 2015, the NMPRC issued an order approving PNM s retirement of SJGS Units 2 and 3 on December 31, 2017.  On January 14, 2016, NEE filed an appeal of the final order with the NM Supreme Court.  Additional information concerning the NMPRC filing and related proceedings is set forth in Note 11.  
  Application for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity 
    
  On June 30, 2015, PNM filed an application for a CCN for a   187   MW gas plant to be located at SJGS.  This resource was identified as a replacement resource in PNM s application to retire SJGS Units 2 and 3.  On February 12, 2016, PNM filed a motion to withdraw its application and stated that it would file either a new CCN application for a gas-fueled resource or a report on the status of that application.  On May 18, 2016, the NMPRC issued an order granting PNM s request to withdraw the application and closing the case. 
    
  On April 26, 2016, PNM filed an application for an   80   MW gas plant to be located at SJGS.  The plant would consist of   two     40   MW aeroderivative units.  PNM had requested a final order from the NMPRC by December 1, 2016 to facilitate a June 2018 in-service date.  On October 13, 2016, PNM filed a motion to vacate the procedural schedule to allow PNM to assess the continued need for the plant in light of possible changed circumstances affecting loads and resources.  The motion was granted on October 20, 2016.  On October 28, 2016, PNM filed a motion to withdraw its application and close the docket.  As grounds for the motion, PNM stated that, based on its updated peak demand forecast, the   80   MW plant would not be needed in 2018.  PNM will continue to evaluate its resource needs as part of its ongoing resource planning activities and during the 2017 IRP process in which PNM s entire   20  -year portfolio of supply and demand-side resources will be evaluated in terms of cost and reliability requirements.  PNM s current capital forecast includes an additional   40   MW of peaking capacity that would be operational in 2020 to meet requirements for operating reserves.  PNM cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. 
    
  Advanced Metering Infrastructure Application 
    
  On February 26, 2016, PNM filed an application with the NMPRC requesting approval of a project to replace its existing customer metering equipment with Advanced Metering Infrastructure ( AMI ).  The application also asks the NMPRC to authorize the recovery of the cost of the project, up to   $87.2 million  , in future ratemaking proceedings, as well as to approve the recovery

of the remaining undepreciated investment in existing metering equipment estimated to be approximately   $33 million   at the date of implementation and the costs of customer education and severance for any affected employees.  PNM does not intend to proceed with the AMI project unless the NMPRC approves the entire application.  On August 5, 2016, PNM filed a motion to suspend its AMI application so that it could evaluate the effect of the final order in the NM 2015 Rate Case.  This motion was approved and PNM must either propose a new procedural schedule or file a motion to withdraw the AMI application by November 28, 2016.  PNM cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  
    
  Facebook Data Center Project 
    
  On July 8, 2016, PNM filed an application with the NMPRC for approval of: 

Two new electric service rates  
                
    A PPA under which PNM would purchase renewable energy from PNMR Development  
                
    A special service contract to provide electric service to a prospective new customer, a large Internet company, that was considering locating a data center in PNM s service area  
     The NMPRC approved PNM s application on August 17, 2016.   At that time, the new customer was also considering the state of Utah for the location of the data center.  On September 15, 2016, PNM filed a notice informing the NMPRC that the customer, Facebook Inc., had announced that it was selecting a site in New Mexico for its new data center. 
  The customer s service requirements include the acquisition by PNM of a sufficient amount of new renewable energy resources and RECs to match the energy and capacity requirements of the data center.  PNM s initial procurement will be through a PPA with PNMR Development for the energy production from   30   MW of new solar capacity that PNMR Development will construct and own.  The cost of the PPA will be passed through to the customer under a new rate rider.  A new special service rate will be applied to the customer s energy consumption in those hours of the month when the customer s consumption exceeds the energy production from the new renewable resources.  Construction of the first   10   MW of solar capacity is expected to be completed in early 2018, which will coincide with initial operations of the data center, with the remainder of the capacity completed by mid-2018.  
  The approval order included a provision requiring that in any future rate case filed by PNM requesting an increase in rates of any other customer class, the NMPRC shall determine whether or not any customer class will be subject to increased rates due to the new customer s fixed  Contribution to Production Charge for System Supplied Energy  and, if so, the NMPRC shall determine whether or not PNM will be allowed to recover such increased costs in the form of increased rates to other customers.  
  Formula Transmission Rate Case  
  On December 31, 2012, PNM filed an application with FERC for authorization to move from charging stated rates for wholesale electric transmission service to a formula rate mechanism pursuant to which rates for wholesale transmission service are calculated annually in accordance with an approved formula.  The proposed formula includes updating cost of service components, including investment in plant and operating expenses, based on information contained in PNM s annual financial report filed with FERC, as well as including projected large transmission capital projects to be placed into service in the following year.  The projections included are subject to true-up in the following year formula rate.  Certain items, including changes to return on equity and depreciation rates, require a separate filing to be made with FERC before being included in the formula rate.  As filed, PNM s request would have resulted in a   $3.2 million   wholesale electric transmission rate increase, based on PNM s 2011 data and a   10.81%   return on equity ( ROE ), and authority to adjust transmission rates annually based on an approved formula.  
  On March 1, 2013, FERC issued an order (1) accepting PNM s revisions to its rates for filing and suspending the proposed revisions to become effective August 2, 2013, subject to refund; (2) directing PNM to submit a compliance filing to establish its ROE using the median, rather than the mid-point, of the ROEs from a proxy group of companies; (3) directing PNM to submit a compliance filing to remove from its rate proposal the acquisition adjustment related to PNM s   60%   ownership of the EIP transmission line, which was acquired in 2003; and (4) setting the proceeding for hearing and settlement judge procedures.  On April 1, 2013, PNM made the required compliance filing.  PNM would be allowed to make a separate filing related to recovery of the EIP acquisition adjustment.  On August 2, 2013, new rates went into effect, subject to refund.  In June 2013, May 2014, and March 2015, PNM made additional filings incorporating final 2012, 2013, and 2014 data into the formula rate request.  On March

20, 2015, PNM along with   five   other parties entered into a settlement agreement, which was filed at FERC.  The settlement reflects a ROE of   10%   and results in an annualized increase of   $1.3 million   above the rates approved in the previous rate case.  Additionally, the parties filed a motion to implement the settled rates effective April 1, 2015.  On March 25, 2015, the ALJ issued an order authorizing the interim implementation of settled rates beginning on April 1, 2015, subject to refund.  In May 2015, the settlement judge recommended that FERC approve the settlement.  On March 17, 2016, FERC approved the settlement.  PNM made the refunds required under the settlement in May 2016. 
  Firm-Requirements Wholesale Customers       Navopache Electric Cooperative, Inc.    
    
  As discussed in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K, NEC filed a petition on April 8, 2015 for a declaratory order requesting that FERC find that NEC can purchase an unlimited amount of power and energy from third party supplier(s) under its PSA with PNM.  Following proceedings before a settlement judge, PNM and NEC entered into, and filed with FERC, a settlement agreement on October 29, 2015 that includes certain amendments to the PSA and related contracts on file with FERC.  FERC approved the settlement on January 21, 2016.  Under the settlement agreement, PNM will serve all of NEC s load in 2016 at reduced demand and energy rates from those under the PSA.  Beginning January 1, 2016, NEC is also paying certain third-party transmission costs that it did not pay in 2014 and partially paid in 2015.  The PSA and related transmission agreements will terminate on December 31, 2016.  In 2017, PNM will serve   10   MW of NEC s load under a short term coordination tariff at a rate lower than provided under the PSA.  Revenues from NEC under the PSA were   $4.8 million   and   $6.3 million   in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and   $14.8 million   and   $19.7 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   
  TNMP    
  Advanced Meter System Deployment  
  In July 2011, the PUCT approved a settlement and authorized an AMS deployment plan that permits TNMP to collect   $113.4 million   in deployment costs through a surcharge over a   12  -year period.  TNMP began collecting the surcharge on August 11, 2011.  Deployment of advanced meters began in September 2011.  TNMP has completed its mass deployment by installing   242,246   advanced meters over a   5  -year period.   
  The PUCT adopted a rule on August 15, 2013 creating a non-standard metering service for retail customers choosing to decline standard metering service via an advanced meter.  The cost of providing non-standard metering service is to be borne by opt-out customers through an initial fee and ongoing monthly charge.  As approved by the PUCT, TNMP is recovering   $0.2 million   in costs through initial fees ranging from   $63.97   to   $168.61   and ongoing annual expenses of   $0.5 million   through a   $36.78   monthly fee.  These amounts presume up to   1,081   consumers will elect the non-standard meter service, but TNMP has the right to adjust the fees if the number of anticipated consumers differs from that estimate.  As of October 21, 2016,   100   customers have made the election.  TNMP does not expect the implementation of non-standard metering service to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  On October 2, 2015, TNMP filed a reconciliation of the costs and savings of its AMS deployment program with the PUCT.  Those costs include   $71.0 million   in capital costs and   $18.0 million   in operation and maintenance expenses.  However, since the deployment was not complete and the total program costs to date were   $1.5 million   below the original approved forecasts, TNMP did not request a change to its monthly surcharge amount.  On January 8, 2016, the PUCT staff recommended that the PUCT approve TNMP s reconciliation without adjustment and the PUCT accepted that recommendation on March 25, 2016.  
    
  Transmission Cost of Service Rates  
  TNMP can update its transmission rates twice per year to reflect changes in its invested capital.  Updated rates reflect the addition and retirement of transmission facilities, including appropriate depreciation, federal income tax and other associated taxes, and the approved rate of return on such facilities.  The following sets forth TNMP s recent interim transmission cost rate increases:

Energy Efficiency 
    
  TNMP recovers the costs of its energy efficiency programs through an energy efficiency cost recovery factor ( EECRF ), which includes projected program costs, under or over collected costs from prior years, rate case expenses, and performance bonuses (if the programs exceed mandated savings goals).  On May 27, 2016, TNMP filed its request to adjust the EECRF to reflect changes in costs for 2017.  The total amount requested is   $6.1 million  , which includes a performance bonus of   $0.8 million   based on TNMP s energy efficiency achievements in the 2015 plan year.  On July 27, 2016, TNMP reached a settlement with the PUCT staff and intervenors approving a total request of   $6.0 million  , which includes a performance bonus of   $0.8 million  .  The settlement was approved by the PUCT on September 8, 2016 and updated rates will become effective on March 1, 2017. 

In 2013, New Mexico House Bill 641 reduced the New Mexico corporate income tax rate from   7.6%   to   5.9%  .  The rate reduction is being phased-in from 2014 to 2018.  In accordance with GAAP, PNMR and PNM adjusted accumulated deferred income taxes to reflect the tax rate at which the balances are expected to reverse during the period that includes the date of enactment, which was in the year ended December 31, 2013.  At that time, the portion of the adjustment related to PNM s regulated activities was recorded as a reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which was offset by an increase in a regulatory liability, on the assumption that PNM will be required to return the benefit to customers over time.  In addition, the portion of the adjustment that is not related to PNM s regulated activities was recorded in PNMR s Corporate and Other segment as a reduction in deferred tax assets and an increase in income tax expense.  Changes in the estimated timing of reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities will result in refinements of the impacts of this change in tax rates being recorded periodically until 2018, when the rate reduction is fully phased in.  In the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, PNM s regulatory liability was reduced by   $7.1 million   and   $2.0 million  , which increased deferred tax liabilities.  Deferred tax assets not related to PNM s regulatory activities were: reduced by   $0.7 million   in the three months ended March 31, 2016, increasing income tax expense by   $0.8 million   for PNM and reducing income tax expense by   $0.1 million   for the Corporate and Other segment; and increased by   $0.7 million   in the three months ended March 31, 2015, reducing income tax expense by   $0.5 million   for PNM and   $0.2 million   for the Corporate and Other segment.  
    
  In 2008, fifty percent bonus tax depreciation was enacted as a temporary two-year stimulus measure as part of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008.  Bonus tax depreciation in various forms has been continuously extended since that time, most recently by the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015.  The 2015 act extends and phases-out bonus tax depreciation through 2019.  As a result of the net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes created by bonus depreciation, and reduced future income taxes payable resulting from New Mexico House Bill 641, certain tax carryforwards are not expected to be utilized before their expiration.  In accordance with GAAP, PNMR and PNM have impaired the tax carryforwards which were not expected to be utilized prior to their expiration.  During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the impairment of the New Mexico net operating loss carryforward recorded in 2014 was refined, resulting in an additional impairment of   $1.0 million  , after federal income tax benefit,   $0.7 million   of which was recorded by PNM and   $0.3 million   was recorded in the Corporate and Other segment.  TNMP had   no   such impairment in 2015.  The Company has   not   recorded any impairments in 2016.  The NMPRC s final order in PNM s NM 2015 Rate Case (Note   12  ) approved PNM s request to record a regulatory asset to recover a 2014 impairment of PNM s New Mexico net operating loss carryforward resulting from the extension of bonus depreciation.  The impact, net of federal income taxes, amounts to   $2.1 million  , which is reflected as a reduction of income tax expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

The Company undertook an analysis of interest income and interest expense applicable to federal income tax matters.  The analysis encompassed the impacts of IRS examinations, amended income tax returns, and filings for carrybacks of tax matters to previous taxable years applicable to all years not closed under the IRS rules.  As a result of this effort, PNMR received net refunds from the IRS of   $6.5 million   in the three months ended June 30, 2016.  Of the refunds,   $2.1 million   was recorded as a reduction of interest receivable and   $5.1 million   was recorded as interest income, which was partially offset by   $0.7 million   of interest expense.  In addition, PNMR incurred   $0.9 million   in professional fees related to the analysis.  Of the net pre-tax impacts aggregating   $3.5 million  ,   $2.6 million   is reflected in the PNM segment,   $0.3 million   in the TNMP segment, and   $0.6 million   in the Corporate and Other segment.

    Related Party Transactions 
       
  PNMR, PNM, and TNMP are considered related parties as defined under GAAP.  PNMR Services Company provides corporate services to PNMR and its subsidiaries in accordance with shared services agreements.  The table below summarizes the nature and amount of related party transactions of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP:   

The excess purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by PNMR for its 2005 acquisition of TNP was recorded as goodwill and was pushed down to the businesses acquired.  In 2007, the TNMP assets that were included in its New Mexico operations, including goodwill, were transferred to PNM. 
    
  GAAP requires the Company to evaluate its goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired.  PNMR s reporting units that have goodwill are PNM and TNMP.  Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.   
    
  GAAP provides that in certain circumstances an entity may perform a qualitative analysis to conclude that the goodwill of a reporting unit is not impaired.  Under a qualitative assessment an entity would consider macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, other relevant entity-specific events affecting a reporting unit, as well as whether  a sustained decrease (both absolute and relative to its peers) in share price had occurred.  An entity would consider the extent to which each of the adverse events and circumstances identified could affect the comparison of a reporting unit s fair value with its carrying amount.  An entity should place more weight on the events and circumstances that most affect a reporting unit s fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets.  An entity also should consider positive and mitigating events and circumstances that may affect its determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is

less than its carrying amount.  An entity would evaluate, on the basis of the weight of evidence, the significance of all identified events and circumstances in the context of determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative analysis is not required.   
    
  In other circumstances, an entity may perform a quantitative analysis to reach the conclusion regarding impairment with respect to a reporting unit.  The first step of the quantitative impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill.  If as a result of this analysis, the entity concludes there is an indication of impairment in a reporting unit having goodwill, the entity is required to perform the second step of the impairment analysis, determining the amount of goodwill impairment to be recorded.  The amount is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount.  This exercise would require the entity to allocate the fair value determined in step one to the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.  Any remaining fair value would be the implied fair value of goodwill on the testing date.  To the extent the recorded amount of goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value determined in step two, an impairment loss would be reflected in results of operations. 
    
  An entity may choose to perform a quantitative analysis without performing a qualitative analysis and may perform a qualitative analysis for certain reporting units but a quantitative analysis for others.  For its annual evaluations performed as of April 1, 2016, PNMR performed quantitative analyses for both the PNM and TNMP reporting units.  PNMR utilized a quantitative analysis for the PNM reporting unit and a qualitative analysis for the TNMP reporting unit as of April 1, 2015.  For the quantitative analyses, a discounted cash flow methodology was primarily used to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.  This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of long-term growth rates for the business, and determination of appropriate weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit.  Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the conclusion of impairment. 
    
  The annual evaluations performed as of April 1, 2016 and 2015 did not indicate impairments of the goodwill of any of PNMR s reporting units.  The April 1, 2016 and 2015 quantitative evaluations indicated the fair value of the PNM reporting unit, which has goodwill of   $51.6 million  , exceeded its carrying value by approximately   25%   and   25%  .   The April 1, 2016 quantitative evaluation indicated the fair value of the TNMP reporting unit, which has goodwill of   $226.7 million  , exceeded its carrying value by approximately   32%  .  Since the April 1, 2016 annual evaluation, there have been no indications that the fair values of the reporting units with recorded goodwill have decreased below the carrying values.  Additional information concerning the Company s goodwill is contained in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.

MD A FOR PNMR 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
  Overview and Strategy       
    
  PNMR is a holding company with two regulated utilities serving approximately 765,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers and end-users of electricity in New Mexico and Texas.  PNMR s electric utilities are PNM and TNMP. 
  Strategic Goals    
   PNMR is focused on achieving three key strategic goals:  

Earning authorized returns on regulated businesses 
                
    Delivering above industry-average earnings and dividend growth 
                
    Maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings 
       
  In conjunction with these goals, PNM and TNMP are dedicated to: 

Maintaining strong employee safety, plant performance, and system reliability 
                
    Delivering a superior customer experience 
                
    Demonstrating environmental leadership in their business operations   
                
    Supporting the communities in their service territories 
       
  Earning Authorized Returns on Regulated Businesses     
    
  PNMR s success in accomplishing its strategic goals is highly dependent on two key factors:  fair and timely regulatory treatment for its utilities and the utilities  strong operating performance.  The Company has multiple strategies to achieve favorable regulatory treatment, all of which have as their foundation a focus on the basics: safety, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction, while engaging stakeholders to build productive relationships.  Both PNM and TNMP seek cost recovery for their investments through general rate cases and various rate riders.  
    
  Fair and timely rate treatment from regulators is crucial to PNM and TNMP in earning their allowed returns, which is critical for PNMR s ability to achieve its strategic goals.  PNMR believes that if the utilities earn their allowed returns, it would be viewed positively by credit rating agencies and would further improve the Company s ratings, which could lower costs to utility customers.  Also, earning allowed returns should result in increased earnings for PNMR, which would lead to increased growth in EPS. 
    
  Additional information about rate filings is provided in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K and in Note 12.  
    
  State Regulation 
    
  New Mexico Rate Case     On August 27, 2015, PNM filed an application with the NMPRC for a general increase in retail electric rates (the  NM 2015 Rate Case ).  Key aspects of PNM s request were: 

An increase in base non-fuel revenues of $121.5 million

     Table of Contents  

Drivers of revenue deficiency 
        Infrastructure investments 
             
    Declines in forecasted energy sales due to successful energy efficiency programs and other economic factors 
                
    Proposed changes to rate design to establish fair and equitable pricing across rate classes and to better align cost recovery with cost causation 
        Increased customer and demand charges 
     A revenue decoupling pilot program applicable to residential and small commercial customers 
     Re-allocation of revenue among customer classes 
     A new economic development rate 
     Continuation of PNM s renewable energy rider 
    
  Hearings were held in April and June of 2016.  On August 4, 2016, the hearing examiner in the case issued a recommended decision ( RD ).  The RD proposed an increase in non-fuel revenues of $41.3 million compared to the $121.5 million increase requested by PNM.  Major components of the difference in the increase in non-fuel revenues, include: 

The RD proposed disallowing recovery of the entire $163.3 million purchase price for the January 15, 2016 purchases of the assets underlying leases of portions of PVNGS Unit 2 (Note 6), aggregating 64.1 MW of capacity 
                
    The RD proposed that PNM not recover from retail customers any of the $18.1 million of annual rent expense under leases of capacity, aggregating 114.6 MW, in PVNGS Units 1 and 2 that were extended for eight years beginning January 15, 2015 and 2016 (Note 6);  
                
    The RD also proposed that property taxes on the previously leased assets and the extended leases not be recovered from retail customers; the property taxes aggregate $2.3 million annually 
                
    The RD proposed that PNM not recover the costs of converting SJGS Units 1 and 4 to BDT, which is required by the NSR permit for SJGS, (Note 11);  PNM s share of the costs of installing the BDT equipment was $52.3 million of which $40.0 million was included in rate base in PNM s current rate request 
                
    The RD proposed that $4.5 million of amounts recorded as regulatory assets and deferred charges  not be recovered from retail customers 
       
  The RD recommended that the NMPRC find PNM was imprudent in the actions taken to purchase the previously leased 64.1 MW of capacity in PVNGS Unit 2, extending the leases for 114.6 MW of capacity of PVNGS Units 1 and 2, and installing the BDT equipment on SJGS Units 1 and 4.  The RD also proposed changes in the methods of recovering certain costs through PNM s FPPAC and renewable energy rider.  The RD credited retail customers with 100% of the New Mexico jurisdictional portion of revenues from refined coal (a third-party pre-treatment process) at SJGS.  The RD recommended continuation of the renewable energy rider and certain aspects of PNM s proposals regarding rate design, but would not approve certain other rate design proposals or PNM s request for a revenue decoupling pilot program.  The RD proposed approving PNM s proposals for revised depreciation rates (with one exception), the inclusion of CWIP in rate base, and ratemaking treatment of the prepaid pension asset.  The RD did not preclude PNM from supporting the prudence of the PVNGS purchases and lease renewals in its next general rate case and seeking recovery of those costs.  PNM disagreed with many of the key conclusions reached by the hearing examiner in the RD and filed exceptions to those conclusions.  Other parties also filed exceptions to the RD.   
    
  The NMPRC issued a final order on September 28, 2016 that authorizes PNM to implement an increase in non-fuel rates of $61.2 million, effective for bills sent after September 30, 2016.  The final order generally approved the RD, but with certain significant modifications.  The modifications to the RD include: 

Inclusion of the January 2016 purchase of the assets underlying three leases of capacity, aggregating 64.1 MW, of PVNGS Unit 2  at an initial rate base value of $83.7 million; and disallowance of the recovery of the undepreciated costs of capitalized improvements made during the period the 64.1 MW was being leased by PNM, which aggregated $43.8 million when the final order was issued  
                
    Full recovery of the rent expense and property taxes associated with the extended leases for capacity, aggregating 114.6 MW, in Palo Verde Units 1 and 2 
                
    Disallowance of the recovery of any future contribution for PVNGS decommissioning costs related to the 64.1 MW of capacity purchased in January 2016 and the 114.6 MW of  capacity under the extended leases 
                
    Recovery of assumed operating and maintenance expense savings of $0.3 million annually related to BDT

On September 30, 2016, PNM filed a Notice of Appeal with the NM Supreme Court regarding the order in the NM 2015 Rate Case.  Subsequently, NEE, NMIEC, and ABCWUA filed notices of cross appeal.  On October 26, 2016, PNM filed, with the NM Supreme Court, a statement of issues related to its appeal, which states PNM is appealing the NMPRC s determination that PNM was imprudent in the actions taken to purchase the previously leased 64.1 MW of capacity in PVNGS Unit 2, extending the leases for 114.6 MW of capacity of PVNGS Units 1 and 2, and installing the BDT equipment on SJGS Units 1 and 4.  Specifically, PNM s statement indicated it is appealing the following elements of the NMPRC s final order: 

Disallowance of recovery of the full purchase price, representing fair market value, of the 64.1 MW of capacity in PVNGS Unit 2 purchased in January 2016 
                
    Disallowance of the recovery of the undepreciated costs of capitalized improvements made during the period the 64.1 MW of capacity was leased by PNM 
                
    Disallowance of recovery of future contributions for PVNGS decommissioning attributable to previously leased capacity 
                
    Disallowance of recovery of the costs of converting SJGS Units 1 and 4 to BDT 
       
  The court has taken no action with respect to the appeals.  Although appeals of regulatory actions of the NMPRC have a priority at the NM Supreme Court under New Mexico law, there is no required time frame for the court to act on the appeals.   
    
  As of September 30, 2016, PNM evaluated the accounting consequences of the final order in the NM 2015 Rate Case and the likelihood of being successful on the issues it is appealing in the NM Supreme Court as required under GAAP.  The evaluation indicates it is reasonably possible that PNM will be successful on the issues it is appealing.  If the NM Supreme Court rules in PNM s favor on some or all of the issues, those issues would be remanded back to the NMPRC for further action.  PNM estimates that it will take a minimum of 15 months, from the date PNM filed its appeal, for the NM Supreme Court to render a decision and for the NMPRC to take action on any remanded issues.  During such time, the rates specified in the final order will remain in effect.  Accordingly, at September 30, 2016, PNM recorded a pre-tax regulatory disallowance of $11.3 million representing 15 months of capital cost recovery on its investments that the final order disallowed and amounts recorded as regulatory assets and deferred charges that the final order disallowed.   
    
  PNM continues to believe that the disallowed investments, which are the subject of PNM s appeal, were prudently incurred and that PNM is entitled to full recovery of those investments through the ratemaking process.  Although PNM believes it is reasonably possible that its appeals will be successful, it cannot predict what decision the NM Supreme Court will reach or what further actions the NMPRC will take on any issued remanded to it by the court.  If PNM s appeal is unsuccessful, PNM would record additional pre-tax losses related to any unsuccessful issues. If the appeal is unsuccessful on all issues, the additional losses could aggregate $168.5 million based on the September 30, 2016 book values of PNM s investments that the final order disallowed, after considering the loss recorded at September 30, 2016. 
    
  PNM is unable to predict the outcome of this matter. 
    
  PVNGS Unit 3         Currently, PNM s 134 MW interest in PVNGS Unit 3 is excluded from NMPRC jurisdictional rates.  The power generated from that interest is sold into the wholesale market and any earnings or losses are realized by shareholders.  As part of compliance with the requirements for BART at SJGS discussed below, the NMPRC approved including PVNGS Unit 3 as a jurisdictional resource in the determination of rates charged to customers in New Mexico beginning in 2018. 
    
  Rate Riders and Interim Rate Relief         The PUCT has approved mechanisms that allow TNMP to recover capital invested in transmission and distribution projects without having to file a general rate case.  This permits more timely recovery of investments.  The PUCT has also approved riders that allow TNMP to recover amounts related to AMS, energy efficiency, third-party transmission costs, and the CTC.  The NMPRC has approved rate riders for renewable energy and energy efficiency that allow for more timely recovery of investments and improve PNM s ability to earn its authorized return.   
    
  TNMP General Rate Case     TNMP s last general rate case was filed in 2010 with new rates becoming effective on February 1, 2011.  In connection with TNMP s deployment of its advance meter system (Note 12), TNMP has committed to file a general rate case no later than September 1, 2018.  TNMP has also committed that it would not file a request for an increase in rates under the PUCT s rule permitting interim rate adjustments to reflect changes in investments in distribution assets until after the 2018 general rate case.

FERC Regulation 
    
  In early 2013, PNM completed rate proceedings for all of its FERC regulated transmission customers and for NEC, its largest generation services customer, which improved PNM s returns for providing those services.  PNM has allocated a portion of its generation assets to serve FERC wholesale generation services customers for a number of years.  Recently, the low natural gas price environment has caused market prices for power to be substantially lower than what PNM is able to offer wholesale customers under the cost of service model that FERC requires PNM to use.  As a result of this change in market conditions, PNM has not been earning an adequate return on the assets required to serve wholesale contracts.  Consequently, PNM has decided to stop pursuing wholesale contracts that are served with the same generation assets that serve retail customers. 
    
  Navopache Electric Cooperative, Inc.         PNM had a PSA to supply power to NEC that was approved by FERC in April 2013.  On April 8, 2015, NEC filed a petition for a declaratory order requesting that FERC find that NEC can purchase an unlimited amount of power and energy from third party supplier(s) under the PSA.  PNM intervened, requesting that FERC deny NEC s petition.  On July 16, 2015, FERC set the matter for a public hearing concerning the parties  intent with regard to certain provisions of the PSA and held the hearing in abeyance to provide time for settlement judge procedures.  
    
  On October 29, 2015, PNM and NEC entered into, and filed with FERC, a settlement agreement that includes amendments to the PSA and related contracts.  FERC approved the settlement in January 2016.  Under the agreement, PNM will serve all of NEC s load in 2016 at reduced demand and energy rates from those under the PSA.  Beginning January 1, 2016, NEC is also paying certain third-party transmission costs that it did not pay in 2014 and only partially paid in 2015.  The PSA, which contained an expiration date in 2035, will terminate on December 31, 2016.  In 2017, PNM will continue to serve 10 MW of NEC s load under a short-term coordination tariff at a rate lower than provided under the PSA, but higher than prices available under short-term market rates at the time of the settlement.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenues were $14.8 million and $19.7 million under the PSA.  Although the settlement agreement will negatively impact results of operations in 2016 and 2017, PNM expects to be able to mitigate these impacts through market sales of power that would have been sold to NEC, reductions in fuel and transmission expenses, and other measures.  PNM anticipates that, in future general rate cases, assets and costs previously assigned to serve NEC will be reassigned, primarily to retail customers. 
    
  Transmission Service Formula Rate Mechanism         PNM filed a request with FERC for an increase in rates charged to transmission customers based on a formula rate mechanism.  On March 20, 2015, PNM along with five other parties entered into a settlement agreement, which FERC approved on March 17, 2016.  The settlement reflects a ROE of 10% and resulted in an annualized increase in rates of $1.3 million above the rates approved in the previous case.  
  Delivering Above Industry-Average Earnings and Dividend Growth  
  PNMR s strategic goal to deliver above industry-average earnings and dividend growth enables investors to realize the value in the Company s business.  PNMR s current target is seven to eight percent earnings growth through 2019.  Earnings growth is based on ongoing earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes from earnings determined in accordance with GAAP certain non-recurring, infrequent, and other items that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company s operations.  PNMR uses ongoing earnings to evaluate the operations of the Company and to establish goals, including those used for certain aspects of incentive compensation, for management and employees.  
  PNMR targets a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of its ongoing earnings.  PNMR expects to provide above industry-average dividend growth in the near-term and to manage the payout ratio to meet its long-term target.  The Board will continue to evaluate the dividend on an annual basis, considering sustainability and growth, capital planning, and industry standards.  The Board approved the following increases in the indicated annual common stock dividend:

Maintaining Solid Investment Grade Credit Ratings 
  The Company is committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings in order to reduce the cost of debt financing and to help ensure access to credit markets, when required.  See the subheading Liquidity included in the full discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources below for the specific credit ratings for PNMR, PNM, and TNMP.  Currently, all of the credit ratings issued by both Moody s and S P on the Company s debt are investment grade with a stable outlook. 
    
  Business Focus 
    
  PNMR strives to create enduring value for customers, communities, and shareholders.  PNMR s strategy and decision-making are focused on safely providing reliable, affordable, and environmentally responsible power.  PNMR works closely with customers, stakeholders, legislators, and regulators to ensure that resource plans and infrastructure investments benefit from robust public dialogue and balance the diverse needs of our communities.  Equally important are PNMR s utilities  focus on customer satisfaction and community engagement. 
    
  Reliable and Affordable Power 
  PNMR and its utilities are aware of the important roles they play in enhancing economic vitality in their service territories.  Management believes that maintaining strong and modern electric infrastructure is critical to ensuring reliability and supporting economic growth.  When contemplating expanding or relocating their operations, businesses consider energy affordability and reliability to be important factors.  PNM and TNMP strive to balance service affordability with infrastructure investment to maintain a high level of electric reliability and to deliver a superior customer experience.  
  Investing in PNM s and TNMP s infrastructure is critical to ensuring reliability and meeting future energy needs.  Both utilities have long-established records of providing customers with reliable electric service.  Through 2014, both PNM and TNMP ranked in the top quartile nationally for reliability for three out of the previous five years.  In 2014, PNM delivered its best reliability performance in the past seven years and TNMP s reliability was its best in a decade.  PNM was again ranked in the electric utility industry top (first) quartile for 2015 despite 2015 being one of the wettest years on record in New Mexico, whereas TNMP s reliability was ranked in the third quartile as it was more negatively impacted by severe weather events accompanied with record amounts of rain in certain areas of Texas. 
  Advanced Metering 
  In September 2011, TNMP began its deployment of advanced meters for homes and businesses across its Texas service area.  As of   September 30, 2016  , TNMP had completed its mass deployment by installing more than 242,000 advanced meters.  As part of the State of Texas  long-term initiative to create an advanced electric grid, installation of advanced meters will ultimately give consumers more data about their energy consumption and help them make more informed decisions.  In addition, TNMP recently completed installation of a new outage management system that will leverage capabilities of the advanced metering infrastructure to enhance TNMP s responsiveness to outages. 
    
  On February 26, 2016, PNM filed an application with the NMPRC requesting approval of a project to replace its existing customer metering equipment with Advanced Metering Infrastructure ( AMI ).  The application also asks the NMPRC to authorize the recovery, in future ratemaking proceedings, of the cost of the project, up to $87.2 million, as well as to approve the recovery of the remaining undepreciated investment in existing metering equipment estimated to be approximately $33 million and the costs of customer education and severance for any affected employees.  PNM does not intend to proceed with the AMI project unless the NMPRC approves the entire application.  On August 5, 2016, PNM filed a motion to suspend its AMI application so that it could evaluate the effect of the final order in the NM 2015 Rate Case.  This motion was approved and PNM must either propose a new procedural schedule or file a motion to withdraw the AMI application by November 28, 2016.  PNM cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
    
  Utility Plant Investments 
    
  During the 2013 to 2015 period, PNM and TNMP together invested $1,302.4 million in utility plant, including substations, power plants, nuclear fuel, and transmission and distribution systems.  In 2012, PNM announced plans for the 40 MW natural gas-fired La Luz peaking generating station to be located near Belen, New Mexico.  Construction began in April 2015 and the facility went into service in December 2015.  In addition, on January 15, 2016, PNM completed the $163.3 million acquisition of 64 MW of capacity in PVNGS Unit 2 that had previously been leased to PNM.

Integrated Resource Plan 
    
  NMPRC rules require that investor-owned utilities file an IRP every   three   years.  The IRP is required to cover a   20  -year planning period and contain an action plan covering the first four years of that period.  PNM filed its 2014 IRP on July 1, 2014.  The four-year action plan was consistent with the replacement resources identified in PNM s application to retire SJGS Units 2 and 3.  PNM indicated that it planned to meet its anticipated energy demand with a combination of additional renewable energy resources, energy efficiency, and natural gas-fired facilities.  
    
  PNM has begun its process for the 2017 IRP that is to be filed by July 3, 2017.  In the NMPRC s final order concerning SJGS  compliance with the BART requirements of the CAA discussed in Note 11, PNM is required to make a filing in 2018 to determine the extent to which SJGS should continue serving PNM s retail customers  needs after June 30, 2022.  To facilitate the 2018 filing, PNM anticipates developing two resource portfolios in the 2017 IRP, one with SJGS continuing beyond 2022 and one where it is shutdown.   
  Environmentally Responsible Power  
  PNMR has a long-standing record of environmental stewardship.  PNM s environmental focus has been in three key areas: 

Developing strategies to meet regional haze rules at the coal-fired SJGS as cost-effectively as possible while providing broad environmental benefits that also demonstrate progress in addressing new federal regulations for CO   2    emissions from existing power plants 
                
    Preparing to meet New Mexico s increasing renewable energy requirements as cost-effectively as possible 
                
    Increasing energy efficiency participation 
       
  SJGS 
    
  Regional Haze Rule Compliance Plan     On December 16, 2015, PNM received NMPRC approval for the plan to comply with the EPA regional haze rule at SJGS that minimizes the cost impact to customers while still achieving broad environmental benefits.  Under the approved plan, the installation of SNCRs on SJGS Units 1 and 4 was completed in early 2016 and Units 2 and 3 will be retired by the end of 2017.  The plan provides for similar visibility improvements, but at a lower cost to PNM customers than a previous EPA ruling that would have required the installation of more expensive SCRs on all four units at SJGS.  The plan has the added advantage of reducing other emissions in addition to NOx, including SO   2   , particulate matter, CO   2   , and mercury, as well as reducing water usage.  Additional information is contained in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K and in Note 11. 
    
  Under the key provisions of the order approving the compliance plan, PNM: 

Will retire SJGS Units 2 and 3 (PNM s current ownership interest totals 418 MW) at December 31, 2017 and recover, over 20 years, 50% (currently estimated to be approximately $128.6 million) of their undepreciated net book value at that date and earn a regulated return on those costs 
                
    Is granted a CCN to acquire an additional 132 MW in SJGS Unit 4, with an initial book value of zero, plus SNCR costs and whatever portion of BDT costs the NMPRC determines to be reasonable and prudent to be allowed for recovery in rates  (Note 12) 
                
    Is granted a CCN for 134 MW of PVNGS Unit 3 with an initial rate base value equal to the book value as of December 31, 2017 (estimated to be approximately $152 million) 
                
    Is authorized to acquire 65 MW of SJGS Unit 4 as merchant utility plant, which will not be included in rates charged to retail customers 
                
    Will accelerate recovery of SNCR costs on SJGS Units 1 and 4 so that the costs are fully recovered by July 1, 2022  
                
    Is required to make a NMPRC filing in 2018 to determine the extent that SJGS should continue serving PNM s customers  needs after mid-2022  
                
    Will acquire and retire one MWh of RECs that include a zero-CO   2    emission attribute beginning January 1, 2020 for every MWh produced by 197 MW of coal-fired generation from PNM s ownership share of SJGS (the cost of these RECs would be capped at $7.0 million per year and recovered in rates) 
                
    Will not recover approximately $20 million of increased operations and maintenance expenses and other costs incurred in connection with CAA compliance

At December 31, 2015, PNM recorded pre-tax losses aggregating $165.7 million to reflect the write-off of the 50% of the estimated December 31, 2017 net book value of SJGS Units 2 and 3 that will not be recovered, the other unrecoverable costs, and the increase in the estimated liability recorded for coal mine reclamation resulting from the new coal mine reclamation arrangement entered into in conjunction with the new coal supply agreement ( CSA ).  In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, PNM recorded additional pre-tax losses of $6.0 million resulting from revised estimates of these items.  Additional information about the CSA is discussed below and further described under Coal Supply in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K and in Note 11.   
    
  On January 14, 2016, NEE filed, with the NM Supreme Court, a Notice of Appeal of the NMPRC s December 16, 2015 final order.  On March 31, 2016, NEE filed, with the NMPRC, a complaint against PNM regarding the financing provided by NM Capital to facilitate the sale of SJCC.  The complaint alleges that PNM failed to comply with its discovery obligation in the SJGS abandonment case and requests the NMPRC to investigate whether the financing transactions could adversely affect PNM s ability to provide electric service to its retail customers.  PNM responded to the complaint on May 4, 2016.  The NMPRC has taken no action on this matter.  
    
  SJGS Ownership Restructuring         In connection with the proposed retirement of SJGS Units 2 and 3, some of the SJGS participants expressed a desire to exit their ownership in the plant.  As a result, the SJGS participants negotiated a restructuring of the ownership in SJGS and addressed the obligations of the exiting participants for plant decommissioning, mine reclamation, environmental matters, and certain future operating costs, among other items. 
    
  The San Juan Project Restructuring Agreement ( RA ) sets forth the agreement among the SJGS owners regarding ownership restructuring.  Key provisions of the RA include: 

Capacity acquisition   On December 31, 2017, PNM will acquire 132 MW of the exiting owners  capacity in SJGS Unit 4 and PNMR Development agreed to acquire 65 MW of such capacity.  It is currently anticipated that PNMR Development will transfer the rights and obligations related to the 65 MW to PNM prior to December 31, 2017 in order to facilitate dispatch of power from that capacity.  As ordered by the NMPRC, PNM would treat the 65 MW as merchant utility plant that would be excluded from retail rates.   
                
    Coal inventory   The RA also sets forth the terms under which PNM acquired the coal inventory of the exiting SJGS participants as of January 1, 2016 and will provide coal supply to the exiting participants during the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017, which arrangement provides economic benefits that are being passed on to PNM s customers through the FPPAC.  
                
    Coal supply   The RA became effective contemporaneously with the effectiveness of the new CSA for SJGS.  The effectiveness of the new CSA was dependent on the closing of the purchase of the existing coal mine operation by a new mine operator, which occurred on January 31, 2016.  In support of the closing of the mine purchase and to facilitate PNM customer savings, NM Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of PNMR, provided funding of $125.0 million to Westmoreland San Juan, LLC ( WSJ ), a ring-fenced, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose entity that is a subsidiary of Westmoreland Coal Company to finance the purchase price.  NM Capital was able to provide the $125.0 million financing to WSJ by first entering into a $125.0 million term loan agreement with a commercial bank.  PNMR guarantees NM Capital s obligations to the bank.  The Westmoreland Loan has a maturity date of February 1, 2021 and initially bears interest at a rate of 7.25% plus LIBOR and escalates over time.  WSJ must pay principal and interest quarterly to NM Capital in accordance with an amortization schedule.  The Westmoreland Loan has been structured to encourage prepayments and early retirement of the debt.  As of October 21, 2016, the balance of the Westmoreland Loan was $110.0 million and $17.3 million was held in a restricted bank account that will be used to make a $15.0 million principal payment on the Westmoreland Loan and interest of $2.3 million, which are due on November 1, 2016. 
                
    Coal mine reclamation   Under the terms of the CSA, PNM and the other SJGS owners are obligated to compensate SJCC for all reclamation liabilities associated with the supply of coal from the San Juan mine.  In connection with certain mining permits relating to the operation of the San Juan mine, SJCC is required to post reclamation bonds, which currently aggregate $118.7 million, with the NMMMD.  PNMR has arrangements under which a bank has issued $30.3 million in letters of credit to facilitate posting of the required reclamation bonds.  See Note 11.  
     Other SJGS Environmental Matters         In addition to the regional haze rule, SJGS is required to comply with other rules currently being developed or implemented that affect coal-fired generating units, including rules regarding GHG under Section 111(d) of the CAA.  Implementation of the Clean Power Plan, which was published by EPA in October 2015, is currently stayed by order of the US Supreme Court pending further proceedings before the DC Circuit.  Oral argument was heard by the DC Circuit in September 2016, but the court has taken no action.  PNM estimates that implementation of the BART plan at SJGS discussed  
  
    82 

     Table of Contents  

above should provide a significant step for New Mexico to meet its ultimate compliance with Section 111(d).  PNM is unable to predict the impact of this rule on its fossil-fueled generation. 
  Because of environmental upgrades completed in 2009, SJGS is well positioned to outperform the mercury limit imposed by EPA in the 2011 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.  The major environmental upgrades on each of the four units at SJGS have significantly reduced emissions of NOx, SO   2   , particulate matter, and mercury.  Since 2006, SJGS has reduced NOx emissions by 49%, SO   2    by 77%, particulate matter by 78%, and mercury by 98%. 
  Water Conservation and Solid Waste Reduction 
  PNM continues its efforts to reduce the amount of fresh water used to make electricity (about 25% more efficient than in 2002).  Continued growth in PNM s fleet of solar, wind, and geothermal energy sources, energy efficiency programs, and innovative uses of gray water and air-cooling technology have contributed to this reduction.  Water usage will continue to decline as PNM substitutes less fresh-water-intensive generation resources to replace SJGS Units 2 and 3 starting in 2018 when water consumption at that plant will be reduced by around 50%.  Focusing on responsible stewardship of New Mexico s scarce water resources improves PNM s water-resilience in the face of persistent drought and ever-increasing demands for water to spur the growth of New Mexico s economy.  In addition to the above areas of focus, the Company is working to reduce the amount of solid waste going to landfills through increased recycling and reduction of waste.  In 2015, 20 of the Company s 23 facilities exceeded a 60% diversion rate, often by a wide margin.  The Company expects to continue to do well in this area in the future. 
  Renewable Energy 
  PNM s renewable procurement strategy includes utility-owned solar capacity, as well as wind and geothermal energy purchased under PPAs.  As of December 31, 2015, PNM owned 107 MW of utility-scale solar capacity, including 40 MW completed in 2015.  The application for a general rate increase discussed above includes recovery of the costs associated with the new 40 MW solar facilities.  As discussed in Note 12, PNMR Development will construct and own 30 MW of new solar capacity that PNM will use to supply power to new data center being constructed by Facebook Inc. in PNM s service territory.  In addition, PNM purchases power from a customer-owned distributed solar generation program that had an installed capacity of 57.3 MW at September 30, 2016.  PNM also owns the 500 KW PNM Prosperity Energy Storage Project, which uses advanced batteries to store solar power and dispatch the energy either during high-use periods or when solar production is limited.  The project was one of the first combinations of battery storage and PV energy in the nation and involved extensive research and development of advanced grid concepts.  The facility was also the nation s first solar storage facility fully integrated into a utility s power grid.  Since 2003, PNM has purchased the output from a 204 MW wind facility and began purchasing the output of another existing 102 MW wind energy center on January 1, 2015.  PNM has a 20-year agreement to purchase energy from a geothermal facility built near Lordsburg, New Mexico.  The facility began providing power to PNM in January 2014.  The current capacity of the geothermal facility is 4 MW and future expansion may result in up to 9 MW of generation capacity.  PNM also purchases RECs as necessary to meet the RPS.   
  These renewable resources are key means for PNM to meet the RPS and related regulations that require PNM to achieve prescribed levels of energy sales from renewable sources, if that can be accomplished without exceeding the RCT limit set by the NMPRC.  PNM makes renewable procurements consistent with the plans approved by the NMPRC.  PNM s 2016 renewable energy procurement plan meets RPS and diversity requirements within the RCT in 2016 and 2017.  PNM s 2017 renewable energy procurement plan meets RPS and diversity requirements for 2017 and 2018 using existing resources and does not propose any significant new procurements.  PNM projects that its plan will slightly exceed the RCT in 2017 and  has requested a variance from the RCT , but will be within the RCT in 2018.  The NMPRC must enter an order approving or modifying the plan by November 28, 2016.  PNM will continue to procure renewable resources while balancing the impact to customers  bills in order to meet New Mexico s escalating RPS requirements. 
  Energy Efficiency  
  Energy efficiency also plays a significant role in helping to keep customers  electricity costs low while continuing to meet their energy needs.  PNM s and TNMP s energy efficiency and load management portfolios continue to achieve robust results.  In 2015, annual energy saved as a result of PNM s portfolio of energy efficiency programs was approximately 79 GWh.  This is equivalent to the annual consumption of approximately 10,900 homes in PNM s service territory.  PNM s load management and energy efficiency programs also help lower peak demand requirements.  TNMP s energy efficiency programs in 2015 resulted in energy savings totaling an estimated 18 GWh.  This is equivalent to the annual consumption of approximately 1,660 homes in TNMP s service territory.

Customer, Stakeholder, and Community Engagement  
    
  The Company strives to deliver a superior customer experience by understanding the dynamic needs of its customers through ongoing market research, identifying and establishing best-in-class services and programs, and proactively communicating and engaging with customers at regional and community levels.  Beginning in 2013, PNM refocused its efforts to improve the customer experience through an integrated marketing and communications strategy that encompassed brand repositioning and advertising, customer service improvements, including billing and payment options, and strategic customer and stakeholder engagement.  PNM s focus on these efforts has resulted in increasing scores in the JD Power Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study.  
  Through outreach, collaboration, and various community-oriented programs, PNMR has a demonstrated commitment to build productive relationships with stakeholders, including customers, regulators, legislators, and intervenors.  
  The PNM Resources Foundation helps nonprofits become more energy efficient through Reduce Your Use grants.  In each of 2015 and 2016, the foundation has awarded $0.3 million to support 54 projects in New Mexico to provide shade structure installations, window replacements, and efficient appliance purchases.  Since the program s inception in 2008, Reduce Your Use grants have provided nonprofit agencies in New Mexico with more than $2.1 million of support.  In 2014, the PNM Resources Foundation launched a new grant program designed to help nonprofit organizations build more vibrant communities.  In 2015 and 2016, Power Up Grants in the aggregate amount of $0.5 million and $0.5 million were awarded to 34 and 29 nonprofits in New Mexico and Texas for projects ranging from creating community gathering spaces to revitalizing neighborhood parks to building a youth sports field. 
    
  PNM 
    
  Stakeholder Outreach         PNM continues to expand its key stakeholder outreach to various organizations including business and economic development, environmental and nonprofit organizations, as well as state and local elected officials.  Community meetings, one-on-one briefings, and e-newsletter communications are just some of the tools being used to reach a wide array of stakeholders on key PNM issues including environmental commitment, infrastructure investments, price increases, energy savings opportunities, and other timely issues. Recent customer awareness scores have increased regarding PNM s commitment to the environment, the community, and energy efficiency programs.  
    
  Communications         PNM also has expanded its integrated communication efforts, including increased social media efforts, radio, television, newspaper and digital advertising, fact sheets for stakeholders on key PNM issues, e-newsletters, and identification and participation in key stakeholder events.  Communication is a major driver for JD Power customer satisfaction scores.  PNM s websites, www.pnm.com and www.PowerforProgress.com, provide the details of major regulatory filings, including general rate requests, as well as the background on PNM s efforts to maintain reliability, keep prices affordable, and protect the environment.  The websites are designed to be a resource for the facts about PNM s operations and community support efforts, including plans for building a sustainable energy future for New Mexico. 
    
  Low-income Customer Outreach         PNM continues its outreach efforts to connect low-income customers with nonprofit community service providers offering support and help with such needs as utility bills, food, clothing, medical programs, services for seniors, and weatherization.  In 2015, PNM hosted 38 community events throughout its service territory to assist low-income customers.  Furthermore, the PNM Good Neighbor Fund provided $0.4 million of assistance with utility bills to 3,554 families in 2015.  In 2015, PNM committed funding of $0.6 million to the PNM Good Neighbor Fund. 
    
  TNMP 
    
  Community Outreach         In Texas, community outreach is centered first on local relationships, specifically with community leaders, nonprofit organizations, and key customers in areas served by TNMP.  Community liaisons serve in each of TNMP s three business areas, reaching out and ensuring productive lines of communication between TNMP and its key stakeholders.  
    
  TNMP maintains long-standing relationships with several key nonprofit organizations, including agencies that support children and families in crisis, food banks, environmental organizations, and educational nonprofits, through employee volunteerism and corporate support.  TNMP also actively participates in safety fairs and demonstrations in addition to supporting local chambers of commerce in efforts to build their local economies.

Energy Efficiency         TNMP s energy efficiency program discussed above provides unique offers to multiple customer groups, including residential, commercial, government, education, and nonprofit customers.  These programs not only enable peak load and consumption reductions, particularly important when severe weather affects Texas  electric system, but also demonstrate TNMP s commitment to more than just delivering electricity by partnering with customers to optimize their energy usage.  In April 2016, TNMP was recognized by Energy Star for TNMP s successful energy efficiency efforts.  TNMP received the  Partner of the Year Energy Efficiency Delivery Award  for its High-Performance Homes Program.  
  Economic Factors  
  PNM         In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PNM experienced a decrease in weather normalized retail load of 0.6% compared to 2015, primarily due to decreased industrial sales.  PNM has been impacted by a sluggish economy in New Mexico although PNM s  service territory, particularly in the Albuquerque metropolitan area, has recently experienced small business growth.  There have been some recent announcements of businesses moving operations into PNM s service territory, including the selection of a site in New Mexico for a data center by Facebook Inc., and there have been some expansions of existing businesses, particularly in healthcare, education, and professional services.  The employment growth recently in the Albuquerque metro area has been improving with growth of 1.2% for the rolling twelve months ended in September 2016.  New Mexico overall continues to experience softness that is driven primarily by low oil and natural gas prices.  Although PNM does not serve the regions of the state that produce oil and gas, it is anticipated that the impacts of layoffs and the decrease in state royalty revenues will further soften the economies in PNM s service territory to some degree, particularly in the Albuquerque metropolitan area and Santa Fe, as the state deals with budget shortfalls.   
  A large industrial customer of PNM has announced a restructuring initiative, but has not formally announced what impacts, if any, the restructuring would have on its operations in PNM s service territory.  Accordingly, PNM is unable to predict if there will be any impact to its operations.  
  TNMP         In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , TNMP s weather normalized volumetric retail load increased 3.0% compared to 2015 and demand-based load was up 2.9%.  Most of TNMP s industrial and larger commercial customers are billed based on their peak demand.  The Texas economy continues to grow, primarily due to its diverse base, which helps compensate for the weakness in the energy sector that is being impacted by the continued low oil price environment.  Employment growth, particularly in Dallas, continues to increase.  Since the recent recession, Texas has fared better than the national average in job growth and unemployment although there has been some recent softening in job growth, particularly in the Houston area that appears to be related to lower oil prices.  
  Results of Operations 
  Net earnings attributable to PNMR were $92.0 million, or $1.15 per diluted share in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $107.1 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, in 2015.  Among other things, earnings in 2016 benefited from warmer weather in the summer months, including the impacts of rates per KWh being higher in the summer than the rest of the year, increased number of customers, and rate relief at PNM; rate increases and increased load at TNMP; reduced rent expense under the PVNGS leases and plant maintenance costs at PNM; higher interest income; and greater earnings and realized gains on securities held in decommissioning and reclamation trusts compared to the prior year.  However, these increases were more than offset by regulatory disallowances, decreased load at PNM in early 2016, lower sales prices for power from PVNGS Unit 3, lower revenue from NEC, lower equity AFUDC, milder weather at TNMP, a 2015 refund under a FERC tariff for gas transportation agreements, and increased depreciation, property tax, interest, and employee related expenses.  Additional information on factors impacting results of operation for each segment is discussed under Results of Operations below. 
     Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  PNMR has a $300.0 million revolving credit facility and PNM has a $400.0 million revolving credit facility, both of which expire in October 2020.  Both facilities provide capacities for short-term borrowing and letters of credit.  In addition, PNM has a $50.0 million revolving credit facility, which expires in January 2018, with banks having a significant presence in New Mexico and TNMP has a $75.0 million revolving credit facility, which expires in September 2018.  Total availability for PNMR on a consolidated basis was   $592.8 million   at   October 21, 2016  .  The Company utilizes these credit facilities and cash flows from operations to provide funds for both construction and operational expenditures.  PNMR also has intercompany loan agreements with each of its subsidiaries. 
  The Company projects that its total capital requirements, consisting of construction expenditures and dividends, will total   $2,675.0 million   for 2016-2020, including amounts expended through   September 30, 2016  .  The construction expenditures include estimated amounts for environmental upgrades at SJGS and Four Corners, 30 MW of new solar capacity to supply power to a new

data center being constructed by Facebook Inc. (Note 12), and the January 15, 2016 purchase of the assets underlying three of the PVNGS Unit 2 leases at the expiration of those leases.  In addition to internal cash generation, the Company anticipates that it will be necessary to obtain additional long-term financing in the form of debt refinancing, new debt issuances, and/or new equity in order to fund its capital requirements during the 2016-2020 period.  The Company currently believes that its internal cash generation, existing credit arrangements, and access to public and private capital markets will provide sufficient resources to meet the Company s capital requirements.

  Segment Information 
    
  The following discussion is based on the segment methodology that PNMR s management uses for making operating decisions and assessing performance of its various business activities.  See   Note 3   for more information on PNMR s operating segments.   
    
  PNM  
    
  PNM s utility margin is defined as electric operating revenues less cost of energy, which consists primarily of fuel and purchase power costs.  PNM believes that utility margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating operations than electric operating revenues since substantially all fuel and purchase power costs are offset in revenues as those costs are passed through to customers under PNM s FPPAC.  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, fuel and purchased power costs passed through the FPPAC were $16.7 million and $78.8 million less than in 2015, which reduced both revenue and cost of energy.  The decreases reflect lower coal costs at SJGS beginning in 2016 under the new CSA.  See   Note 11  .  In 2015, PNM also was recovering an under-collection of fuel costs that resulted from a prior regulatory proceeding, which amount was fully recovered as of December 31, 2015.  See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.

TNMP  
    
  TNMP s utility margin is defined as electric operating revenues less cost of energy, which consists of costs charged by third-party transmission providers.  TNMP believes that utility margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating operations than electric operating revenues since all third-party transmission costs are passed on to customers through a transmission cost recovery factor.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Statements of Cash Flows 
    
  The changes in PNMR s cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015   are summarized as follows: 

Changes in PNMR s cash flow from operating activities result from net earnings, adjusted for items impacting earnings that do not provide or use cash.  See Results of Operations above.  Certain changes in assets and liabilities resulting from normal operations also impact operating cash flows.  In addition, contributions to PNMR s pension and postretirement benefit plans were $30.0 million lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 than in 2015 due to a $30.0 million contribution to the PNM pension trust in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 that did not recur in 2016.  In addition, PNMR made income tax payments of $0.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to income tax refunds received of $1.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  The changes in PNMR s cash flows from investing activities relate primarily to an increase of $90.9 million in utility plant additions in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015.  Utility plant additions at PNM were $76.2 million higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 than in 2015.  The PNM increase includes the $163.3 million purchase of  
  the assets underlying three of the leases for PVNGS Unit 2 (Note 6) on January 15, 2016 and higher nuclear fuel purchases of $2.8 million, offset by decreases in other generation additions of $69.9 million, including decreases of renewable additions of $52.1 million, and lower transmission and distribution additions of $20.0 million.  TNMP utility plant additions increased $2.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015, including increases in transmission and distribution additions of $2.9 million offset by lower AMS additions of $0.3 million.  Corporate plant additions increased $12.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015, including increases related to PNMR computer hardware and software additions of $15.9 million offset by decreases in utility plant additions related to PNMR Development of $3.7 million.  Investing activities in 2016 also includes the initial funding of the Westmoreland Loan, net of fees, and the $15.0 million principal received on that loan (Note 11). 
    
  The changes in PNMR s cash flows from financing activities include a $108.3 million increase in net short-term borrowing activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015.  In 2016, financing activities include a long-term borrowing, net of fees, of $122.5 million under the BTMU Term Loan Agreement and principal repayments of $17.2 million on that loan.  NM Capital used the proceeds of the BTMU Term Loan Agreement to provide funds for the Westmoreland Loan.  In May 2016, PNM entered into the $175.0 million PNM 2016 Term Loan Agreement and used a portion of the proceeds to prepay $125.0 million outstanding under the PNM Multi-draw Term Loan.  In 2016, PNM also participated in the issuance of $146.0 million of its senior unsecured notes, pollution control revenue bonds to refund the same amount of outstanding PCRBs.  In 2016, TNMP issued $60.0 million of 3.53% first mortgage bonds and used the funds to reduce short-term debt and intercompany debt.  In 2015, long-term borrowings of $150.0 million under the PNMR 2015 Term Loan Agreement were used to repay $118.8 million of 9.25% senior unsecured notes that matured on May 15, 2015 and for general corporate purposes.  In 2015, PNM issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.850% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025.  PNM used the proceeds to repay the $175.0 million PNM 2014 Term Loan agreement and to reduce short-term debt.  In 2015, PNM also participated in the successful remarketing of $39.3 million of senior unsecured notes, pollution control revenue bonds and had $25.0 million of additional long-term borrowings under the PNM Multi-draw Term Loan.   
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Note 9 for additional information concerning the Company s financing activities.  PNM must obtain NMPRC approval for any financing transaction having a maturity of more than 18 months.  In addition, PNM files its annual short-term financing plan with the NMPRC.  PNMR, PNM, and TNMP are subject to debt-to-capital ratio requirements of less than or equal to 65%.  The Company s ability to access the credit and capital markets at a reasonable cost is largely dependent upon its: 
             
    Ability to earn a fair return on equity  
                
    Results of operations  
                
    Ability to obtain required regulatory approvals  
                
    Conditions in the financial markets  
                
    Credit ratings  
       
  On December 17, 2015, TNMP entered into an agreement, which provided that TNMP would issue $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.53% first mortgage bonds, due 2026, on or about February 10, 2016.  TNMP issued the Series 2016A Bonds on February 10, 2016 and used the proceeds to reduce short-term debt and intercompany debt. 
    
  As of February 1, 2016, NM Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of PNMR, entered into a $125.0 million term loan agreement (the  BTMU Term Loan Agreement ), among NM Capital, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. ( BTMU ), as lender, and BTMU, as Administrative Agent.  The BTMU Term Loan Agreement has a maturity date of February 1, 2021 and bears interest at a rate based on LIBOR plus a customary spread, which aggregated 3.51% at September 30, 2016.  The principal balance outstanding under the BTMU Term Loan Agreement was $107.8 million at   September 30, 2016  .  PNMR, as parent company of NM Capital, has guaranteed NM Capital s obligations to BTMU.  NM Capital utilized the proceeds of the BTMU Term Loan Agreement to provide funding for the $125.0 million Westmoreland Loan to a ring-fenced, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose entity, which is a subsidiary of Westmoreland to finance the purchase price of the stock of SJCC.  See (Note 11).  
    
  On May 20, 2016, PNM entered into a $175.0 million term loan agreement (the  PNM 2016 Term Loan Agreement ).  The PNM 2016 Term Loan Agreement bears interest at a variable rate, which was 1.15% at   September 30, 2016  , and has a maturity date of November 17, 2017.  PNM used a portion of the proceeds of the PNM 2016 Term Loan Agreement to prepay without penalty the   $125.0 million   outstanding under the PNM Multi-draw Term Loan, which had a scheduled maturity of June 21, 2016.

On September 27, 2016, PNM participated in the issuance and sale of an aggregate of $146.0 million of PCRBs by the City of Farmington, New Mexico. The proceeds from the sale were utilized to refund an aggregate of $146.0 million of outstanding PCRBs previously issued by the City of Farmington. The arrangements governing the PCRBs result in PNM reflecting the bonds as debt on its financial statements.  The PCRBs issued consist of the 2016 Series A in the aggregate principal amount of $46.0 million and the 2016 Series B in the aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million.  Both series bear interest at a rate of 1.875% for the period from September 27, 2016 through September 30, 2021, have a mandatory tender for remarketing on October 1, 2021, and a final maturity on April 1, 2033. 
    
  On October 21, 2016, PNMR entered into a letter of credit arrangement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under which letters of credit aggregating   $30.3 million   (the  JPM LOCs ) were issued to replace letters of credit issued from available capacity under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility.  The letters of credit issued from available capacity under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility will be surrendered and canceled upon acceptance of the JPM LOCs by the surety companies that issued the reclamation bonds.  The letters of credit facilitate the posting of reclamation bonds, which SJCC is required to post in connection with permits relating to the operation of the San Juan mine (Note 11). 
    
  At September 30, 2016, interest rates on outstanding borrowings were 1.38% for the PNMR Term Loan Agreement and 1.42% for the PNMR 2015 Term Loan Agreement. 
    
  Capital Requirements 
    
  PNMR s total capital requirements consist of construction expenditures and cash dividend requirements for PNMR common stock and PNM preferred stock.  Key activities in PNMR s current construction program include: 

Upgrading generation resources, including expenditures for compliance with environmental requirements 
                
    Expanding the electric transmission and distribution systems 
                
    Purchasing nuclear fuel 
       
  Projected capital requirements, including amounts expended through   September 30, 2016  , are: 

The construction expenditure estimates are under continuing review and subject to ongoing adjustment, as well as to Board review and approval.  The construction expenditures above include environmental upgrades of $0.8 million at SJGS and $84.8 million at Four Corners, 30 MW of new solar capacity to supply power to a new data center being constructed by Facebook Inc. (Note 12), and the January 2016 purchase of the assets underlying three of the PVNGS Unit 2 leases at the expiration of those leases for $163.3 million. Expenditures for environmental upgrades are estimated to be $41.2 million in 2016, including amounts expended through September 30, 2016.  See Note 11 and Commitments and Contractual Obligations below.  The ability of PNMR to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon the ability of PNM and TNMP to be able to pay dividends to PNMR.  Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K describes regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by PNM and TNMP. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , PNMR met its capital requirements and construction expenditures through cash generated from operations, as well as its liquidity arrangements, and the additional borrowings described under Financing Activities above. 
    
  In addition to the capital requirements for construction expenditures and dividends, the Company has long-term debt that must be paid or refinanced at maturity.  As indicated above, the $125.0 million PNM Multi-draw Term Loan was repaid prior to its June 21, 2016 maturity.  Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K contains additional information about the maturities of long-term debt.  In addition, NM Capital is required to make quarterly payments of at least $5.0 million under the BTMU Term Loan Agreement.  However, NM Capital must also utilize all amounts, le 
  
    100 

     Table of Contents  

ss taxes and fees, it receives under the Westmoreland Loan to repay the BTMU Term Loan Agreement.  Based on scheduled payments on the Westmoreland Loan, NM Capital estimates it will make principal payments of $45.1 million on the BTMU Term Loan Agreement in the twelve months ended September 30, 2017.  Also, the one-year $150.0 million PNMR Term Loan Agreement matures on December 21, 2016 and $57.0 million of PCRBs are subject to mandatory tender and remarketing on June 1, 2017.  PNMR and PNM anticipate that funds to repay the long-term debt maturities and term loans will come from entering into new arrangements similar to the existing agreements, borrowing under their revolving credit facilities, issuance of new long-term debt, or a combination of these sources.  The Company has from time to time refinanced or repurchased portions of its outstanding debt before scheduled maturity.  Depending on market conditions, the Company may refinance other debt issuances or make additional debt repurchases in the future.  
  Liquidity 
  PNMR s liquidity arrangements include the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility and the PNM Revolving Credit Facility both of which expire in October 2020 and the TNMP Revolving Credit Facility that expires in September 2018.  The PNMR Revolving Credit Facility has a financing capacity of $300.0 million, the PNM Revolving Credit Facility has a financing capacity of $400.0 million, and the TNMP Revolving Credit Facility has a financing capacity of $75.0 million.  PNM also has the $50.0 million PNM New Mexico Credit Facility, which expires in January 2018.  The Company believes the terms and conditions of these facilities are consistent with those of other investment grade revolving credit facilities in the utility industry.   
  The revolving credit facilities and the PNM New Mexico Credit Facility provide short-term borrowing capacity.  The revolving credit facilities also allow letters of credit to be issued.  Letters of credit reduce the available capacity under the facilities.  The Company utilizes these credit facilities and cash flows from operations to provide funds for both construction and operational expenditures.  The Company s business is seasonal with more revenues and cash flows from operations being generated in the summer months.  In general, the Company relies on the credit facilities to be the initial funding source for construction expenditures.  Accordingly, borrowings under the facilities may increase over time.  Depending on market and other conditions, the Company will periodically sell long-term debt and use the proceeds to reduce the borrowings under the credit facilities.  Borrowings under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility ranged from $79.6 million to $177.5 million during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and from $40.0 million to $177.5 million during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Borrowings under the PNM Revolving Credit Facility ranged from $10.0 million to $131.0 million during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and zero to $135.0 million during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Borrowings under the PNM New Mexico Credit Facility ranged from $15.0 million to $35.0 million during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and zero to $50.0 million during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Borrowings under the TNMP Revolving Credit Facility ranged from zero to $36.0 million during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and zero to $70.0 million during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  At   September 30, 2016  , the average interest rate was   1.78%   for the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility,   1.66%   for the PNM Revolving Credit Facility, and   1.68%   for the PNM New Mexico Credit Facility.  At   September 30, 2016  , TNMP had no borrowings under the TNMP Revolving Credit Facility or from PNMR under its intercompany loan agreement.   
  The Company currently believes that its capital requirements can be met through internal cash generation, existing or new credit arrangements, and access to public and private capital markets.  To cover the difference in the amounts and timing of internal cash generation and cash requirements, the Company intends to use short-term borrowings under its current and future liquidity arrangements.  However, if difficult market conditions experienced during the recent recession return, the Company may not be able to access the capital markets or renew credit facilities when they expire.  Should that occur, the Company would seek to improve cash flows by reducing capital expenditures and exploring other available alternatives.  Also, PNM could consider seeking authorization for the issuance of first mortgage bonds to improve access to the capital markets. 
  In addition to its internal cash generation, the Company anticipates that it will be necessary to obtain additional long-term financing to fund its capital requirements during the 2016-2020 period.  This could include new debt issuances and/or new equity. 
  Information concerning the credit ratings for PNMR, PNM, and TNMP was set forth under the heading Liquidity in the MD A contained in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.  Currently, all of the credit ratings issued by both Moody s and S P on the Company s debt are investment grade.  As of   October 21, 2016  , ratings on the Company s securities were as follows:

  Both S P and Moody s have PNMR, PNM, and TNMP on a stable outlook.  However, the ultimate outcome from PNM s NM 2015 Rate Case, including the pending appeal before the NM Supreme Court, discussed in Note 12, could affect both the outlook and credit ratings.  Investors are cautioned that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, that it is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
    
  A summary of liquidity arrangements as of   October 21, 2016   is as follows:  

The above table includes a $30.3 million of letter of credit support issued under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility to facilitate the posting of reclamation bonds in connection with the purchase of SJCC by a subsidiary of Westmoreland from BHP.  As discussed in Note 11, on October 21, 2016, PNMR entered into separate letter of credit arrangements with a bank under which letters of credit were issued to replace the letters of credit issued under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility.  The letters of credit issued under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility will be surrendered and canceled upon acceptance of the replacement letters of credit by the surety companies that issued the reclamation bonds.  The above table excludes intercompany debt.  As of   October 21, 2016  , PNM and TNMP had   no   intercompany borrowings from PNMR.  The remaining availability under the revolving credit facilities at any point in time varies based on a number of factors, including the timing of collections of accounts receivables and payments for construction and operating expenditures.  
  PNMR can offer new shares of common stock through the PNM Resources Direct Plan under a SEC shelf registration statement that expires in August 2018.  PNM has a shelf registration statement for up to $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes that expires in May 2017.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
  PNMR s off-balance sheet arrangements include PNM s operating leases for portions of PVNGS Units 1 and 2 and, until April 1, 2015, the EIP transmission line.  These arrangements help ensure PNM the availability of lower-cost generation needed to serve customers.  See MD A   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Notes 7 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K, as well as Note 5.   
  Commitments and Contractual Obligations 
  PNMR, PNM, and TNMP have contractual obligations for long-term debt, operating leases, construction expenditures, purchase obligations, and certain other long-term obligations.  See MD A   Commitments and Contractual Obligations in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.    
    
     Contingent Provisions of Certain Obligations  
  As discussed in the 2015 Annual Reports on Form 10-K,     PNMR, PNM, and TNMP have a number of debt obligations and other contractual commitments that contain contingent provisions.  Some of these, if triggered, could affect the liquidity of the Company.  In the unlikely event that the contingent requirements were to be triggered, PNMR, PNM, or TNMP could be required to provide security, immediately pay outstanding obligations, or be prevented from drawing on unused capacity under certain credit agreements.  The contingent provisions also include contractual increases in the interest rate charged on certain of the Company s short-term debt obligations in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings.  The Company believes its financing arrangements are sufficient to meet the requirements of the contingent provisions.  No conditions have occurred that would result in any of the above contingent provisions being implemented.

OTHER ISSUES FACING THE COMPANY 
    
  Climate Change Issues  
    
  Background 
  In 2015, GHG associated with PNM s interests in its generating plants included approximately 6.4 million metric tons of CO   2   , which comprises the vast majority of PNM s GHG.  By comparison, the total GHG in the United States in 2014, the latest year for which EPA has published this data, were approximately 6.9 billion metric tons, of which approximately 5.5 billion metric tons were CO   2   .   
  PNM has several programs underway to reduce or offset GHG from its resource portfolio, thereby reducing its exposure to climate change regulation.  See   Note 12  .  In 2015, PNM completed construction of 40 MW of utility-scale solar generation, bringing its total owned solar generation capacity to 107 MW.  Since 2003, PNM has purchased the entire output of New Mexico Wind, which has an aggregate capacity of 204 MW, and, in January 2015, began purchasing the full output of Red Mesa Wind, which has an aggregate capacity of 102 MW.  PNM has a 20-year PPA for the output of Lightning Dock Geothermal, which began providing power to PNM in January 2014.  The current capacity of the geothermal facility is 4 MW and future expansion may result in up to 9 MW of generation capacity.  Additionally, PNM has a customer distributed solar generation program that represented 57.3 MW at September 30, 2016.  PNM s distributed solar programs will reduce PNM s annual production from fossil-fueled electricity generation by about 136 GWh.  PNM offers its customers a comprehensive portfolio of energy efficiency and load management programs, with a budget of $25.8 million for the program year beginning in June 2016.  PNM estimates these programs saved approximately 79 GWh of electricity in 2015.  Over the next 18 years, PNM projects energy efficiency and load management programs will provide the equivalent of approximately 9,000 GWh of electricity, which will avoid at least 5.5 million metric tons of CO   2    based upon projected emissions from PNM s system-wide resources.  These estimates are subject to change because of the uncertainty of many of the underlying variables, including changes in demand for electricity, and complex relationships between those variables.   
  Management periodically updates the Board on implementation of the corporate environmental policy and the Company s environmental management systems, promotion of energy efficiency, and use of renewable resources.  The Board is also advised of the Company s practices and procedures to assess the sustainability impacts of operations on the environment.  The Board considers associated issues around climate change, the Company s GHG exposures, and the financial consequences that might result from potential federal and/or state regulation of GHG.  
  As of December 31, 2015, approximately 70.6% of PNM s generating capacity, including resources owned, leased, and under PPAs, all of which is located within the United States, consisted of coal or gas-fired generation that produces GHG.  Based on current forecasts, the Company does not expect its output of GHG from existing sources to increase significantly in the near-term.  Many factors affect the amount of GHG emitted.  For example, if new natural gas-fired generation resources are added to meet increased load as anticipated in PNM s current IRP, GHG would be incrementally increased.  In addition, plant performance could impact the amount of GHG emitted.  If PVNGS experienced prolonged outages, PNM might be required to utilize other power supply resources such as gas-fired generation, which could increase GHG.  As described in   Note 11  , PNM received approval for the December 31, 2017 shutdown of SJGS Units 2 and 3 as part of its strategy to address the regional haze requirements of the CAA.  The shutdown of Units 2 and 3 would result in a reduction of GHG for the entire station of approximately 50%, including a reduction of approximately 28% for the Company s ownership interests.  Although replacement power for these units includes some gas-fired generation, the reduction in GHG from the retirement of the coal-fired generation would be far greater than the increase in GHG from replacement generation.  
  Because of PNM s dependence on fossil-fueled generation, legislation or regulation that imposes a limit or cost on GHG could impact the cost at which electricity is produced.  While PNM expects to recover any such costs through rates, the timing and outcome of proceedings for cost recovery are uncertain.  In addition, to the extent that any additional costs are recovered through rates, customers may reduce their usage, relocate facilities to other areas with lower energy costs, or take other actions that ultimately will adversely impact PNM.   
  PNM s generating stations are located in the arid southwest.  Access to water for cooling for some of these facilities is critical to continued operations.  Forecasts for the impacts of climate change on water supply in the southwest range from reduced precipitation to changes in the timing of precipitation.  In either case, PNM s facilities requiring water for cooling will need to mitigate the impacts of climate change through adaptive measures.  Current measures employed by PNM generating stations such as air cooling, use of grey water, improved reservoir operations and shortage sharing arrangements with other water users will continue to be important to sustain operations.

PNM s service areas occasionally experience periodic high winds, forest fires, and severe thunderstorms.  TNMP has operations in the Gulf Coast area of Texas, which experiences periodic hurricanes and drought conditions.  In addition to potentially causing physical damage to Company-owned facilities, which disrupts the ability to transmit and/or distribute energy, weather and other events of nature can temporarily reduce customers  usage and demand for energy.    
  Changes in the climate are generally not expected to have material consequences to the Company in the near-term.  The Company cannot anticipate or predict the potential long-term effects of climate change on its assets and operations.  
    
  EPA Regulation 
  In April 2007, the US Supreme Court held that EPA has the authority to regulate GHG under the CAA.  This decision heightened the importance of this issue for the energy industry.  In December 2009, EPA released its endangerment finding stating that the atmospheric concentrations of six key greenhouse gases (CO   2   , methane, nitrous oxides, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride) endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations.  In May 2010, EPA released the final PSD and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule (the  Tailoring Rule ) to address GHG from stationary sources under the CAA permitting programs.  The purpose of the rule was to  tailor  the applicability of two programs, PSD and Title V operating permit programs, to avoid impacting millions of small GHG emitters.  The rule focused on the largest sources of GHG, including fossil-fueled electric generating units.  This program covered the construction of new emission units that emit GHG of at least 100,000 tons per year in CO   2    equivalents (even if PSD is not triggered for other pollutants).  In addition, modifications at existing major-emitting facilities that increase GHG by at least 75,000 tons per year in CO   2    equivalents would be subject to PSD permitting requirements, even if they did not significantly increase emissions of any other pollutant.  As a result, PNM s fossil-fueled generating plants were more likely to trigger PSD permitting requirements because of the magnitude of GHG.  However, as discussed below, a court case in 2014 now limits the extent of the Tailoring Rule. 
  On June 26, 2012, the DC Circuit rejected challenges to EPA s 2009 GHG endangerment finding, GHG standards for light-duty vehicles, PSD Interpretive Memorandum (EPA s so-called GHG  Timing Rule ), and the Tailoring Rule.  The court found that EPA s endangerment finding and its light-duty vehicle rule  are neither arbitrary nor capricious,  that  EPA s interpretation of the governing CAA provisions is unambiguously correct,  and that  no petitioner has standing to challenge the Timing and Tailoring Rules.   On October 15, 2013, the US Supreme Court granted a petition for a Writ of Certiorari regarding the permitting of stationary sources that emit GHG.  The US Supreme Court limited the question that it would review to:  Whether EPA permissibly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases.   Specifically, the case dealt with whether EPA s determination that regulation of GHG from motor vehicles required EPA to regulate stationary sources under the PSD and Title V permitting programs.  The petitioners argued that EPA s determination was unlawful as it violates Congressional intent. 
    
  On June 23, 2014, the US Supreme Court issued its opinion on the above case.  The US Supreme Court largely reversed the DC Circuit. First, the US Supreme Court found the CAA does not compel or permit EPA to adopt an interpretation of the act that requires a source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit on the sole basis of its potential GHG.  Second, EPA had argued that even if it was not required to regulate GHGs under the PSD and Title V programs, the Tailoring Rule was nonetheless justified on the grounds that it was a reasonable interpretation of the CAA.  The US Supreme Court rejected this argument.  Third, the US Supreme Court found EPA lacked authority to  tailor  the CAA s unambiguous numerical thresholds of 100 or 250 tons per year.  Fourth, the US Supreme Court found that it would be reasonable for EPA to interpret the CAA to limit the PSD program for GHGs to  anyway  sources   those sources that have to comply with the PSD program for other non-GHG pollutants.  The US Supreme Court said that EPA needed to establish a   de minimis   level below which BACT would not be required for  anyway  sources.  In response to the US Supreme Court decision, EPA released a proposed rule on October 3, 2016, to revise the permitting rules for GHG under the CAA.  Among other things, the proposed rule would set the Significant Emissions Rate ( SER ) for GHGs under the major source permitting program at 75,000 tons of CO   2    equivalent per year for new and modified sources that are already subject to NSR based on emission of other pollutants.  If finalized as proposed, the rule would require a new major source or major modification that triggers PSD permitting for other criteria pollutants like NOx to undergo a BACT review for GHG if the potential to emit GHG exceeds the 75,000 tons per year.  EPA also is requesting comments on establishing a GHG SER level at or above 30,000 tons of CO   2    equivalent per year.  Comments on the proposed rule are due on December 2, 2016. 
    
  On June 25, 2013, President Obama announced his Climate Action Plan which outlines how his administration plans to cut GHG in the United States, prepare the country for the impacts of climate change, and lead international efforts to combat and prepare for global warming.  The plan proposes actions that would lead to the reduction of GHG by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The President also issued a Presidential Memorandum to EPA to continue development of the GHG NSPS regulations for electric generators.  The Presidential Memorandum establishes a timeline for the reproposal and issuance of a GHG NSPS for new  
  
    105 

     Table of Contents  

sources under section 111(b) of the CAA and a timeline for the proposal and final rule for developing carbon pollution standards, regulations, or guidelines for GHG reductions from existing sources under Section 111(d) of the CAA.  The Presidential Memorandum further directs EPA to allow the use of  market-based instruments  and  other regulatory flexibilities  to ensure standards will allow for continued reliance on a range of energy sources and technologies, and that the standards are developed and implemented in a manner that provides for reliable and affordable energy.  EPA is to undertake the rulemaking through direct engagement with states,  as they will play a central role in establishing and implementing standards for existing power plants,  and with utility leaders, labor leaders, non-governmental organizations, tribal officials, and other stakeholders. 
    
  EPA met the President s timeline for issuance of carbon pollution standards for new sources under Section 111(b) and for existing sources under Section 111(d) of the CAA.  On August 3, 2015, EPA issued its final standards to limit CO   2    emissions from power plants.  The final rule was published on October 23, 2015.  Three separate but related actions took place: (1) the final Carbon Pollution Standards for new, modified, and reconstructed power plants were established (under Section 111(b)); (2) the final Clean Power Plan was issued to set standards for carbon emission reductions from existing power plants (under Section 111(d)); and (3) a proposed federal plan associated with the final Clean Power Plan was released. 
    
  EPA s final rule to limit GHG emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed power plants establishes standards based upon certain, specific conditions.  For newly constructed and reconstructed base load natural gas-fired stationary combustion turbines, the EPA finalized a standard of 1,000 lb CO   2   /MWh-gross based on efficient natural gas combined cycled technology as the best system of emissions reductions ( BSER ).  Alternatively, owners and operators of base load natural gas-fired combustion turbines may elect to comply with a standard based on an output of 1,030 lb CO   2   /MWh-net.  A new source is any newly constructed fossil fuel-fired power plant that commenced construction after January 8, 2014.   
    
  The final standards for coal-fired power plants vary depending on whether the unit is new, modified, or reconstructed.  The BSER for new steam units is a supercritical pulverized coal unit with partial carbon capture and storage.  Based on that technology, new coal-fired units are required to meet an emissions standard equal to 1,400 lbs CO   2   /MWh from the beginning of the power plant s life.  The BSER for modified units is based on each affected unit s own best potential performance.  Standards will be in the form of an emission limit in pounds of CO   2    per MWh, which will apply to units with modifications resulting in an increase of hourly CO   2    emissions of more than 10% relative to the emissions of the most recent five years from that unit.  The BSER for reconstructed coal-fired power units is the performance of the most efficient generating technology for these types of units.  Final emissions standards depend on heat input.  Sources with heat input greater than 2,000 MMBTU/hour would be required to meet an emission limit of 1,800 lbs CO   2   /MWh-gross, and sources with a heat input of less than or equal to 2,000 MMBTU/hour would be required to meet an emission limit of 2,000 lbs CO   2   /MWh-gross. 
    
  The final Clean Power Plan rule changed significantly in structure from the proposed rule that was released in June 2014.  Changes include delaying the first compliance date by two years from 2020 to 2022; adopting a new approach to calculating the emission targets which resulted in different state goals than those originally proposed; adding a reliability safety valve; and proposing rewards for early reductions.  The rule establishes two numeric  emission standards  - one for  fossil-steam  units (coal- and oil-fired units) and one for natural gas-fired units (combined cycle only).  The emission standards are based on emission reduction opportunities that EPA deemed achievable using technical assumptions for three  building blocks:  efficiency improvements at coal-fired EGUs, displacement of affected EGUs with renewable energy, and displacement of coal-fired generation with natural gas-fired generation.  The final standards are 1,305 lb/MWH for fossil-steam units and 771 lb/MWH for gas units, both of which phase in over the period 2022-2030.  To facilitate implementation, EPA converted the emission standards into state goals.  Each state s goal reflects the average state-wide emission rate that all of the state s affected EGUs would meet in the aggregate if each one achieved the emission standards alone based upon a weighted average of each state s unique mix of affected units.  
    
  Under the final rule, the Clean Power Plan compliance schedule required states to make initial plan submissions to EPA by September 6, 2016.  EPA could then choose to grant up to a two-year extension provided that the initial plan meets certain specified criteria for progress and consultation.  States receiving an extension must submit an update to EPA in 2017 and final plans by September 2018.  States not requesting an extension were to submit their final plans by September 2016.  State plans can be based on either an emission standards (rate or mass) approach or a state measures approach.  Under an emission standards approach, federally enforceable emission limits are placed directly on affected units in the state.  A state measures approach must meet equivalent rates statewide, but may include some elements, such as renewable energy or energy efficiency requirements, that are not federally enforceable.  Plans using state measures may only be used with mass-based goals and must include  backstop  federally enforceable standards for EGUs that will become effective if the state measures fail to achieve the expected level of emission reductions.

The Clean Power Plan also proposes a Clean Energy Incentive Program ( CEIP ) designed to award credits for early development of certain renewable energy and energy efficiency programs that displace fossil generation in 2020 and 2021 prior to the compliance obligation taking effect in 2022.  On June 30, 2016, EPA published proposed design details of the CEIP.  Comments are due to EPA on November 1, 2016.  In addition, the Clean Power Plan contains a reliability safety valve for individual power plants.  The reliability safety valve allows for a 90-day relief from CO   2    emissions limits if generating units need to continue to operate and release excess emissions during emergencies that could compromise electric system reliability. 
    
  As discussed above, EPA issued a proposed Federal Plan in association with the Clean Power Plan.  Under Section 111(d), EPA is authorized to issue a federal plan for states that do not submit an approvable state plan.  EPA indicates that states may voluntarily adopt the Federal Plan in whole or in part as its state plan.  EPA explains in its communications that the proposed Federal Plan will be released in advance of the deadline for submission of state plans to provide regulatory certainty to states that fail to submit an approvable plan.  The proposed Federal Plan will apply emission reduction obligations directly on affected EGUs.  The plan presents two approaches: a rate-based emissions trading program and a mass-based emissions trading program.  EPA indicates that it will choose only one of these approaches in the final Federal Plan.  However, the proposed rule will offer both approaches for states to use as models in their own plans.  EPA asked for comments on the proposed Federal Plan by January 21, 2016.  PNM submitted comments in response.  
    
  Multiple states, utilities, and trade groups filed petitions for review and motions to stay in the DC Circuit.  On January 21, 2016, the DC Circuit denied the motions to stay the EPA s section 111(d) rule (the Clean Power Plan).  It did, however, expedite briefing in the case and set it for oral argument on June 2, 2016.  Under the court s order, the parties were required to submit a proposed briefing format to the court by January 27, 2016.  Briefing on all issues was to be completed by April 22, 2016.  Petitioners had asked for bifurcated briefing that would allow the core legal issues to be litigated first and the programmatic issues related to the rule to be litigated later depending on the outcome of the litigation.  The court denied that request.   
    
  On January 26, 2016, 29 states and state agencies filed a petition to the US Supreme Court asking the court to reverse the DC Circuit s decision and stay the implementation of the Clean Power Plan.  On February 9, 2016, the US Supreme Court granted the applications to stay the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review of the rule.  The US Supreme Court issued a one-page order that stated,  The EPA rule to have states cut power sector carbon dioxide (CO   2   ) emissions 32% by 2030 is stayed pending disposition of the applicants  petitions for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.   The vote was 5-4 among the US Supreme Court Justices. The decision means the Clean Power Plan is not in effect and states are not obliged to comply with its requirements.  If the rule prevails through the legal challenges, states will be able to resume preparing state plans and may still have six more months to prepare initial plans and 2.5 years for final plans (if an extension is granted by EPA).  The DC Circuit heard oral arguments on the merits of the states  case on September 27, 2016.  The arguments were made in front of a 10-judge panel.  There is no mandatory deadline for the DC Circuit to make a decision on the case and a decision is not expected until sometime in 2017.  The stay will remain in effect pending US Supreme Court review if such review is sought. 
    
  If the Clean Power Plan prevails, the rule will impact PNM s existing and future fossil-fueled EGUs.  The existing Carbon Pollution Standards covering new sources will also impact PNM s generation fleet.  Impacts could involve investments in additional renewables and energy efficiency programs, efficiency improvements, and/or control technologies at PNM s fossil-fueled EGUs.  Under an emissions rate or mass based trading program, PNM may be required to purchase credits or allowances to comply with New Mexico s final state plan.  There are limited efficiency enhancement measures that may be available to a subset of the existing EGUs; however, such measures would provide only marginal GHG improvements.  The only emission control technology for GHG reduction from coal and gas-fired power plants is carbon capture and sequestration, which is not yet a commercially demonstrated technology.  Additional GHG control technologies for existing EGUs may become viable in the future.  The costs of purchasing carbon credits or allowances, making improvements, or installing new technology could impact the economic viability of some plants.  PNM estimates that implementation of the BART plan at SJGS that required the installation of SNCRs on Units 1 and 4 by early 2016, which has been completed, and the retirement of SJGS Units 2 and 3 by the end of 2017 as described in   Note 11  , should provide a significant step for New Mexico to meet its ultimate compliance with Section 111(d).  PNM is unable to predict the impact of this rule on its fossil-fueled generation. 
  Federal Legislation 
  Prospects for enactment in Congress of legislation imposing a new or enhanced regulatory program to address climate change are unlikely in 2016.  Instead, EPA is the primary vehicle for GHG regulation in the near future, especially for coal-fired EGUs.  The US Supreme Court s decision to stay the Clean Power Plan does put into question the viability of the rule, but EPA is encouraging states to continue to develop plans for compliance even during the stay.  In addition, while there are legislative proposals to limit or block implementation of the Clean Power Plan, enactment of such legislation appears unlikely.

State and Regional Activity     
  Pursuant to New Mexico law, each utility must submit an IRP to the NMPRC every three years to evaluate renewable energy, energy efficiency, load management, distributed generation, and conventional supply-side resources on a consistent and comparable basis.  The IRP is required to take into consideration risk and uncertainty of fuel supply, price volatility, and costs of anticipated environmental regulations when evaluating resource options to meet supply needs of the utility s customers.  The NMPRC requires that New Mexico utilities factor a standardized cost of carbon emissions into their IRPs using prices ranging between $8 and $40 per metric ton of CO   2    emitted and escalating these costs by 2.5% per year.  Under the NMPRC order, each utility must analyze these standardized prices as projected operating costs.  Reflecting the developing nature of this issue, the NMPRC order states that these prices may be changed in the future to account for additional information or changed circumstances.  Although these prices may not reflect the costs that ultimately will be incurred, PNM is required to use these prices for purposes of its IRP.  PNM s IRP filed with the NMPRC on July 1, 2014 showed that consideration of carbon emissions costs impacted the projected in-service dates of some of the identified resources.  PNM has begun its process for the 2017 IRP that is to be filed by July 1, 2017. 
  In the past, New Mexico adopted regulations that would directly limit GHG from larger sources, including EGUs, through a regional GHG cap and trade program.  Although these rules have been repealed, PNM cannot rule out future state legislative or regulatory initiatives to regulate GHG.      
  On August 2, 2012, thirty-three New Mexico organizations representing public health, business, environmental, consumers, Native American, and other interested parties filed a petition for rulemaking with the NMPRC.  The petition asked the NMPRC to issue a NOPR regarding the implementation of an Optional Clean Energy Standard for electric utilities located in New Mexico.  The proposed standard would have utilities that elect to participate reduce their CO   2    emissions by 3% per year.  Utilities that opt into the program would be assured recovery of their reasonable compliance costs.  On October 4, 2012, the NMPRC held a workshop to discuss the proposed standard and whether it has authority to proceed with the NOPR.  On August 28, 2013, the petitioners amended the August 2, 2012 petition and requested that the NMPRC issue a NOPR to implement a  Carbon Risk Reduction Rule  for electric utilities in New Mexico.  The proposed rule would require affected utilities to demonstrate a 3% per year CO   2    emission reduction from a three-year average baseline period between 2005 and 2012.  The proposed rule would use a credit system that provides credits for electricity production based on how much less than one metric ton of CO   2    per MWh the utility emits.  Credits would be retired such that 3% per year reductions are achieved from the baseline year until 2035 unless a participating utility elects to terminate the program at the end of 2023.  Credits would not expire and could be banked.  An advisory committee of interested stakeholders would monitor the program.  In addition, utilities would be allowed to satisfy their obligations by funding NMPRC approved energy efficiency programs.  There has been no further action on this matter at the NMPRC. 
    
  International Accords 
    
  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) is an international environmental treaty that was negotiated at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (informally known as the Earth Summit) and entered into force in March 1994.  The objective of the treaty is to  stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.   Parties to the UNFCCC, including the United States, have been meeting annually in Conferences of the Parties ( COP ) to assess progress in meeting the objectives of the UNFCCC.  This assessment process led to the negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol in the mid-1990s.  The Protocol, which was agreed to in 1997 and established legally binding obligations for developed countries to reduce their GHG, was never ratified by the United States.  PNM monitors the proceedings of the UNFCCC, including the annual COP meetings, to determine potential impacts to its business activities.  At the COP meeting in 2011, participating nations, including the United States, agreed to negotiate by 2015 an international agreement involving commitments by all nations to begin reducing carbon emissions by 2020.  On December 12, 2015, the Paris Agreement was finalized during the 2015 COP.  The agreement, which was agreed to by more than 190 nations, requires that countries submit Nationally Determined Contributions ( NDCs ). NDCs reflect national targets and actions that arise out of national policies, and elements relating to oversight, guidance and coordination of actions to reduce emissions by all countries.  In November 2014, President Obama announced the United States  commitment to reduce GHG, on an economy-wide basis, by 26%-28% from 2005 levels by the year 2025.  The United States NDC is part of an overall effort by the Obama Administration to have the United States achieve economy-wide reductions of around 80% by 2050.  As part of the process for developing the new global climate agreement, the United States set forth this reduction commitment in its intended NDC.  As part of the Paris Agreement, initial NDCs have been submitted by 189 nations, including the United States and the European Union.  The Paris Agreement will enter into force when at least 55 countries, representing at least 55 percent of total global GHG, have ratified or acceded to it.  To date, the Paris Agreement has been ratified by 75 countries representing more than 58% of global GHG and, as a result, will enter into force on November 4, 2016.  PNM will continue to monitor the United States  participation in international accords.  The Obama administration s GHG reduction target for the electric utility industry is a key

element of its NDC and is based on EPA s final GHG regulations for new, existing, and modified and reconstructed sources.  With the stay of the Clean Power Plan that covers existing sources, it is uncertain how the Obama administration plans to meet its NDC under the Paris Agreement.  PNM believes that implementation of the BART plan for SJGS (  Note 11  ) should provide a significant step towards compliance with the Clean Power Plan, should it prevail, or other GHG reduction requirements. 
    
  Assessment of Legislative/Regulatory Impacts 
    
  The Company has assessed, and continues to assess, the impacts of climate change legislation or regulation on its business.  This assessment is ongoing and future changes arising out of the legislative or regulatory process could impact the assessment significantly.  PNM s assessment includes assumptions regarding specific GHG limits; the timing of implementation of these limits; the possibility of a market-based trading program, including the associated costs and the availability of emission credits or allowances; the development of emission reduction and/or renewable energy technologies; and provisions for cost containment.  Moreover, the assessment assumes various market reactions such as the price of coal and gas and regional plant economics.  These assumptions are, at best, preliminary and speculative.  However, based upon these assumptions, the enactment of climate change legislation or regulation could, among other things, result in significant compliance costs, including large capital expenditures by PNM, and could jeopardize the economic viability of certain generating facilities.  See   Note 11  .  In turn, these consequences could lead to increased costs to customers and affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if the incurred costs are not fully recovered through regulated rates.  Higher rates could also contribute to reduced usage of electricity.  PNM s assessment process is too preliminary and speculative at this time for a meaningful prediction of financial impact. 
    
  Transmission Issues  
   At any given time, FERC has various notices of inquiry and rulemaking dockets related to transmission issues pending.  Such actions may lead to changes in FERC administrative rules or ratemaking policy, but have no time frame in which action must be taken or a docket closed with no further action.  Further, such notices and rulemaking dockets do not apply strictly to PNM, but will have industry-wide effects in that they will apply to all FERC-regulated entities.  PNM monitors and often submits comments taking a position in such notices and rulemaking dockets or may join in larger group responses.  PNM often cannot determine the full impact of a proposed rule and policy change until the final determination is made by FERC and PNM is unable to predict the outcome of these matters. 
  On November 24, 2009, FERC issued Order 729 approving two Modeling, Data, and Analysis Reliability Standards ( Reliability Standards ) submitted by NERC   MOD-001-1 (Available Transmission System Capability) and MOD-029-1 (Rated System Path Methodology).  Both MOD-001-1 and MOD-029-1 require a consistent approach, provided for in the Reliability Standards, to measuring the total transmission capability ( TTC ) of a transmission path.  The TTC level established using the two Reliability Standards could result in a reduction in the available transmission capacity currently used by PNM to deliver generation resources necessary for its jurisdictional load and for fulfilling its obligations to third-party users of the PNM transmission system.    
  During the first quarter of 2011, at the request of PNM and other southwestern utilities, NERC advised all transmission owners and transmission service providers that the implementation of portions of the MOD-029 methodology for  Flow Limited  paths has been delayed until such time as a modification to the standard can be developed that will mitigate the technical concerns identified by the transmission owners and transmission service providers.  PNM and other western utilities filed a Standards Action Request with NERC in the second quarter of 2012. 
  NERC initiated an informal development process to address directives in Order 729 to modify certain aspects of the MOD standards, including MOD-001 and MOD-029.  The modifications to this standard would retire MOD-029 and require each transmission operator to determine and develop methodology for TTC values for MOD-001.   
  A final ballot for MOD-001-2 concluded on December 20, 2013 and received sufficient affirmative votes for approval.  On February 10, 2014, NERC filed with FERC a petition for approval of MOD-001-2 and retirement of reliability standards MOD-001-1a, MOD-004-1, MOD-008-1, MOD-028-2, MOD-029-1a, and MOD-030-2.  On June 19, 2014, FERC issued a NOPR to approve a new reliability standard.  The MOD-001-2 standard will become effective on the first day of the calendar quarter that is 18 months after the date the standard is approved by FERC.  MOD-001-2 will replace multiple existing reliability standards and will remove the risk of reduced TTC for PNM and other western utilities.

Financial Reform Legislation 
    
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( Dodd-Frank Reform Act ), enacted in July 2010, includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading facility.  It also includes provisions related to swap transaction reporting and record keeping and may impose margin requirements on swaps that are not centrally cleared.  The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) has published final rules defining several key terms related to the act and has set compliance dates for various types of market participants.  The Dodd-Frank Reform Act provides exemptions from certain requirements, including an exception to the mandatory clearing and swap facility execution requirements for commercial end-users that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk.  PNM has elected the end-user exception to the mandatory clearing requirement.  PNM expects to be in compliance with the Dodd-Frank Reform Act and related rules within the time frames required by the CFTC.  However, as a result of implementing and complying with the Dodd-Frank Reform Act and related rules, PNM s swap activities could be subject to increased costs, including from higher margin requirements.  At this time, PNM cannot predict the ultimate impact the Dodd-Frank Reform Act may have on PNM s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or liquidity. 
    
  Other Matters 
    
  See   Notes 11 and 12   herein and Notes 16 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the   2015   Annual Reports on Form 10-K for a discussion of commitments and contingencies and rate and regulatory matters.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires Company management to select and apply accounting policies that best provide the framework to report the results of operations and financial position for PNMR, PNM, and TNMP.  The selection and application of those policies requires management to make difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments concerning reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.  As a result, there exists the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no significant changes with regard to the critical accounting policies disclosed in PNMR s, PNM s, and TNMP s   2015   Annual Reports on Forms 10-K.  The policies disclosed included unbilled revenues, regulatory accounting, impairments, decommissioning and reclamation costs, pension and other postretirement benefits, accounting for contingencies, income taxes, and market risk.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
    
  The Company manages the scope of its various forms of market risk through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures with oversight by senior level management through the RMC.  The Board s Finance Committee sets the risk limit parameters.  The RMC has oversight over the risk control organization.  The RMC is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures, and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions on an enterprise-wide basis.  The RMC s responsibilities include: 

Establishing policies regarding risk exposure levels and activities in each of the business segments 
                 
    Approving the types of derivatives entered into for hedging 
                
    Reviewing and approving hedging risk activities 
                
    Establishing policies regarding counterparty exposure and limits 
                 
    Authorizing and delegating transaction limits 
                 
    Reviewing and approving controls and procedures for derivative activities 
                 
    Reviewing and approving models and assumptions used to calculate mark-to-market and market risk exposure 
                 
    Proposing risk limits to the Board s Finance Committee for its approval

To the extent an open position exists, fluctuating commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices, and economic conditions can impact financial results and financial position, either favorably or unfavorably.  As a result, the Company cannot predict with certainty the impact that its risk management decisions may have on its businesses, operating results, or financial position. 
  Commodity Risk 
  Information concerning accounting for derivatives and the risks associated with commodity contracts is set forth in   Note 7  , including a summary of the fair values of mark-to-market energy related derivative contracts included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had no commodity derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedging instruments. 
  Commodity contracts, other than those that do not meet the definition of a derivative under GAAP and those derivatives designated as normal purchases and normal sales, are recorded at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The following table details the changes in the net asset or liability balance sheet position for mark-to-market energy transactions. 

The following table provides the maturity of the net assets (liabilities), giving an indication of when these mark-to-market amounts will settle and generate (use) cash.   
    
  Fair Value of Mark-to-Market Instruments at   September 30, 2016    

PNM measures the market risk of its long-term contracts and wholesale activities using a Monte Carlo VaR simulation model to report the possible loss in value from price movements.  VaR is not a measure of the potential accounting mark-to-market loss.  The quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model.  The Monte Carlo VaR methodology employs the following critical parameters: historical volatility estimates, market values of all contractual commitments, a three-day holding period, seasonally adjusted and cross-commodity correlation estimates, and a 95% confidence level.  The instruments being evaluated may trigger a potential loss in excess of calculated amounts if changes in commodity prices exceed the confidence level of the model used.   
  PNM measures VaR for the positions in its wholesale portfolio (not covered by the FPPAC).  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the high, low, and average VaR amounts were $1.3 million, $0.3 million, and $0.6 million.  For the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the high, low, and average VaR amounts were $2.6 million, $0.5 million, and $1.4 million.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the VaR amounts for the PNM wholesale portfolio were $0.3 million and $1.2 million. 
  
    113 

     Table of Contents  

The VaR represents an estimate of the potential gains or losses that could be recognized on the Company s portfolios, subject to market risk, given current volatility in the market, and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated.  Actual gains and losses may differ due to actual fluctuations in market prices, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, as well as changes to the underlying portfolios during the year.  VaR limits were not exceeded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Credit Risk  
    
  The Company is exposed to credit risk from its retail and wholesale customers, as well as the counterparties to derivative instruments.  The Company conducts counterparty risk analysis across business segments and uses a credit management process to assess the financial conditions of counterparties.  The following table provides information related to credit exposure by the credit worthiness (credit rating) and concentration of credit risk for counterparties to derivative transactions all of which will mature in less than two years.  
  Schedule of Credit Risk Exposure 
  September 30, 2016 

(1)   
    The rating  Investment Grade  is for counterparties, or a guarantor, with a minimum S P rating of BBB- or Moody s rating of Baa3.  The category  Internal Ratings   Investment Grade  includes those counterparties that are internally rated as investment grade in accordance with the guidelines established in the Company s credit policy. 
       
            (2)   
    The Credit Risk Exposure is the gross credit exposure, including long-term contracts (other than firm-requirements wholesale customers), forward sales, and short-term sales.  The exposure captures the amounts from receivables/payables for realized transactions, delivered and unbilled revenues, and mark-to-market gains/losses.  Gross exposures can be offset according to legally enforceable netting arrangements, but are not reduced by posted credit collateral.  At   September 30, 2016  , PNMR held $0.1 million of cash collateral to offset its credit exposure. 
          
  Net credit risk for the Company s largest counterparty as of   September 30, 2016   was $5.7 million. 
    
  As discussed in   Note 11  , PNMR s subsidiary, NM Capital, entered into the Westmoreland Loan and PNMR has arranged for letters of credit to be issued under the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility to support the acquisition of SJCC by WSJ, a subsidiary of Westmoreland.  PNMR is exposed to credit risk under these arrangements in the event of default by WSJ.  As of October 21, 2016, remaining required principal payments under the Westmoreland Loan are $15.0 million in 2016, $38.4 million in 2017, $3.6 million in 2018, $8.6 million in 2019, $23.3 million in 2020, and $21.1 million in 2021.  As of October 21, 2016,   $17.3 million   was held in a restricted bank account that will be used solely to make the November 1, 2016 scheduled principal payment of $15.0 million and interest on the Westmoreland Loan.  In addition, the Westmoreland Loan requires that all cash flows of WSJ, in excess of normal operating expenses, capital additions, and operating reserves, be utilized for principal and interest payments under the loan until it is fully repaid.  The Westmoreland Loan is secured by the assets of and the equity interests in SJCC.  In the event of a default by WSJ, NM Capital would have the ability to take over the mining operations, the value of which PNMR believes approximates the amount outstanding under the Westmoreland Loan.  Furthermore, PNMR considers the possibility of loss under the letter of credit to be remote as discussed in   Note 5  .  Accordingly, PNMR does consider its credit risk under these arrangements to be material.

Interest Rate Risk  
    
  The majority of the Company s long-term debt is fixed-rate debt and does not expose earnings to a major risk of loss due to adverse changes in market interest rates.  However, the fair value of PNMR s consolidated long-term debt instruments would increase by 1.9%, or $47.6 million, if interest rates were to decline by 50 basis points from their levels at   September 30, 2016  .  In general, an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows to the extent not recoverable in rates if all or a portion of debt instruments were acquired in the open market prior to their maturity.  At   October 21, 2016  , PNMR, PNM, and TNMP had short-term debt outstanding of $163.1 million, $24.0 million, and none under their revolving credit facilities, which allow for a maximum aggregate borrowing capacity of $300.0 million for PNMR, $400.0 million for PNM, and $75.0 million for TNMP.  PNM also had borrowings of $6.0 million under the $50.0 million PNM New Mexico Credit Facility at   October 21, 2016  .  The revolving credit facilities, the PNM New Mexico Credit Facility, the $175.0 million PNM 2016 Term Loan Agreement, the $150.0 million PNMR Term Loan Agreement, the $150.0 million PNMR 2015 Term Loan Agreement, and the $125.0 million BTMU Term Loan Agreement bear interest at variable rates.  On   October 21, 2016  , interest rates on borrowings averaged 1.78% for the PNMR Revolving Credit Facility, 1.43% for the PNMR 2015 Term Loan Agreement, 1.38% for the PNMR Term Loan Agreement, 3.51% for the BTMU Term Loan Agreement, 1.15% for the PNM 2016 Term Loan Agreement, 1.66% for the PNM Revolving Credit Facility, and 1.66% for the PNM New Mexico Credit Facility.  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent of future increases in variable interest rates. 
    
  The investments held by PNM in trusts for decommissioning and reclamation had an estimated fair value of $271.0 million at   September 30, 2016  , of which 46.6% were fixed-rate debt securities that subject PNM to risk of loss of fair value with movements in market interest rates.  If interest rates were to increase by 50 basis points from their levels at   September 30, 2016  , the decrease in the fair value of the fixed-rate securities would be 3.5%, or $4.4 million.     
    
  PNM does not directly recover or return through rates any losses or gains on the securities, including equity investments discussed below, in the trusts for decommissioning and reclamation.  However, the overall performance of these trusts does enter into the periodic determinations of expense and funding levels, which are factored into the rate making process to the extent applicable to regulated operations.  However, as described in Note   12  , the NMPRC has ruled that PNM would not be able to include future contributions made by PNM for decommissioning of PVNGS, to the extent applicable to capacity previously leased by PNM, in rates charged to retail customers.  PNM has appealed the NMPRC s ruling to the NM Supreme Court.  PNM is at risk for shortfalls in funding of obligations due to investment losses, including those from the equity market risks discussed below and any negative impact resulting from the United Kingdom s decision to exit the European Union to the extent not ultimately recovered through rates charged to customers.  
    
  Equity Market Risk  
    
  The investments held by PNM in trusts for decommissioning and reclamation include certain equity securities at   September 30, 2016  .  These equity securities expose PNM to losses in fair value should the market values of the underlying securities decline.  Equity securities comprised 51.6% of the securities held by the trusts as of   September 30, 2016  .  A hypothetical 10% decrease in equity prices would reduce the fair values of these funds by $14.0 million. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, each of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of each of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  
    
  Changes in internal controls 
    
  There have been no changes in each of PNMR s, PNM s, and TNMP s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, each of PNMR s, PNM s, and TNMP s internal control over financial reporting.

              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (each registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
