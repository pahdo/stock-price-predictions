    Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   
  (Unaudited)      Note 1.   Basis of Presentation
    The condensed consolidated financial statements include Mondel z International, Inc. as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries.  
 Our interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been omitted. It is management s opinion that these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments
necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and operating results. Net revenues and net earnings for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results.  
 We derived the condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2015 from audited financial statements but do not include all disclosures required by
U.S. GAAP. You should read these statements in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in our Annual Report on Form  10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
  Principles of Consolidation:     As of the close of the fourth quarter of 2015,
we deconsolidated our Venezuelan operations from our consolidated financial statements. As such, the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016. The operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. See  Currency Translation and Highly
Inflationary Accounting: Venezuela  below for more information.    On July 2, 2015, we contributed our global coffee businesses to a new company, Jacobs Douwe
Egberts ( JDE ), in which we now hold an equity interest (collectively, the  JDE coffee business transactions ). Historically, our coffee businesses and the income from equity method investments were recorded within our operating
income as these businesses were part of our base business. While we retain an ongoing interest in coffee through equity method investments including JDE, Keurig Green Mountain Inc. ( Keurig ) and Dongsuh Foods Corporation
( DSF ), and we have significant influence with our equity method investments, we do not control these operations directly. As such, in the third quarter of 2015, we began to recognize equity method investment earnings, consisting
primarily of investments in coffee businesses, outside of operating income and segment income. For periods prior to the third quarter of 2015, our historical coffee business and equity method investment earnings were included within our operating
income and segment income. Please see Note 2,  Divestitures and Acquisitions   JDE Coffee Business Transactions  and  Keurig Transaction , and Note 15,  Segment Reporting , for more information on these transactions.  
  Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting :       We
translate the results of operations of our subsidiaries from multiple currencies using average exchange rates during each period and translate balance sheet accounts using exchange rates at the end of each period. We record currency translation
adjustments as a component of equity (except for highly inflationary currencies) and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings.     United
Kingdom.  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) voted by referendum to exit the European Union ( E.U.  this vote is commonly referred to as  Brexit.  The referendum is non-binding and the exit from the
E.U. is not immediate. Once the U.K. invokes E.U. Article 50, there is a two-year window in which the U.K. and European Commission can negotiate the future terms for imports, exports, taxes, employment, immigration and other areas.  
 Brexit has caused volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, affecting the markets in which we operate. The implications of Brexit could adversely
affect demand for our products, our financial results and operations, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the short or long-term. On June 24, 2016, the value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar
fell by 9%. Since that date, the value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar declined an additional 5% through September 30, 2016. Further volatility in the exchange rate is expected over the transition period.

  As the business operating environment remains uncertain, we continue to monitor our investments and currency exposures
abroad. As the U.K. is not a highly-inflationary economy, we record currency translation adjustments within equity and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings. While we did not experience significant business disruptions in
our U.K. businesses immediately following the referendum, the devaluation of the British pound sterling in late June adversely affected our translated results reported in U.S. dollars. We have a natural hedge in the form of pound
sterling-denominated debt that acts as a net investment hedge, moving counter to adverse pound sterling currency translation impacts. British pound sterling currency transaction risks are largely mitigated due to our global chocolate businesses
buying cocoa in British pound sterling. Our U.K. operations contributed $505 million, or 7.9% of consolidated net revenues in the three months and $1.6 billion, or 8.4% of consolidated net revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
    Venezuela.  From January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015, we accounted for the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the U.S. dollar as
the functional currency as prescribed by U.S. GAAP for highly inflationary economies.    Effective as of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we concluded that we no
longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries due to a loss of control over our Venezuelan operations and an other-than-temporary lack of currency exchangeability. During the fourth quarter of 2015,
representatives of the Venezuelan government arbitrarily imposed pricing restrictions on our local operations that resulted in our inability to recover operating costs. We immediately began an appeal process with the Venezuelan authorities to
demonstrate that our pricing was in line with the regulatory requirements. In January 2016, local officials communicated that some of the pricing restrictions had been lifted; however, the legally required administrative order had not been issued
and it was uncertain when it would be issued. The legal and regulatory environment also became more unreliable. While we had been complying with the Venezuelan law governing pricing and profitability controls and followed the legal process for
appeal, the appeal process was not available to us as outlined under law. Additionally, we were increasingly facing issues procuring raw materials and packaging. Taken together, these actions, the economic environment in Venezuela and the
progressively limited access to dollars to import goods through the use of any of the available currency mechanisms impaired our ability to operate and control our Venezuelan businesses. As a result of these factors, we concluded that we no longer
met the criteria for the consolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries.    As of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of
accounting for our Venezuelan operations. We recorded a $778 million pre-tax loss on December 31, 2015 as we reduced the value of our cost method investment in Venezuela and all Venezuelan receivables held by our other subsidiaries to
realizable fair value, resulting in full impairment. The recorded loss also included historical cumulative translation adjustments related to our Venezuelan operations that had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses
within equity. The fair value of our investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries was estimated based on discounted cash flow projections of current and expected operating losses in the foreseeable future and our ability to operate the business on a
sustainable basis. Our fair value estimate included U.S. dollar exchange and discount rate assumptions that reflect the inflation and economic uncertainty in Venezuela.  
 Beginning in 2016, we no longer include net revenues, earnings or net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries within our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Under the cost method of accounting, earnings are only recognized to the extent cash is received. Given the current and ongoing difficult economic, regulatory and business environment in Venezuela, there continues to be significant uncertainty
related to our operations in Venezuela, and we expect these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. We will monitor the extent of our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and the liquidity and availability of U.S. dollars at
different rates, including the changes to the currency exchange systems in March 2016, as our current situation in Venezuela may change over time and lead to consolidation at a future date.  
 We recorded no revenues, earnings or other financial results from our Venezuelan subsidiaries during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and we
continue to monitor the business, economic and regulatory climate in Venezuela. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the operating results of our Venezuelan operations were included in our condensed consolidated statements of
earnings. During the first quarter of 2015, we recognized an $11 million currency-related remeasurement loss resulting from a devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar exchange rate we historically used to source U.S. dollars for purchases of imported
raw materials, packaging and other goods and services.

  The following table sets forth net revenues and operating income (including the impact of remeasurement losses) for our
Venezuelan operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015:      
    Argentina.  On December 16, 2015, the new Argentinean government fiscal authority announced the lifting of strict currency
controls and reduced restrictions on exports and imports. The next day, the value of the Argentinean peso relative to the U.S. dollar fell by 36%. In the first nine months of 2016, the value of the Argentinean peso relative to the U.S. dollar
declined 18%. Further volatility in the exchange rate is expected. While the business operating environment remains challenging, we continue to monitor and actively manage our investment and exposures in Argentina. We continue executing our hedging
programs and refining our product portfolio to improve our product offerings, mix and profitability. We also continue to implement additional cost initiatives to protect the business. While further currency declines could have an adverse impact on
our ongoing results of operations, we believe the actions by the new government to reduce economic controls and business restrictions will provide favorable opportunities for our Argentinean subsidiaries. Our Argentinean operations contributed $145
million, or 2.3% of consolidated net revenues in the three months and $439 million, or 2.3% of consolidated net revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the net monetary liabilities of our Argentina
operations were not material. Argentina is not designated as a highly-inflationary economy for accounting purposes, so we record currency translation adjustments within equity and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings.  
  Other Countries.  Since we have operations in over 80 countries and sell in 165 countries, we regularly monitor economic and currency-related risks and seek to
take protective measures in response to these exposures. Some of the countries in which we do business have recently experienced periods of significant economic uncertainty. These include Brazil, China, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Nigeria and
Ukraine, most of which have had either currency devaluation or volatility in exchange rates. We continue to monitor operations, currencies and net monetary exposures in these countries. At this time, we do not anticipate any risk to our operating
results from changing to highly inflationary accounting in these countries.     Transfers of Financial Assets:   
 We account for transfers of financial assets, such as uncommitted revolving non-recourse accounts receivable factoring arrangements, when we have surrendered control
over the related assets. Determining whether control has transferred requires an evaluation of relevant legal considerations, an assessment of the nature and extent of our continuing involvement with the assets transferred and any other relevant
considerations. We use receivable factoring arrangements periodically when circumstances are favorable to manage liquidity. We have a factoring arrangement with a major global bank for a maximum combined capacity of $820 million. Under the program,
we may sell eligible short-term trade receivables to the bank in exchange for cash. We then continue to collect the receivables sold, acting solely as a collecting agent on behalf of the bank. We also enter into arrangements with customers to
achieve earlier collection of receivables. The incremental cost of factoring receivables for all regions was $2 million in the three months and $6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1 million in the three months and $4
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and was recorded in net revenue. The outstanding principal amount of receivables under these arrangements amounted to $589 million as of September 30, 2016 and $401 million as of
September 30, 2015.     Accounting Calendar Change:     In connection with
moving toward a common consolidation date across the Company, in the first quarter of 2015, we changed the consolidation date for our North America segment from the last Saturday of each period to the last calendar day of each period. The change had
a favorable impact of $19 million on net revenues and $9 million on operating income in the three months and $57 million on net revenues and $27 million on operating income in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. As a result of this
change, each of our operating subsidiaries now reports results as of the last calendar day of the period.

   New Accounting Pronouncements:   
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) to provide guidance on eight specific
cash flow classification issues and reduce diversity in practice in how some cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,
with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to
simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation. The ASU addresses several areas of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and cash flow
statement presentation. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. We anticipate the impact
of adopting the standard on January 1, 2017 will be greater volatility in our condensed consolidated income statement in subsequent reporting periods. We will begin recording certain stock-based compensation tax impacts in our provision for
income taxes prospectively which, under current guidance, are recorded directly to equity.    In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that simplifies the transition
accounting for increases in investments that require a change from the cost basis to the equity method of accounting. U.S. GAAP currently requires the impact of such changes in accounting method to be retroactively applied to all prior periods that
the investment was held. Under the new standard, adjustments to the investor s basis in the investment should be recorded on the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The equity method of accounting is then applied
prospectively from that date. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. This ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. We
plan to adopt when the ASU becomes effective or earlier if an in-scope transaction arises.    In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that clarifies whether contingent
put and call options meet the  clearly and closely related  criteria in connection with accounting for embedded derivatives. U.S GAAP requires that embedded derivatives be separated from the host contract and accounted for separately as
derivatives if certain criteria are met. The criteria include determining that the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives are not  clearly and closely related  to those of the host contract. The ASU is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the new standard as of December 31, 2016 and do not expect this ASU to have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial
statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that applies when there is a contract novation to a new counterparty for a derivative designated as an accounting
hedge. The ASU clarifies that such a change in counterparty does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of the hedging relationship, provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The ASU is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the new standard as of December 31, 2016 and do not expect this ASU to have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU on lease accounting. The ASU revises existing U.S. GAAP and outlines a new model for lessors and lessees to use in accounting
for lease contracts. The guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. In the condensed consolidated statement of earnings, lessees
will classify leases as either operating (resulting in straight-line expense) or financing (resulting in a front-loaded expense pattern). The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We
are currently assessing the impact across our operations and on our condensed consolidated financial statements.    In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that
provides updated guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. The standard requires that equity investments (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those
that result in consolidation of the investee) be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The standard also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure
requirements for financial instruments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. This ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

  In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU on revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The new ASU outlines a new,
single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control over promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the
consideration the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from customer contracts,
including significant judgments made in recognizing revenue. In 2016, the FASB issued several ASUs that clarified principal versus agent (gross versus net) revenue presentation considerations, confirmed certain prepaid stored-value products should
be accounted for under the new revenue recognition ASU and not under other U.S. GAAP and clarified the guidance for identifying performance obligations within a contract and the accounting for licenses. The FASB also issued an ASU providing narrow
scope exceptions and practical expedients to clarify and improve the implementation of the new revenue recognition guidance. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date which was for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016. The ASU may be applied retrospectively to historical periods presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We continue to make progress on our efforts to assess the impact of the ASU across our
operations and on our condensed consolidated financial statements. We anticipate adopting the new standard on January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective basis.  
  Note 2.   Divestitures and Acquisitions      JDE Coffee Business
Transactions:     On July 2, 2015, we completed transactions to combine our wholly owned coffee businesses with those of D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V.
( DEMB ) to create a new company, JDE. Following the exchange of a portion of our investment in JDE for an interest in Keurig in March 2016, we held a 26.5% equity interest in JDE. The remaining 73.5% equity interest in JDE was held by a
subsidiary of Acorn Holdings B.V. ( AHBV,  owner of DEMB prior to July 2, 2015). Please see discussion of the acquisition of an interest in Keurig below under  Keurig Transaction . As of September 30, 2016, we hold a 26.4%
equity interest in JDE following the transactions discussed under  JDE Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements  below.    The consideration we received in the JDE
coffee business transactions completed on July 2, 2015 consisted of    3.8 billion of cash ($4.2 billion as of July 2, 2015), a 43.5% equity interest in JDE (prior to the decrease in
ownership due to the Keurig transaction and the compensation arrangements discussed below )  and $794 million in receivables (related to sales price adjustments and tax formation cost payments). During the third quarter of 2015, we also
recorded $283 million of cash and receivables from JDE related to reimbursement of costs that we incurred in separating our coffee businesses. The cash and equity consideration we received at closing reflects that we retained our interest in a
Korea-based joint venture, DSF. During the second quarter of 2015, we also completed the sale of our interest in a Japanese coffee joint venture, Ajinomoto General Foods, Inc. ( AGF ). In lieu of contributing our interest in the AGF joint
venture to JDE, we contributed the net cash proceeds from this sale as part of the overall JDE coffee business transactions. Please see discussion of the divestiture of AGF below under  Other Divestitures and Acquisitions .  
 On July 5, 2016, we received an expected cash payment of $275 million from JDE to settle the receivable related to tax formation costs that were part of the
initial sales price.    In connection with the contribution of our global coffee businesses to JDE on July 2, 2015, we recorded a final pre-tax gain of $6.8
billion (or $6.6 billion after taxes) in 2015 after final adjustments as described below. We also recorded approximately $1.0 billion of pre-tax net gains related to hedging the expected cash proceeds from the transactions as described further
below. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we and JDE concluded negotiations of a sales price adjustment and completed the valuation of our investment in JDE. Primarily due to the negotiated resolution of the sales price adjustment in the fourth
quarter of 2015, we recorded a $313 million reduction in the pre-tax gain on the coffee transaction, reducing the $7.1 billion estimated gain in the third quarter of 2015 to the $6.8 billion final gain for 2015. As part of our sales price
negotiations, we retained the right to collect future cash payments if certain estimated pension liabilities are realized over an agreed amount in the future. As such, we may recognize additional income related to this negotiated term in the future.
   The final value of our investment in JDE on July 2, 2015 was    4.1 billion ($4.5 billion as of
July 2, 2015). The fair value of the JDE investment was determined using both income-based and market-based valuation techniques. The discounted cash flow analysis reflected growth, discount and tax rates and other assumptions reflecting the
underlying combined businesses and countries in which the combined coffee businesses operate. The fair value of the JDE investment also included the fair values of the  Carte Noire  and  Merrild  businesses, which JDE agreed to divest to
comply with the conditioned approval by the European Commission related to the JDE coffee business transactions. As of the end of the first quarter of 2016, these businesses were sold by JDE. As the July 2, 2015 fair values for these businesses
were recorded by JDE at their pending sales values, we did not record any gain or loss on the sales of these businesses in our share of JDE s earnings.

  In connection with the expected receipt of cash in euros at the time of closing, we entered into a number of consecutive
currency exchange forward contracts in 2014 and 2015 to lock in an equivalent expected value in U.S. dollars as of the date the JDE coffee business transactions were first announced in May 2014. Cumulatively, we realized aggregate net gains and
received cash of approximately $1.0 billion on these hedging contracts that increased the cash we received in connection with the JDE coffee business transactions from $4.2 billion in cash consideration received to $5.2 billion. In connection with
these currency contracts, we recognized net gains of $29 million in the three months and $436 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 within interest and other expense, net.  
 We also incurred incremental expenses related to readying our global coffee businesses for the transactions that totaled $54 million in the three months and $239
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These expenses were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses of primarily our Europe segment, as well as within our Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa
( EEMEA ) segment and general corporate expenses.     JDE Capital Increase:   
 On December 18, 2015, AHBV and we agreed to provide JDE additional capital to pay down some of its debt with lenders. Our pro rata share of the capital increase was
   499 million ($544 million as of December 18, 2015) and was made in return for a pro rata number of additional shares in JDE such that our ownership in JDE did not change following the
capital increase. To fund our share of the capital increase, we contributed    460 million ($501 million) of JDE receivables and made a
   39 million ($43 million) cash payment.    JDE Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements:   
 At the close of June 30, 2016, we entered into agreements with AHBV and its affiliates to establish a new stock-based compensation arrangement tied to the issuance
of JDE equity compensation awards to JDE employees. This arrangement replaced a temporary equity compensation program tied to the issuance of AHBV equity compensation to JDE employees. New Class C, D and E JDE shares were authorized and issued for
investments made by JDE employees. Under these arrangements, dilution of the JDE shares is limited to 2%. Upon execution of the agreements and the creation of the Class C, D and E JDE shares, as a percentage of the total JDE issued shares, our Class
B shares changed from 26.5% to 26.4% and AHBV s Class A shares changed from 73.5% to 73.22%, while the Class C, D and E shares, held by AHBV and its affiliates until the JDE employee awards vest, comprised 0.38% of JDE s shares.
Additional Class C shares are available to be issued when planned long-term incentive plan ( JDE LTIP ) awards vest, generally over the next five years. When the JDE Class C shares are issued in connection with the vested JDE LTIP awards,
the Class A and B relative ownership interests will decrease. Based on estimated achievement and forfeiture assumptions, we do not expect our JDE ownership interest to decrease below 26.27%. As of September 30, 2016, our ownership interest
in JDE was 26.4%.     JDE Tax Matter Resolution:     On July 19, 2016, the
Supreme Court of Spain reached a final resolution on a challenged JDE tax position held by a predecessor DEMB company that resulted in an unfavorable tax expense of    114 million ($128
million as of September 30, 2016). As a result, our earnings in the third quarter of 2016 were negatively affected by    30 million ($34 million as of September 30, 2016).  
  Keurig Transaction:     On March 3, 2016, a subsidiary of AHBV completed
the $13.9 billion acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of Keurig through a merger transaction. On March 7, 2016, we exchanged with a subsidiary of AHBV a portion of our equity interest in JDE with a carrying value of    1.7 billion (approximately $2.0 billion as of March 7, 2016) for an interest in Keurig with a fair value of $2.0 billion based on the merger consideration per share for Keurig. We recorded the
difference between the fair value of Keurig and our basis in JDE shares as a $43 million gain on equity method investment exchange in March 2016. Following the exchange, our ownership interest in JDE was 26.5% and our interest in Keurig was 24.2%.
Both AHBV and we hold our investments in Keurig through a combination of equity and interests in a shareholder loan, with pro-rata ownership of each. Our initial $2.0 billion investment in Keurig includes a $1.6 billion Keurig equity interest and a
$0.4 billion shareholder loan receivable, which are reported on a combined basis within equity method investments on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. The shareholder loan has a 5.5% interest rate and is payable
at the end of a seven-year term on February 27, 2023. We recorded equity earnings of $10 million for the three months and $39 million for the seven months ended September 30, 2016 and interest income from the shareholder loan of $6 million
for the three months and $14 million for the seven months ended September 30, 2016 within equity method earnings. Additionally, we received $2 million in the three months ended and $4 million in the seven months ended September 30, 2016 of
dividends on our investment in Keurig. We continue to account for our investments in JDE and Keurig under the equity method and recognize our share of their earnings within equity method investment earnings and our share of their dividends within
our cash flows. As of September 30, 2016, Keurig is working to finalize the acquisition purchase price allocation.

   Coffee Business Equity Earnings:   
 We have reflected the results of our historical coffee businesses and equity earnings from JDE, Keurig and DSF in our results from continuing operations as the coffee
category continues to be a significant part of our net earnings and business strategy going forward. Historically, our coffee businesses and the income from equity method investments were recorded within our operating income as these businesses were
part of our base business. While we retain an ongoing interest in coffee through equity method investments including JDE, Keurig and DSF, and we have significant influence with our equity method investments, we do not control these operations
directly. As such, in the third quarter of 2015, we began to recognize equity method investment earnings, consisting primarily of investments in coffee businesses, outside of operating income. For periods prior to the third quarter of 2015, our
historical coffee business and equity method investment earnings were included within our operating income.    The equity method investment earnings and interest
income contributed by our coffee investments included losses of $3 million from JDE, earnings of $16 million from Keurig and $11 million from DSF for the three months and earnings of $89 million from JDE, $53 million from Keurig (since March 7,
2016) and $56 million from DSF for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the equity method investment losses contributed by our coffee investments included $105 million from JDE
and the equity method investment earnings contributed by our coffee investments included $20 million from DSF. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, after-tax earnings were $296 million for the coffee businesses we contributed to JDE on
July 2, 2015 and $40 million for DSF.     Other Divestitures and Acquisitions :  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we entered into the following transactions that as of September 30, 2016, met the qualifications of held for
sale accounting. These transactions included pending sales of:  

Several manufacturing facilities in France and sale or license of several local confectionery brands. On March 31, 2016, we received a binding offer totaling
   176 million ($198 million as of September 30, 2016). Taking into account agreed upon sales price adjustments related to cash, employee-related liabilities and working capital to be
transferred at closing, we currently estimate a sales price of    220 million ($247 million as of September 30, 2016) based on net book values as of September 30, 2016. The final
sales price is subject to change as working capital and other account balances may change at the time of closing. The transactions are subject to E.U. and local regulatory approvals, completion of employee consultation requirements and additional
steps to prepare the assets for transfer. Prior to closing, together with the buyer, we will undertake consultations with all Works Councils and employee representatives required in connection with the transactions. During the third quarter, we made
progress on the pre-closing sale conditions. On March 31, 2016, we recorded a $14 million impairment charge for a gum   candy trademark as a portion of its carrying value would not be recoverable based on future cash flows expected
under a planned license agreement with the buyer. In May 2016, we recorded an additional $5 million impairment charge for another candy trademark to reduce the overall net assets to the estimated net sales proceeds after transaction costs.
Additionally, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred and accrued $84 million of incremental expenses to ready the business for the sale transactions expected to close in 2017. We recorded these costs within cost of sales and
selling, general and administrative expenses of our Europe segment.    

A chocolate factory in Belgium. We entered into this transaction in the third quarter of 2016 and expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. In connection with this transaction, we incurred and
accrued    29 million ($33 million as of September 30, 2016) of incremental expenses related to selling the factory within cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative
expense and we recorded a    30 million ($34 million as of September 30, 2016) fixed asset impairment charge within asset impairments and exit costs.    

A confectionery business in Costa Rica. We entered into this transaction in the third quarter of 2016 and expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.    

A manufacturing plant in Russia. During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a related fixed asset impairment charge of $4 million within asset impairments and exit costs.    
 As of September 30, 2016, the total held for sale assets and liabilities consisted of $139 million of current assets, $243 million of non-current assets, $39
million of current liabilities and $34 million of non-current liabilities.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we also completed the
following asset sales:  

On August 26, 2016, we recorded a $7 million gain for the sale of a U.S.-owned biscuit trademark. The gain was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016.

On May 2, 2016, we completed the sale of certain local biscuit brands in Finland as part of our strategic decisions to exit select small and local brands and shift investment towards our Power Brands. The sales
price was    14 million ($16 million as of May 2, 2016) and we recorded a pre-tax gain of $6 million ($5 million after-tax) within selling, general and administrative expenses of our Europe
segment in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We divested $8 million of indefinite lived intangible assets and less than $1 million of other assets. We received cash proceeds of
   12 million ($14 million as of May 2, 2016) upon closing and expect to receive the remaining consideration in the fourth quarter of 2016 upon the completion of post-closing conditions.
     On August 12, 2016, we announced an agreement to purchase from Burton s Biscuit Company the license that enables us to manufacture, market
and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits around the world, including in the U.K., France, Ireland, North America and Saudi Arabia. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approval. We expect that this transaction will close in the fourth quarter of
2016.    During the third quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisition of a Vietnamese biscuit operation within our Asia Pacific segment. On July 15, 2015, we
acquired an 80% interest in the biscuit operation and on August 22, 2016, we acquired the remaining 20% interest. Total cash paid for the biscuit operation, intellectual property, non-compete and consulting agreements less purchase price
adjustments was 12,404 billion Vietnamese dong ($569 million using applicable exchange rates on July 15, 2015, November 27, 2015 and August 22, 2016). We have made and received the following cash payments in connection with
the acquisition:  

On August 22, 2016, in connection with acquiring the remaining 20% interest in the biscuit operation, we released escrowed funds of $70 million and retained an agreed $20 million related to two outstanding
acquisition-related matters that are expected to be resolved in the upcoming year. We also made a final payment of 759 billion Vietnamese dong ($35 million as of August 22, 2016) for the non-compete and consulting agreements.    
 As of September 30, 2016, we have recorded a final allocation of the consideration paid including $10 million to inventory, $49 million to property, plant and
equipment, $86 million of intangible assets, $385 million of goodwill and $31 million to other net liabilities. The allocation of the fair values had an immaterial impact on operating results in periods following the initial July 15, 2015
closing date. We recorded the non-compete and consulting agreements as prepaid contracts within other current and non-current assets and they are amortized into net earnings over the contract terms. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the acquisition added $71 million in incremental net revenues and $5 million in incremental operating income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the acquisition added $70 million in incremental revenues and $16 million in
incremental operating income. Within selling, general and administrative expenses, we recorded integration costs of $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $4 million for the three months and $5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. We also recorded acquisition costs of $6 million for the three months and $7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 On April 23, 2015, we completed the divestiture of our 50% equity interest in AGF, our Japanese coffee joint venture, to our joint venture partner, which generated
cash proceeds of 27 billion Japanese yen ($225 million as of April 23, 2015) and a pre-tax gain of $13 million (after-tax loss of $9 million) in the second quarter of 2015. Upon closing, we divested our $99 million investment in the joint
venture, $65 million of goodwill and $41 million of accumulated other comprehensive losses. We also incurred approximately $7 million of transaction costs. The operating results of the divestiture were not material to our condensed consolidated
financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.    On February 16, 2015, we acquired a U.S. snack food company, Enjoy Life
Foods, within our North America segment. We paid cash and settled debt totaling $81 million in connection with the acquisition. Upon finalizing the valuation of the acquired net assets during the second quarter of 2015, we recorded an $81 million
purchase price allocation of $58 million in identifiable intangible assets, $20 million of goodwill and $3 million of other net assets. The acquisition-related costs and operating results of the acquisition were not material to our condensed
consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

   Sales of Property:     In the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we sold property within our North America segment and from our centrally held corporate assets. In the third quarter, we sold property in North America that generated cash proceeds of $10 million and a pre-tax
gain of $6 million and we sold a corporate aircraft hangar that generated cash proceeds of $3 million and a pre-tax gain of $1 million. In the second quarter of 2016, we also sold separate property in North America that generated cash proceeds of
$40 million and a pre-tax gain of $33 million and we sold a corporate aircraft that generated cash proceeds of $20 million and a pre-tax gain of $6 million. The gains were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and cash
proceeds were recorded in cash flows from other investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.     Note 3. Inventories   
 Inventories consisted of the following:      
   Capital expenditures of $909 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 exclude $274 million of accrued capital
expenditures remaining unpaid at September 30, 2016 and include payment for $322 million of capital expenditures that were accrued and unpaid at December 31, 2015.  
 In connection with our restructuring program, we recorded non-cash asset write-downs (including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments) of $120 million in the
three months and $233 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $56 million in the three months and $191 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 (see Note 6,  2014-2018 Restructuring Program ). These charges
were recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings within asset impairment and exit costs as follows:

   Note 5.   Goodwill and Intangible Assets   
 Goodwill by reportable segment was:      
   Changes to goodwill and intangibles were:  

Acquisition   During the first nine months of 2016, in connection with the acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam, we recorded a final allocation of the consideration paid including $25 million of
amortizable intangible assets and $61 million of non-amortizable intangible assets. Intangible assets acquired included trademarks and customer-related intangibles with definite and indefinite lives. A preliminary goodwill balance recorded in the
third quarter of 2015 was adjusted during the first nine months of 2016 to reflect intangible asset and other asset fair valuations. See Note 2,  Divestitures and Acquisitions   Other Divestitures and Acquisitions , for additional
information.

Asset impairments   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, in connection with our global supply chain reinvention initiatives, we made a determination to discontinue manufacturing a candy product
that resulted in a $7 million impairment charge in our North America segment, we discontinued one biscuit product that resulted in a $4 million intangible asset impairment charge in our EEMEA segment and we recorded $19 million of impairment charges
related to two gum   candy trademarks in our Europe segment, both related to the planned sale of a confectionery business in France (see Note 2,  Divestitures and Acquisitions   Other Divestitures and Acquisitions , for additional
information).    

Sale of business and assets   During the first nine months of 2016, we sold $8 million of non-amortizable intangible assets in Finland. See Note 2,  Divestitures and Acquisitions , for additional information.
     During our 2015 annual testing of non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded $71 million of impairment charges in the three months ended
December 31, 2015 related to four trademarks in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America. We also noted seven brands, including the four impaired trademarks, with $598 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2015 that each
had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. While these intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired, if expectations are
not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future.  
  Note 6.  2014-2018 Restructuring Program     On May 6, 2014, our
Board of Directors approved a $3.5 billion restructuring program, comprised of approximately $2.5 billion in cash costs and $1 billion in non-cash costs (the  2014-2018 Restructuring Program ), and up to $2.2 billion of capital
expenditures. On August 31, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a reallocation within the program of $600 million of previously approved capital expenditures to be spent on restructuring program cash costs, resulting in $3.1 billion of cash
costs to be expensed and up to $1.6 billion of capital expenditures. There was no change to the total $5.7 billion of total program costs and no change to the total $4.7 billion of cash outlays. The primary objective of the 2014-2018 Restructuring
Program is to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. The program is intended primarily to cover severance as well as asset disposals and other manufacturing-related one-time costs. Since inception, we have
incurred total restructuring and related implementation charges of $2.1 billion related to the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. We have incurred the majority of the program s charges through the third quarter of 2016 and we expect to complete
the program by year-end 2018.     Restructuring Costs :    We recorded
restructuring charges of $187 million in the three months and $480 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $146 million in the three months and $442 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 within asset
impairment and exit costs. The activity for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was:      
   We spent $89 million in the three months and $249 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $51 million in the three
months and $156 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in cash severance and related costs. We also recognized non-cash pension settlement losses (See Note 9,  Benefit Plans ), non-cash asset write-downs (including accelerated
depreciation and asset impairments) and other non-cash adjustments of $120 million in the three months and $244 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $56 million in the three months and $196 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, $302 million of our net restructuring liability was recorded within other current liabilities and $87 million was recorded within other long-term liabilities.

   Implementation Costs:   
 Implementation costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities.
We believe the disclosure of implementation costs provides readers of our financial statements with more information on the total costs of our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. Implementation costs primarily relate to reorganizing our operations and
facilities in connection with our supply chain reinvention program and other identified productivity and cost saving initiatives. The costs include incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, costs to terminate certain contracts and
the simplification of our information systems. Within our continuing results of operations, we recorded implementation costs of $114 million in the three months and $286 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $75 million in the
three months and $185 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We recorded these costs within cost of sales and general corporate expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.  
  Restructuring and Implementation Costs in Operating Income:     During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and since inception of the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, we recorded restructuring and implementation costs within operating income as follows:  

(1) 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our North America region implementation costs included incremental costs that we incurred related to re-negotiating collective bargaining agreements that expired at
the end of February 2016 for eight U.S. facilities and related to executing business continuity plans for the North America business. We expect to incur additional costs related to these activities in the fourth quarter of 2016.

   Note 7.  Debt and Borrowing Arrangements   
  Short-Term Borrowings:     Our short-term borrowings and related
weighted-average interest rates consisted of:      
   As of September 30, 2016, the commercial paper issued and outstanding had between 3 and 88 days remaining to maturity. Bank loans
include borrowings on primarily uncommitted credit lines maintained by some of our international subsidiaries to meet short-term working capital needs.  
  Borrowing Arrangements:     We maintain a $4.5 billion multi-year senior
unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs, and to support our commercial paper program. On October 14, 2016, the revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to expire on
October 11, 2018, was extended through October 11, 2021. The revolving credit agreement includes a covenant that we maintain a minimum shareholders  equity of at least $24.6 billion, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings
/ (losses) and the cumulative effects of any changes in accounting principles. At September 30, 2016, we complied with this covenant as our shareholders  equity, as defined by the covenant, was $37.2 billion. The revolving credit facility
agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. There are no credit rating triggers, provisions or other financial covenants that could require us to post collateral as security. As of September 30, 2016, no
amounts were drawn on the facility.    Some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet short-term working capital needs.
Collectively, these credit lines amounted to $1.8 billion at September 30, 2016 and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2015. Borrowings on these lines amounted to $315 million at September 30, 2016 and $236 million at December 31,
2015.     Long-Term Debt:     On October 17, 2016, we announced a cash
tender offer to retire some of our long-term debt. We expect to complete the tender in the fourth quarter of 2016. We have not yet determined the notes to be retired and the full impact to our operating results. We expect to finance the repurchase
of these notes, including the payment of accrued interest and other costs incurred, from net proceeds received from the $3.75 billion note issuance, expected to close on October 28, 2016, and the term loans, both described below.  
 On October 19, 2016, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. ( MIHN ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Mondel z International, Inc.,
launched an offering of $3.75 billion of notes, guaranteed by Mondel z International, Inc. The $1.75 billion of 1.625% notes and the $500 million of floating rate notes will mature on October 28, 2019 and the $1.5 billion of 2.0%
notes will mature on October 28, 2021. On October 28, 2016, we expect to receive proceeds, net of discounts and associated financing costs, of $3.73 billion. Proceeds from the notes issuance will be used for general corporate purposes,
including to grant loans or make distributions to Mondel z International, Inc. or its subsidiaries to fund all or a portion of the October 2016 cash tender offer and near-term debt maturities. We expect to amortize deferred financing costs into
interest expense over the life of the notes. We entered into cross-currency swaps, serving as cash flow hedges, so that the U.S. dollar-denominated debt payments will effectively be paid in euros over the life of the debt.  
 On October 14, 2016, MIHN executed a $1.5 billion bank term loan facility. The loan facility consists of two $750 million loans, one with a three-year maturity and
the other with a five-year maturity. The term loans can be drawn at any time for 60 days after signing. On October 25, 2016, we gave notice of our intent to fully draw on the loan with a five-year maturity, and we expect funding to occur on October
28, 2016. Proceeds from the $750 million term loan may be used for general corporate purposes, including funding of the tender offer or other debt. On October 25, 2016, we also gave notice of our intent to terminate the $750 million
loan with the three-year maturity.    On February 9, 2016, $1,750 million of our 4.125% U.S. dollar notes matured. The notes and accrued interest to date were
paid with net proceeds from the  fr .400 million Swiss franc-denominated notes issued on January 26, 2016 and the    700 million euro-denominated notes issued on January 21,
2016, as well as cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper. As we refinanced $1,150 million of the matured notes with net proceeds from the long-term debt issued in January 2016, we reflected this amount within long-term debt as of
December 31, 2015.

  On January 26, 2016, we issued  fr .400 million of Swiss franc-denominated notes, or $399 million in U.S. dollars
locked in with a forward currency contract on January 12, 2016, consisting of:  
 
   We received
proceeds, net of premiums and deferred financing costs, of $398 million that were used to partially fund the February 2016 note maturity and for other general corporate purposes. We recorded approximately $1 million of premiums and deferred
financing costs, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes.    On January 21, 2016, we issued    700 million of euro-denominated 1.625% notes, or $760 million in U.S. dollars locked in with a forward currency contract on January 13, 2016. The euro-denominated notes will mature on
January 20, 2023. We received proceeds, net of discounts and deferred financing costs, of $752 million that were used to partially fund the February 2016 note maturity and for other general corporate purposes. We recorded approximately $8
million of discounts and deferred financing costs, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes.    Our weighted-average interest rate on
our total debt was 3.1% as of September 30, 2016, following the refinancing of the February 9, 2016 debt maturity. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt was 3.7% as of December 31, 2015, down from 4.3% as of
December 31, 2014.     Fair Value of Our Debt:     The fair value of our
short-term borrowings at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 reflects current market interest rates and approximates the amounts we have recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of our long-term debt was
determined using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 valuation data) for the publicly traded debt obligations. At September 30, 2016, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $18,616 million and its carrying value was $17,106
million. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $15,908 million and its carrying value was $15,398 million.     Interest and

  Level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of exchange-traded commodity futures and listed options. The fair value of
these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges. Our exchange-traded derivatives are generally subject to master netting arrangements that permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty when
certain criteria are met, such as in the event of default. We also are required to maintain cash margin accounts in connection with funding the settlement of our open positions, and the margin requirements generally fluctuate daily based on market
conditions. We have recorded margin deposits related to our exchange-traded derivatives of $16 million as of September 30, 2016 and margin deposits of $22 million as of December 31, 2015 within other current assets. Based on our net asset
or liability positions with individual counterparties, in the event of default and immediate net settlement of all of our open positions, for derivatives we have in a net asset position, our counterparties would owe us a total of $32 million as of
September 30, 2016 and $52 million as of December 31, 2015. For derivatives we have in a net liability position, we would owe less than $1 million as of September 30, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, there were no Level 1
derivatives in a net liability position.    Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter ( OTC ) currency exchange
forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional
amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as
commodity prices. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of
financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts.
Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our commodity and currency exchange OTC derivatives do not have a legal right of set-off. In connection with our OTC derivatives that could be
net-settled in the event of default, assuming all parties were to fail to comply with the terms of the agreements, for derivatives we have in a net liability position, we would owe $36 million as of September 30, 2016 and $101 million as of
December 31, 2015, and for derivatives we have in a net asset position, our counterparties would owe us a total of $54 million as of September 30, 2016 and $64 million as of December 31, 2015. We manage the credit risk in connection
with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.

   Cash Flow Hedges:     Cash flow
hedge activity, net of taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) included:      
   Cash flow hedge ineffectiveness was not material for all periods presented.  
 Within interest and other expense, net, we recorded pre-tax losses of $97 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $34 million in the first quarter of 2015 related to
amounts excluded from effectiveness testing. These amounts relate to interest rate swaps no longer designated as cash flow hedges due to changes in financing plans. Due to lower overall costs and our decision to hedge a greater portion of our net
investments in operations that use currencies other than the U.S. dollar as their functional currencies, our plans to issue U.S. dollar-denominated debt changed and we instead issued euro and Swiss franc-denominated notes in the current year first
quarter, and euro, British pound sterling and Swiss franc-denominated notes in the prior-year first quarter. Amounts excluded from effectiveness testing were not material for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015.  
 We record pre-tax and after-tax (i) gains or losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) into earnings, (ii) gains or losses
on ineffectiveness and (iii) gains or losses on amounts excluded from effectiveness testing in:  

cost of sales for commodity contracts;    

cost of sales for currency exchange contracts related to forecasted transactions; and    

interest and other expense, net for interest rate contracts and currency exchange contracts related to intercompany loans.    
 Based on current market conditions, we would expect to transfer unrealized gains of $11 million (net of taxes) for commodity cash flow hedges, unrealized losses of $11
million (net of taxes) for currency cash flow hedges and unrealized losses of less than $1 million (net of taxes) for interest rate cash flow hedges to earnings during the next 12 months.

In connection with the JDE coffee business transactions, we entered
into a number of consecutive euro to U.S. dollar currency exchange forward contracts in 2015 to lock in an equivalent expected value in U.S. dollars. The mark-to-market gains and losses on the derivatives were recorded in earnings. We recorded net
gains of $29 million for the three months and $436 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 within interest and other expense, net in connection with the forward contracts and the transferring of proceeds to our subsidiaries where
coffee net assets and shares were deconsolidated. The currency hedge and related gains and losses were recorded within interest and other expense, net. See Note 2,  Divestitures and Acquisitions   JDE Coffee Business Transactions , for

   Note 9. Benefit Plans   
  Pension Plans      Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost:   
 Net periodic pension cost consisted of the following:      
   Net periodic pension cost decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to a combination of factors, including a
decreased number of plan participants, changes in discount rates, company contributions to the plans and a change in our approach to measuring service and interest costs. For 2015, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single
weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. For 2016, we have elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans  liability
cash flows. We believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans  liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. The impact of this change
was a decrease in net periodic pension cost of approximately $16 million for the three months and $48 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This change does not affect the measurement of our plan obligations. We have accounted
for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, have accounted for it on a prospective basis.    Net pension costs of our non-U.S. plans in the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were also favorably impacted by the reduction in our pension plan obligations due to the JDE coffee business transactions. Prior to the July 2, 2015 closing of the JDE coffee business
transactions, certain active employees who transitioned to JDE participated in our non-U.S. pension plans. Following the transactions, benefits began to be provided directly by JDE to participants continuing with JDE. JDE assumed certain pension
plan obligations and received the related plan assets. In 2015, we reduced our net benefit plan liabilities by $131 million and the related deferred tax assets by $24 million. Prior to the transactions, for the nine months ended September 30,
2015, amortization of prior service cost includes $17 million of pension curtailment losses related to employees who subsequently transitioned to JDE. Refer to Note 2,  Divestitures and Acquisitions   JDE Coffee Business Transactions , for
more information. For participants that elected not to transfer into the JDE plans, we retained the plan obligations and related plan assets.

  Settlement losses also include pension settlement losses for employees who elected lump-sum payments in connection with our
2014-2018 Restructuring Program. These settlement losses were $3 million for the three months and $12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1 million for the three months and $7 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. See Note 6,  2014-2018 Restructuring Program , for more information. We also recorded an additional $49 million of pension settlement losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to the JDE coffee
business transactions within the gain on the JDE coffee business transactions.     Employer Contributions:   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we contributed $169 million (of which, $150 million was voluntarily contributed) to our U.S. plans and $329 million
(of which, $100 million was a non-recurring contribution related to merging our and legacy Cadbury plans in the U.K.) to our non-U.S. plans. As of September 30, 2016, we plan to make further contributions of approximately $6 million to our U.S.
plans and approximately $50 million to our non-U.S. plans during the remainder of 2016. However, our actual contributions may differ due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws or significant differences between expected and
actual pension asset performance or interest rates.     Postretirement Benefit Plans

   Share Repurchase Program:   
 During 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $7.7 billion of our Common Stock through December 31, 2016. On July 29, 2015, our Finance
Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the authorization to $13.7 billion of Common Stock repurchases, and extended the program through
December 31, 2018. Repurchases under the program are determined by management and are wholly discretionary. Prior to January 1, 2016, we had repurchased $8.2 billion of Common Stock pursuant to this authorization. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased 42.9 million shares of Common Stock at an average cost of $41.64 per share, or an aggregate cost of $1.8 billion, of which $1.7 billion was paid during the period. All share repurchases were funded
through available cash and commercial paper issuances. As of September 30, 2016, we have $3.7 billion in remaining share repurchase capacity.     Note 11.
Commitments and Contingencies      Legal Proceedings:     We routinely are
involved in legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations ( Legal Matters ) arising in the ordinary course of our business.    A
compliant and ethical corporate culture, which includes adhering to laws and industry regulations in all jurisdictions in which we do business, is integral to our success. Accordingly, after we acquired Cadbury in February 2010, we began reviewing
and adjusting, as needed, Cadbury s operations in light of applicable standards as well as our policies and practices. We initially focused on such high priority areas as food safety, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) and
antitrust. Based upon Cadbury s pre-acquisition policies and compliance programs and our post-acquisition reviews, our preliminary findings indicated that Cadbury s overall state of compliance was sound. Nonetheless, through our reviews,
we determined that in certain jurisdictions, including India, there appeared to be facts and circumstances warranting further investigation. We are continuing our investigations in certain jurisdictions, including in India, and we continue to
cooperate with governmental authorities.    As we previously disclosed, on February 1, 2011, we received a subpoena from the SEC in connection with an
investigation under the FCPA, primarily related to a facility in India that we acquired in the Cadbury acquisition. The subpoena primarily requests information regarding dealings with Indian governmental agencies and officials to obtain approvals
related to the operation of that facility. We are continuing to cooperate with the U.S. and Indian governments in their investigations of these matters. On February 11, 2016, we received a  Wells  notice from the SEC indicating that
the staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against us for violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act ), in connection with the investigation. On March 18, 2016, we made a submission to the staff of the SEC in response to the notice. We have engaged in discussions with the SEC and with the U.S. Department of Justice to
discuss potential resolution of their respective investigations. We have not reached a settlement to resolve these investigations, and we are unable to predict when or if we can reach a mutually satisfactory resolution.  
 In February 2013 and March 2014, Cadbury India Limited (now known as Mondelez India Foods Private Limited), a subsidiary of Mondel z International, and other
parties received show cause notices from the Indian Central Excise Authority (the  Excise Authority ) calling upon the parties to demonstrate why the Excise Authority should not collect a total of 3.7 billion Indian rupees ($56 million as
of September 30, 2016) of unpaid excise tax and an equivalent amount of penalties, as well as interest, related to production at the same Indian facility. We contested these demands for unpaid excise taxes, penalties and interest. On
March 27, 2015, after several hearings, the Commissioner of the Excise Authority issued an order denying the excise exemption that we claimed for the Indian facility and confirming the Excise Authority s demands for total taxes and
penalties in the amount of 5.8 billion Indian rupees ($88 million as of September 30, 2016). We have appealed this order. In addition, the Excise Authority issued additional show cause notices on February 6, 2015 and December 8, 2015
on the same issue but covering the periods January to October 2014 and November 2014 to September 2015, respectively. These notices added a total of 2.4 billion Indian rupees ($36 million as of September 30, 2016) of unpaid excise taxes as well
as penalties to be determined up to an amount equivalent to that claimed by the Excise Authority and interest. We believe that the decision to claim the excise tax benefit is valid and we are continuing to contest the show cause notices through the
administrative and judicial process.

  In April 2013, the staff of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) advised us and Kraft Foods
Group that it was investigating activities related to the trading of December 2011 wheat futures contracts that occurred prior to the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group. We cooperated with the staff in its investigation. On April 1, 2015, the CFTC
filed a complaint against Kraft Foods Group and Mondel z Global LLC ( Mondel z Global ) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (the  CFTC action ). The complaint alleges that
Kraft Foods Group and Mondel z Global (1) manipulated or attempted to manipulate the wheat markets during the fall of 2011; (2) violated position limit levels for wheat futures and (3) engaged in non-competitive trades by trading
both sides of exchange-for-physical Chicago Board of Trade wheat contracts. The CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties of either triple the monetary gain for each violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (the  Act ) or $1 million for each
violation of Section 6(c)(1), 6(c)(3) or 9(a)(2) of the Act and $140,000 for each additional violation of the Act, plus post-judgment interest; an order of permanent injunction prohibiting Kraft Foods Group and Mondel z Global from
violating specified provisions of the Act; disgorgement of profits; and costs and fees. In December 2015, the court denied Mondel z Global and Kraft Foods Group s motion to dismiss the CFTC s claims of market manipulation and
attempted manipulation, and the parties are now in discovery. Additionally, several class action complaints were filed against Kraft Foods Group and Mondel z Global in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by investors
in wheat futures and options on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. The complaints make similar allegations as those made in the CFTC action and seek class action certification; an unspecified amount for damages, interest and unjust
enrichment; costs and fees; and injunctive, declaratory, and other unspecified relief. In June 2015, these suits were consolidated in the Northern District of Illinois. In June 2016, the court denied Mondel z Global and Kraft Foods Group s
motion to dismiss, and the parties are now in discovery. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters; however, based on our Separation and Distribution Agreement with Kraft Foods Group dated as of September 27, 2012, we expect to
predominantly bear any monetary penalties or other payments in connection with the CFTC action.    While we cannot predict with certainty the results of any Legal
Matters in which we are currently involved, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of these Legal Matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our financial results.  
  Third-Party Guarantees:     We enter into third-party guarantees primarily to
cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At September 30, 2016, we had no material third-party guarantees
recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet.

 The following table summarizes the changes in the accumulated balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) attributable to
Mondel z International. Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) to net earnings (net of tax) were net losses of $28 million in the three months and $206 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and $134 million in the three months and $172 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

 These reclassified gains or losses are recorded within interest and other expense, net.       Note 13.  Income
Taxes     Based on current tax laws, our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2016 is 20.8%, reflecting favorable impacts from the mix of pre-tax income in
various non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. Our 2016 third quarter effective tax rate of 7.2% includes net benefit from discrete one-time events of $60 million, mainly due to $35 million from expirations of statutes of limitations and favorable audit
settlements in several jurisdictions and a $17 million benefit from the reduction of U.K. net deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2016 Q3 that reduced the U.K. corporate income tax rate. Our effective tax rate for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of 13.6% was favorably impacted by net tax benefit from $109 million of discrete one-time events. The discrete net tax benefit primarily consisted of benefits of $73 million due to expirations of
statutes of limitations and favorable audit settlements in several jurisdictions and a $17 million benefit from the reduction of U.K. net deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during the third quarter of 2016 that reduced
the U.K. corporate income tax rate.    As of the third quarter of 2015, our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2015 was 23.1%, reflecting favorable impacts from
the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. Our 2015 third quarter effective tax rate of 4.5% benefitted from the one-time third quarter sale of our coffee business that resulted in a pre-tax gain of $7,122 million and $197
million of related tax expense, as well as $21 million of tax costs incurred to remit proceeds up from lower-tier foreign subsidiaries to allow cash to be redeployed within our retained foreign operations. Other discrete one-time events, which
partially offset the costs associated with the sale of our coffee business, of $40 million primarily related to favorable audit settlements and expirations of statutes of limitations in several jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 of 6.5% was favorably impacted by the sale of our coffee business in the third quarter. Other significant discrete one-time events consisted of $54 million of tax charges related to the sale of our interest in
AGF ($32 million in the first quarter upon the investment s change to held-for-sale status and an additional $22 million upon the closing of the sale in the second quarter), and $75 million from favorable audit settlements and expirations of
statutes of limitations in several jurisdictions.     Note 14.  Earnings Per Share   
 Basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) were calculated as follows:

  We exclude antidilutive Mondel z International stock options from our calculation of weighted-average shares for
diluted EPS. We excluded antidilutive stock options of 4.3 million for the three months and 7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and less than 1 million for the three months and 10.8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.     Note 15.  Segment Reporting   
 We manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum   candy and various
cheese   grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products. We manage our global business and report operating results through geographic units.    Our
operations and management structure are organized into five reportable operating segments:  

Latin America    

Asia Pacific    

EEMEA    

Europe    

North America      On October 1, 2016, we integrated our EEMEA business into our Europe and Asia Pacific segments.
Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined within our Europe operating segment, while the remaining Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific operating segment to form a new Asia, Middle East
and Africa ( AMEA ) regional operating segment.    We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing
business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.  
 Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments were part of our base business. Beginning in the
third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for our new coffee equity method investment in JDE, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of segment operating income.
Within segment operating income, equity method investment net earnings were $56 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, including $49 million in Asia Pacific, $3 million in EEMEA and $4 million in North America. See Note 1,
 Basis of Presentation   Principles of Consolidation,  and Note 2,  Divestitures and Acquisitions , for additional information.    We use segment
operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on
hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on divestitures or acquisitions, gain on
the JDE coffee business transactions, loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating
income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, we do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment
profitability measure that management reviews.

 On July 2, 2015, we contributed our global coffee businesses primarily from our Europe, EEMEA and Asia Pacific segment beverage categories. Net revenues of our global coffee business were $1,348 million in Europe,
$246 million in EEMEA and $33 million in Asia Pacific for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Refer to Note 2,  Divestitures and Acquisitions   JDE Coffee Business Transactions , for more information.

 Our Venezuelan subsidiaries net revenues of $209 million in biscuits, $95 million in cheese   grocery, $6 million in beverages and $5 million in gum   candy for the three months and $496 million in
biscuits, $231 million in cheese   grocery, $66 million in gum   candy and $41 million in beverages for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Beginning in
2016, we account for our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting and no longer include net revenues of our Venezuelan subsidiaries within our condensed consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 1,  Basis of Presentation
  Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting: Venezuela,  for more information.

     Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.      Description of the Company     We manufacture and market
primarily snack food products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum   candy and various cheese   grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products. We have operations in more than 80
countries and sell our products in 165 countries.    Over the last several years, we have built a presence in the snacking category. We have expanded geographically
and continue to invest in product quality, marketing and innovation behind our iconic brands while also implementing a series of cost saving initiatives. Our goals are to achieve industry-leading revenue growth over time driven by the higher
expected growth rates of advantaged snack categories; leverage our cost structure through supply chain reinvention, productivity programs, overhead streamlining, volume growth and improved product mix to drive margin gains; and grow earnings per
share in the top-tier of our peer group.     Significant Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results   
  JDE Coffee Business Transactions:     On July 2, 2015, we completed
transactions to combine our wholly owned coffee businesses with those of D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V. ( DEMB ) to create a new company, Jacobs Douwe Egberts ( JDE ). Following the exchange of a portion of our investment in JDE
for an interest in Keurig Green Mountain Inc. ( Keurig ) in March 2016, we held a 26.5% equity interest in JDE. The remaining 73.5% equity interest in JDE was held by a subsidiary of Acorn Holdings B.V. ( AHBV,  owner of DEMB
prior to July 2, 2015). Please see discussion of the acquisition of an interest in Keurig below under  Keurig Transaction . As of September 30, 2016, we hold a 26.4% equity interest in JDE following the transactions discussed under
 JDE Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements  below.    The consideration we received in the JDE coffee business transactions completed on July 2, 2015,
consisted of    3.8 billion of cash ($4.2 billion as of July 2, 2015), a 43.5% equity interest in JDE (prior to the decrease in ownership due to the Keurig transaction and the compensation
arrangements discussed below )  and $794 million in receivables (related to sales price adjustments and tax formation cost payments). During the third quarter of 2015, we also recorded $283 million of cash and receivables from JDE related to
reimbursement of costs that we incurred in separating our coffee businesses. The cash and equity consideration we received at closing reflects that we retained our interest in a Korea-based joint venture, Dongsuh Foods Corporation ( DSF ).
During the second quarter of 2015, we also completed the sale of our interest in a Japanese coffee joint venture, Ajinomoto General Foods, Inc. ( AGF ). In lieu of contributing our interest in the AGF joint venture to JDE, we contributed
the net cash proceeds from the sale as part of the overall JDE coffee business transactions. Please see Note 2,  Divestitures and Acquisitions   Other Divestitures and Acquisitions , for discussion of the divestiture of AGF.  
 On July 5, 2016, we received an expected cash payment of $275 million from JDE to settle the receivable related to tax formation costs that were part of the
initial sales price.    In connection with the contribution of our global coffee businesses to JDE on July 2, 2015, we recorded a final pre-tax gain of $6.8
billion (or $6.6 billion after taxes) in 2015 after final adjustments as described below. We also recorded approximately $1.0 billion of pre-tax net gains related to hedging the expected cash proceeds from the transactions as described further
below. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we and JDE concluded negotiations of a sales price adjustment and completed the valuation of our investment in JDE. Primarily due to the negotiated resolution of the sales price adjustment in the fourth
quarter of 2015, we recorded a $313 million reduction in the pre-tax gain on the coffee transaction, reducing the $7.1 billion estimated gain in the third quarter of 2015 to the $6.8 billion final gain for 2015. As part of our sales price
negotiations, we retained the right to collect future cash payments if certain estimated pension liabilities are realized over an agreed amount in the future. As such, we may recognize additional income related to this negotiated term in the future.
   The final value of our investment in JDE on July 2, 2015 was    4.1 billion ($4.5 billion as of
July 2, 2015). The fair value of the JDE investment was determined using both income-based and market-based valuation techniques. The discounted cash flow analysis reflected growth, discount and tax rates and other assumptions reflecting the
underlying combined businesses and countries in which the combined coffee businesses operate. The fair value of the JDE investment also included the fair values of the  Carte Noire  and  Merrild  businesses, which JDE agreed to divest to
comply with the conditioned approval by the European Commission related to the JDE coffee business transactions. As of the end of the first quarter of 2016, these businesses were sold by JDE. As the July 2, 2015 fair values for these businesses
were recorded by JDE at their pending sales values, we did not record any gain or loss on the sales of these businesses in our share of JDE s earnings.

  In connection with the expected receipt of cash in euros at the time of closing, we entered into a number of consecutive
currency exchange forward contracts in 2014 and 2015 to lock in an equivalent expected value in U.S. dollars as of the date the JDE coffee business transactions were first announced in May 2014. Cumulatively, we realized aggregate net gains and
received cash of approximately $1.0 billion on these hedging contracts that increased the cash we received in connection with the JDE coffee business transactions from $4.2 billion in cash consideration received to $5.2 billion. In connection with
these currency contracts, we recognized net gains of $29 million in the three months and $436 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 within interest and other expense, net.  
  JDE Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements:     At the close of June 30,
2016, we entered into agreements with AHBV and its affiliates to establish a new stock-based compensation arrangement tied to the issuance of JDE equity compensation awards to JDE employees. This arrangement replaced a temporary equity compensation
program tied to the issuance of AHBV equity compensation to JDE employees. New Class C, D and E JDE shares were authorized and issued for investments made by JDE employees. Under these arrangements, dilution of the JDE shares is limited to 2%. Upon
execution of the agreements and the creation of the Class C, D and E JDE shares, as a percentage of the total JDE issued shares, our Class B shares changed from 26.5% to 26.4% and AHBV s Class A shares changed from 73.5% to 73.22%, while
the Class C, D and E shares, held by AHBV and its affiliates until the JDE employee awards vest, comprised 0.38% of JDE s shares. Additional Class C shares are available to be issued when planned long-term incentive plan ( JDE LTIP )
awards vest, generally over the next five years. When the JDE Class C shares are issued in connection with the vested JDE LTIP awards, the Class A and B relative ownership interests will decrease. Based on estimated achievement and forfeiture
assumptions, we do not expect our JDE ownership interest to decrease below 26.27%. As of September 30, 2016, our ownership interest in JDE was 26.4%.     JDE
Tax Matter Resolution:     On July 19, 2016, the Supreme Court of Spain reached a final resolution on a challenged JDE tax position held by a predecessor DEMB
company that resulted in an unfavorable tax expense of    114 million ($128 million as of September 30, 2016). As a result, our earnings in the third quarter of 2016 were negatively
affected by    30 million ($34 million as of September 30, 2016).     Keurig Transaction:   
 On March 3, 2016, a subsidiary of AHBV completed the $13.9 billion acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of Keurig through a merger transaction. On
March 7, 2016, we exchanged with a subsidiary of AHBV a portion of our equity interest in JDE with a carrying value of    1.7 billion (approximately $2.0 billion as of March 7, 2016) for
an interest in Keurig with a fair value of $2.0 billion based on the merger consideration per share for Keurig. We recorded the difference between the fair value of Keurig and our basis in JDE shares as a $43 million gain on equity method investment
exchange in March 2016. Following the exchange, our ownership interest in JDE was 26.5% and our interest in Keurig was 24.2%. Both AHBV and we hold our investments in Keurig through a combination of equity and interests in a shareholder loan, with
pro-rata ownership of each. Our initial $2.0 billion investment in Keurig includes a $1.6 billion Keurig equity interest and a $0.4 billion shareholder loan receivable, which are reported on a combined basis within equity method investments on our
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. The shareholder loan has a 5.5% interest rate and is payable at the end of a seven-year term on February 27, 2023. We recorded equity earnings of $10 million for the three
months and $39 million for the seven months ended September 30, 2016 and interest income from the shareholder loan of $6 million for the three months and $14 million for the seven months ended September 30, 2016 within equity method
earnings. Additionally, we received $2 million in the three months ended and $4 million in the seven months ended September 30, 2016 of dividends on our investment in Keurig. We continue to account for our investments in JDE and Keurig under
the equity method and recognize our share of their earnings within equity method investment earnings and our share of their dividends within our cash flows. As of September 30, 2016, Keurig is working to finalize the acquisition purchase price
allocation.     Coffee Business Equity Earnings:     We have reflected the
results of our historical coffee businesses and equity earnings from JDE, Keurig and DSF in our results from continuing operations as the coffee category continues to be a significant part of our net earnings and business strategy going forward.
Historically, our coffee businesses and the income from equity method investments were recorded within our operating income as these businesses were part of our base business. While we retain an ongoing interest in coffee through equity method
investments including JDE, Keurig and DSF, and we have significant influence with our equity method investments, we do not control these operations directly. As such, in the third quarter of 2015, we began to recognize equity method investment
earnings, consisting primarily of investments in coffee businesses, outside of operating income. For periods prior to the third quarter of 2015, our historical coffee business and equity method investment earnings were included within our operating
income. See Note 2,  Divestitures and Acquisitions,  for more information.

   Venezuela Deconsolidation:   
 Effective as of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we concluded that we no longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries due to a
loss of control over our Venezuelan operations and an other-than-temporary lack of currency exchangeability. As of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our Venezuelan operations. We
recorded a $778 million pre-tax loss on December 31, 2015 as we reduced the value of our cost method investment in Venezuela and all Venezuelan receivables held by our other subsidiaries to realizable fair value, resulting in full impairment.
The recorded loss also included historical cumulative translation adjustments related to our Venezuelan operations that had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses within equity.  
 Beginning in 2016, we no longer include net revenues, earnings or net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries within our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Under the cost method of accounting, earnings are only recognized to the extent cash is received. Given the current and ongoing difficult economic, regulatory and business environment in Venezuela, there continues to be significant uncertainty
related to our operations in Venezuela, and we expect these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. We will monitor the extent of our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and the liquidity and availability of U.S. dollars at
different rates as our current situation in Venezuela may change over time and lead to consolidation at a future date. See below  Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results   Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results , and Note
1,  Basis of Presentation    Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting: Venezuela , for more information on our historical Venezuelan operating results, including the remeasurement loss recorded in the first quarter of
2015.     Financial Outlook     We seek to achieve top-tier financial
performance. We manage our business to achieve this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations such as margins internally to
evaluate and manage our business, plan and make near and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. GAAP financial results.
We believe providing investors with the same financial information that we use internally ensures that investors have the same data to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and have
additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should always be considered in relation to our GAAP results and we have provided reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial
measures in  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  which appears later in this section.    In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of
developments or trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives.  

Following the June 2016   Brexit  referendum vote, the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) is moving forward with plans to exit the European Union ( E.U. ). When announced, Brexit caused
volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, affecting the markets in which we conduct business. Also, the value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar declined, and the value of primarily the pound sterling
continued to be negatively affected following the vote. Further volatility in the exchange rate is expected over the transition period. While we have not experienced significant business disruptions in our U.K. businesses immediately following the
referendum, the devaluation of the British pound sterling adversely affected our translated results reported in U.S. dollars. We have a natural hedge in the form of pound-sterling denominated debt that acts as a net investment hedge, moving counter
to adverse pound sterling currency translation impacts. British pound sterling currency transaction risks are also mitigated in part due to our global chocolate businesses buying cocoa in British pound sterling. In recent months, cocoa prices in
British pound sterling have been volatile and trading above historic levels, largely in response to the recent devaluation of the pound. On a global basis, the impact to our chocolate businesses is mitigated as we purchase cocoa at a higher cost but
with less expensive British pound sterling. We may not be able to fully offset the increased risks within the U.K., which could impact profitability in the near-term or longer should these conditions continue. While we continue to monitor and work
to safeguard our business, the U.K. decision to leave the E.U. could adversely affect future demand for our products, our financial results and operations, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the short or long-term.

On February 29, 2016, the collective bargaining agreements covering eight U.S. facilities expired and we began the re-negotiation of these agreements. We continue to work toward reaching an agreement with the union
and have made plans to ensure business continuity during the re-negotiations.    

In the fourth quarter of 2016, we began the integration of our EEMEA business into our Europe and Asia Pacific segments. We expect this change to have a favorable impact on our operating performance beginning in late
2016 and prospectively due to the consolidation of offices and overhead reduction.      We also continue to note trends similar to those we highlighted in
our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In particular, volatility in the global commodity and currency markets continued through the third quarter of 2016, including most recently the impact from
Brexit and currency devaluation issues noted in other countries. Refer to  Commodity Trends  appearing later in this section and Note 1,  Basis of Presentation   Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting , for additional
information on our commodity costs and specific currency risks we are monitoring. Also refer to Note 6,  2014-2018 Restructuring Program , for additional information on the North America region collective bargaining agreement re-negotiations,
and Note 15, S egment Reporting , for information on our segments and information on our EEMEA segment.     Summary of Results   

Net revenues decreased 6.6% to $6.4 billion in the third quarter of 2016 and decreased 14.0% to $19.2 billion in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Net revenues in 2016 were
significantly affected by the July 2, 2015 contribution of our global coffee business to JDE, unfavorable currency translation as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior
year, the deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations and the year-over-year impact of last year s accounting calendar change and the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries.    

Organic Net Revenue increased 1.1% to $6.6 billion in the third quarter of 2016 and increased 1.6% to $20.1 billion in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Organic Net Revenue
is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate our underlying results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  appearing later in this section).

Diluted EPS attributable to Mondel z International decreased 92.2% to $0.35 in the third quarter of 2016 and decreased 79.6% to $0.99 in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same periods in the prior
year. A number of significant items also affected the comparability of our reported results, as further described in the  Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results  appearing later in this section and in the notes to the condensed
consolidated financial statements.        

Adjusted EPS increased 36.8% to $0.52 in the third quarter of 2016 and increased 22.5% to $1.47 in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted
EPS increased 42.1% to $0.54 in the third quarter of 2016 and increased 27.5% to $1.53 in the first nine months of 2016. Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our underlying
results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  appearing later in this section).

 Includes the historical results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries prior to the December 31, 2015 deconsolidation. Refer to Note 1,  Basis of Presentation   Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary
Accounting: Venezuela,  for more information.      Net revenue decline of 6.6% was driven by the deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan
operations, unfavorable currency and the year-over-year impact of last year s accounting calendar change, partially offset by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 1.1%. The deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations
resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $315 million for the quarter. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $193 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including
the British pound sterling, Argentinean peso and Mexican peso, partially offset by the strength of the Brazilian real, Australian dollar and Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The North America segment accounting calendar change made in 2015
resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $19 million in the quarter. Our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the benefit of carryover
pricing from 2015 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the quarter. Higher net pricing was reflected in Latin America and EEMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific.
Favorable volume/mix was reflected in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and EEMEA. Unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and EEMEA was largely due to price elasticity as well as
strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines.

  During the quarter, we realized higher net pricing while input costs increased modestly. Higher net pricing, which included
the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2015, was reflected in Latin America and EEMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in
part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, which were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, partially offset
by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and EEMEA.    Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $238 million from the third quarter of 2015, due
to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, lower costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions, a favorable currency impact, value-added tax (VAT)-related settlements, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan
operations, gains on sales of property, gain on the sale of an intangible asset and the absence of acquisition-related costs.    Excluding the factors noted above,
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $75 million from the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven primarily by lower overhead costs due to continued cost reduction efforts, and lower advertising and consumer promotions
costs.    The change in mark-to-market gains / (losses) from derivatives decreased operating income by $8 million in the third quarter of 2016. In the third quarter
of 2016, the net unrealized losses on commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives were $12 million, as compared to net unrealized losses of $4 million in the third quarter of 2015.  
 Unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $31 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the
British pound sterling and Argentinean peso, partially offset by the strength of the Brazilian real, Australian dollar and Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar.  
 Operating income margin decreased from 113.9% in the third quarter of 2015 to 11.0% in the third quarter of 2016. The decrease in operating income margin was driven
primarily by last year s pre-tax gain on the JDE coffee business transactions, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations. The items that decreased our operating income
margin were partially offset by an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin and the absence of costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 13.6% in the third quarter of 2015 to
15.8% in the third quarter of 2016. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by lower overhead costs resulting from our cost reduction programs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and improved gross margin
reflecting productivity efforts.

 Includes the historical results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries prior to the December 31, 2015 deconsolidation. Refer to Note 1,  Basis of Presentation   Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary
Accounting: Venezuela,  for more information.      Net revenue decline of 14.0% was driven by the impact of the deconsolidation of our historical
coffee business, unfavorable currency, the deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations and the year-over-year impact of last year s accounting calendar change, partially offset by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 1.6%
and the impact of last year s acquisitions. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,627 million for the first nine months of 2016. Unfavorable currency
impacts decreased net revenues by $996 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, British pound sterling, Brazilian real, Mexican peso, Russian ruble and Chinese yuan.
The deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $834 million for the first nine months of 2016. The North America segment accounting calendar change made in 2015 resulted in a
year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $57 million for the first nine months of 2016. Our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the
benefit of carryover pricing from 2015 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the first nine months of 2016. Higher net pricing was reflected in Latin America, EEMEA, and Asia Pacific, partially offset by lower net
pricing in Europe and North America. Unfavorable volume/mix was reflected in Latin America and EEMEA, mostly offset by favorable volume/mix in all other segments. Unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and EEMEA was largely due to price elasticity
as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. The impact of acquisitions primarily includes the July 15, 2015 acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam, which added $71 million of incremental net revenues for the
first nine months of 2016.

 During the first nine months of 2016, we realized higher net pricing while input costs increased modestly. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of
pricing actions taken in 2015, was reflected across all segments except Europe and North America. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials,
which were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, which was mostly offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and EEMEA.  
 Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $840 million from the first nine months of 2015, due to a number of factors noted in the table above,
including in part, the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, a favorable currency impact, lower costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, gains on the sales of
property, VAT-related settlements and the absence of devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela in 2016. The decreases were partially offset by increases from divestiture-related costs associated with the planned sale of a
confectionery business in France, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the impact of acquisitions.  
 Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $192 million from the first nine months of 2015. The decrease was driven
primarily by lower overhead costs due to continued cost reduction efforts, partially offset by higher advertising and consumer promotions support, particularly behind our Power Brands.  
 Excluding the portion related to deconsolidating our historical coffee business, the change in mark-to-market gains / (losses) from derivatives decreased operating
income by $84 million in the first nine months of 2016. In the first nine months of 2016, the net unrealized losses on commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives were $49 million, as compared to net unrealized gains of $35 million
($75 million including coffee related activity) in the first nine months of 2015.    Unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $132 million, due
primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the British pound sterling, Argentinean peso and Brazilian real.    Operating
income margin decreased from 42.4% in the first nine months of 2015, to 10.8% in the first nine months of 2016. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by last year s pre-tax gain on the JDE coffee business transactions,
the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, divestiture-related costs associated with the planned sale of a confectionery
business in France, the change in mark-to-market gains/losses from derivatives, the reclassification of equity method earnings and intangible asset impairment charges. The items that decreased our operating income margin were partially offset by the
absence of costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions and an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 13.0% in the first nine months of 2015 to 15.6% in the first nine months
of 2016. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by lower overheads from cost reduction programs, improved gross margin reflecting productivity efforts, gains on sales of property and VAT-related settlements.

  Results of Operations by Reportable Segment     Our operations and management
structure are organized into five reportable operating segments:  

Latin America    

Asia Pacific    

EEMEA    

Europe    

North America      On October 1, 2016, we integrated our EEMEA business into our Europe and Asia Pacific segments.
Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined within our Europe operating segment, while the remaining Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific operating segment to form a new Asia, Middle East
and Africa ( AMEA ) regional operating segment.    We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing
business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.  
 Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments were part of our base business. Beginning in the
third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for our new coffee equity method investment in JDE, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of segment operating income.
Within segment operating income, equity method investment net earnings were $56 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, including $49 million in Asia Pacific, $3 million in EEMEA and $4 million in North America. See Note 1,
 Basis of Presentation   Principles of Consolidation,  and Note 2,  Divestitures and Acquisitions  for additional information.    We use segment
operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. See Note 15,  Segment Reporting,  for additional

    Latin America        
     Three Months Ended September 30:    
 Net revenues decreased $365 million (29.6%), due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations (24.2 pp), unfavorable currency (8.3 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix
(7.1 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (10.0 pp). The deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $315 million. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of
the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Argentinean peso and Mexican peso, partially offset by the strength of the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar. Unfavorable volume/mix, which primarily occurred in
Brazil and Argentina, was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in biscuits, refreshment beverages, chocolate
and gum. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories driven primarily by Argentina and Brazil.    Segment operating income decreased $42 million (31.3%),
primarily due to higher raw material costs, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency and higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. These unfavorable items were partially
offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including $34 million of VAT-related settlements), lower advertising and consumer promotions costs and lower manufacturing costs.  
   Nine Months Ended September 30:      Net revenues decreased $1,202
million (32.2%), due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations (19.5 pp), unfavorable currency (17.8 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (5.8 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (10.9 pp). The deconsolidation of our Venezuelan
operations resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $834 million. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian
real and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume/mix, which primarily occurred in Brazil and Argentina, was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable
volume/mix was driven by declines in refreshment beverages, chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories driven primarily by Argentina and Brazil.  
 Segment operating income decreased $231 million (54.7%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, unfavorable
volume/mix and unfavorable currency. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including $34 million of VAT-related settlements), lower manufacturing costs, lower
advertising and consumer promotion costs and the absence of remeasurement losses in the first nine months of 2016 related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela.

     Three Months Ended September 30:    
 Net revenues increased $27 million (2.5%), due to favorable volume/mix (2.0 pp) and favorable currency (1.0 pp), partially offset by lower net pricing (0.5 pp).
Favorable volume/mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, and refreshments beverages, partially offset by declines in cheese  
grocery, candy and gum. Favorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the Australian dollar and Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Chinese yuan and Indian
rupee. Lower net pricing was driven by chocolate, gum and refreshment beverages, partially offset by higher net pricing in candy and biscuits.    Segment operating
income increased $64 million (90.1%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and lower advertising and consumer promotion
costs. These favorable items were partially offset by lower net pricing and higher raw material costs.      Nine Months Ended September 30:    
 Net revenues were flat to the prior year, due to the impact of an acquisition (2.1 pp), favorable volume/mix (1.6 pp) and higher net pricing (0.6 pp), offset by
unfavorable currency (3.3 pp) and the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (1.0 pp). The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam in July 2015 added net revenues of $71 million. Favorable volume/mix, including
the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits, gum and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in candy and cheese   grocery. Higher net
pricing was driven by chocolate, candy, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by lower net pricing in gum. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region,
including the Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Australian dollar, partially offset by the strength of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease
in net revenues of $33 million.    Segment operating income increased $57 million (17.8%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general
and administrative expenses, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and the impact of the Vietnam acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by the reclassification of
equity method investment earnings, higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency and the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business and the impact of divestitures.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 We believe that cash from operations, our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our
working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. We continue to utilize our commercial paper program, international credit lines and long-term
debt issuances for regular funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material
effect on our liquidity, including the indefinite reinvestment of our earnings outside of the United States.     Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities:   
 Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,138 million in the first nine months of 2016 and $1,412 million in the first nine months of 2015. The deconsolidation of
our coffee businesses impacted our operating cash flows, as well as higher contributions related to our pension benefit plans in 2016 to date, including discretionary contributions of $250 million in 2016 and $200 million in 2015. After converting
our coffee holdings into equity method investments, we will only recognize cash flows from coffee when the investments pay dividends. We received $4 million of dividends from our investment in Keurig in the first nine months of 2016. Our coffee
investment in JDE did not distribute dividends in the first nine months of 2016.     Net Cash (Used in) / Provided by Investing Activities:   
 Net cash used in investing activities was $521 million in the first nine months of 2016 and net cash provided by investing activities was $3,460 million in the first
nine months of 2015. In the first nine months of 2015, we received $4.1 billion of cash, net of transaction costs, from the deconsolidation of our coffee business and the divestiture of AGF and $1.1 billion of cash related to the settlement of
currency exchange forward contracts related to our JDE coffee business transactions. This was partially offset by $536 million of payments to acquire a biscuit operation in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods in 2015, lower planned capital expenditures in
2016 and $73 million of proceeds from the sales of property in 2016.    Capital expenditures were $909 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
$1,178 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2016 capital expenditures to
be up to $1.4 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations.  
  Net Cash Used In Financing Activities:     Net cash used in financing activities
was $830 million in the first nine months of 2016 and $4,270 million in the first nine months of 2015. Cash flows used in financing activities were lower due to higher short-term financing to fund working capital requirements, lower share
repurchases in 2016 to date and lower net repayments of long-term debt due to the decision to refinance maturing debt in 2016 to date than in the first nine months of 2015.  
  Debt:     From time to time we refinance long-term and short-term
debt. Refer to Note 7,  Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for details of our debt issuances and maturities during the first nine months of 2016 and for the subsequent debt activity in October 2016. The nature and amount of our long-term
and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Generally, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital
requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The third and fourth quarters of the year typically generate higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to
meet short-term working capital needs.    In July 2015, our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion long-term financing authority. As of September 30, 2016, we
had $2.8 billion of long-term financing authority remaining.    Following our most recent October 2016 debt activity, in the next 12 months, we expect $1.5 billion of
long-term debt will mature as follows:    750 million ($843 million as of September 30, 2016) in January 2017,  fr. 175 million Swiss franc notes ($180 million as of
September 30, 2016) in March 2017 and $488 million in August 2017. We expect to fund these repayments with a combination of cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or long-term debt.  
 Our total debt was $17.1 billion at September 30, 2016 and $15.4 billion at December 31, 2015. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.38 at September 30,
2016 and 0.35 at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 8.4 years. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and $2.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We expect to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 7,  Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for more information on our debt and debt covenants.

   Commodity Trends     We regularly
monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the primary drivers of the increase in our
aggregate commodity costs were higher currency-related costs on our commodity purchases and increased costs for packaging and other raw materials, partially offset by lower costs for dairy, nuts, grains and oils, energy, sugar and cocoa.  
 A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other
programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control.
We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in
specific raw material costs. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.  
 We expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2016. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe
there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources.     Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations     See Note 7,  Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for information on debt transactions during the first
nine months of 2016 and subsequent debt activity in October 2016, February 9, 2016 refinancing and repayment of $1,750 million of matured U.S. dollar debt, the January 26, 2016 issuance of  fr .400 million of Swiss franc notes
and the January 21, 2016 issuance of    700 million of euro notes. There were no other material changes to our off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We also do not expect a material change in the effect these arrangements and obligations will have on our liquidity. See Note 11,  Commitments and
Contingencies , for a discussion of guarantees.     Equity and Dividends   
  Stock Plans and Share Repurchases:       See Note 10,  Stock Plans ,
for more information on our stock plans, grant activity and share repurchase program for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.       We intend to
continue to use a portion of our cash for share repurchases. On July 29, 2015, our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the
authorization to $13.7 billion of Common Stock repurchases, and extended the program through December 31, 2018. We repurchased $10.0 billion of shares ($1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2016, $3.6 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014
and $2.7 billion in 2013) through September 30, 2016. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing
capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any
particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice.     Dividends:   
 We paid dividends of $801 million in the first nine months of 2016 and $736 million in the first nine months of 2015. On July 19, 2016, our Board of Directors
approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.19 per common share or $0.76 per common share on an annual basis. On July 23, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 13% increase at that time in the quarterly dividend to $0.17 per
common share or $0.68 per common share on an annual basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future
prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making. We will make a determination as to whether 2016 distributions are taxable as dividends, a return of basis or both under U.S. federal income
tax rules after the 2016 calendar year-end. This determination will be reflected on an IRS Form 1099-DIV issued in early 2017.

   Non-GAAP Financial Measures     We
use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional
insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP
definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition   divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant
currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP
financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results throughout our  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations  in this Form 10-Q.    Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year

on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees 
unusual or infrequent items, such as acquisition and divestiture-related costs and restructuring program costs. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis  (3) .

 Divestitures include completed sales of businesses and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement.

 In connection with the JDE coffee business transactions that closed on July 2, 2015, because we exchanged our coffee interests for similarly-sized coffee interests in JDE at the time of the transaction, we have
deconsolidated and not included our historical global coffee business results within divestitures in our non-GAAP financial measures and in the related  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations . We continue to have an ongoing interest in the coffee business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, we have included the after-tax earnings of JDE, Keurig and of our historical coffee business results within continuing results of
operations. For Adjusted EPS, we have included these earnings in equity method investment earnings and have deconsolidated our historical coffee business results from Organic Net Revenue and Adjusted Operating Income to facilitate comparisons of
past and future coffee operating results.

 Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial
statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.

 Refer to Note 2,  Divestitures and Acquisitions   Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group , to the consolidated financial statements in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more information on
Spin-Off Costs incurred in connection with the October 1, 2012 spin-off of the Kraft Foods Group grocery business.    

(5) 
 Non-GAAP adjustments related to the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do
not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments.    

(6) 
 During the third quarter of 2016, we began to exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives from our non-GAAP earnings measures
until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we made this
adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. On a prospective basis, we will discontinue designating commodity
and forecasted currency transaction derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. To facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating results, we have recast all historical non-GAAP earnings measures to exclude the mark-to-market impacts.

(7) 
 Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, we began to
record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income following the deconsolidation of our coffee business. See Note 1,  Basis of Presentation   Principles of
Consolidation , for more information. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method earnings from our Adjusted Operating Income to after-tax equity method investment earnings within Adjusted EPS to be consistent
with the deconsolidation of our coffee business results on July 2, 2015 and in order to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis.      We
believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete
understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures
is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and
carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q.     Organic Net Revenue:
    Applying the definition of  Organic Net Revenue , the adjustments made to  net revenues  (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure)
were to exclude the impact of currency, the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, our historical Venezuelan operations, an accounting calendar change and acquisitions. We believe that Organic Net Revenue reflects the
underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. We also evaluate our Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and Power Brands, and these underlying measures are also reconciled
to U.S. GAAP below.

     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   
 As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as
part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results.
We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative
activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 8,  Financial Instruments .  
 Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported
results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of
our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects
our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and
other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See  Consolidated Results of Operations  and  Results of Operations by
Reportable Segment  under  Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results  for currency exchange effects on our financial results during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. For additional information on the impact of currency
policies, the recent U.K. referendum to exit the E.U., recent currency devaluations, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operation and the historical remeasurement of our Venezuelan net monetary assets on our financial condition and results of
operations, also see Note 1,  Basis of Presentation   Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting .   We also continually monitor the market for
commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions. To manage the input cost volatility, we enter into forward
purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings. 
 We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary
exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, London Interbank Offered Rates ( LIBOR ), Euro Interbank Offered Rate ( EURIBOR ) and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps
and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. In addition to using interest rate derivatives to manage future interest payments, in the first
quarter of 2016, we retired $1.8 billion of our long-term debt and issued $1.2 billion of lower borrowing cost debt. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of September 30, 2016 was 3.1%, down from 3.7% as of December 31,
2015.    There were no significant changes in the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our exposures between December 31, 2015 and September 30,
2016. See Note 8,  Financial Instruments , for more information on 2016 derivative activity. For additional information on our hedging strategies, policies and practices on an ongoing basis, also refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015.

     Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     We have established
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the SEC, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.     Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
 Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.
During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we worked with outsourced partners to further simplify and standardize processes and focus on scalable, transactional processes across all regions. We continued to migrate some of our procurement
administration functions for the EEMEA, Europe and Asia Pacific regions to an outsourced partner. Additionally, we continued to transition some of our transactional processing and financial reporting for a number of countries in all regions
(including order-to-cash in our Europe and Latin America regions) to three outsourced partners. Pursuant to our service agreements, the controls previously established around these accounting functions will be maintained by our outsourced
partners, and they are subject to management s internal control testing. During the quarter, we also transitioned some of our human resources data processing performed in country and marketing procurement administration processes to our
internal shared service centers in the Asia Pacific and Europe regions. Additionally, we successfully transitioned the Argentina, Uruguay and Chile entities onto our accounting system. There were no other changes in our internal control over
financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
