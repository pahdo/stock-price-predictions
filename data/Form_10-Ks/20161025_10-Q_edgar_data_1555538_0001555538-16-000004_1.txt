  1. General    
  Description of Business  
  SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P., (the "Partnership", "we", "our", and "us"), is a Delaware limited partnership formed in     July 2012  , which primarily produces coke used in the blast furnace production of steel.    At   September 30, 2016  , we owned a   98 percent     interest in Haverhill Coke Company LLC ("Haverhill"), Middletown Coke Company, LLC ("Middletown") and Gateway Energy and Coke Company, LLC ("Granite City").    The remaining   2 percent   ownership interest in our   three   cokemaking facilities was owned by SunCoke Energy, Inc. ("SunCoke").  We also own a Coal Logistics business, which provides coal handling and/or mixing services to third-party customers as well as to our own cokemaking facilities and other SunCoke cokemaking facilities.  Our Coal Logistics business consists of Convent Marine Terminal ("CMT"), Kanawha River Terminals, LLC ("KRT") and SunCoke Lake Terminal, LLC ("Lake Terminal").  At   September 30, 2016  , SunCoke, through a subsidiary, owned a   53.9 percent   limited partnership interest in us and indirectly owned and controlled our general partner, which holds a   2.0 percent   general partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights ("IDR"). 
  Incorporated in Delaware in 2012 and headquartered in Lisle, Illinois, we became a publicly-traded partnership in 2013 and our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the symbol  SXCP.  
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited combined and consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim reporting.  Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  In management s opinion, the financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the periods presented.  The results of operations for the period ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.  These unaudited interim combined and consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the audited combined and consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The combined and consolidated financial statements for the periods presented pertain to the operations of the Partnership and give retrospective effect to include the results of operations and cash flows of Granite City (the "Previous Owner"), as a result of the January 2015 dropdown of a   75 percent   interest in Granite City ("Granite City Dropdown"). 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)." ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months.  It is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The Partnership is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its potential impact on the Partnership's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605),  and requires entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting revenue gross versus net),  which clarifies gross versus net revenue reporting when another party is involved in the transaction. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  which amends the revenue guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.    In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients," which provides narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectibility, non-cash consideration, and completed contracts at transition.  The standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and permits early adoption on a limited basis.  The Partnership is currently evaluating the new standard to determine its potential impact on the Partnership's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.     
  Reclassifications 
    Certain amounts in the prior period combined and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

2. Related Party Transactions and Agreements    
  Transactions with Affiliate  
    Our Coal Logistics business provides coal handling and mixing services to certain SunCoke cokemaking operations.  Coal Logistics recorded revenues derived from services provided to SunCoke s cokemaking operations of   $2.5 million   and   $7.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $4.0 million   and   $10.3 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.    Additionally, Domestic Coke purchased coal from SunCoke and its affiliates totaling   $1.6 million   and   $3.8 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $1.3 million   and   $3.9 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
    Our Coal Logistics business also provides coal handling and storage services to Murray American Coal ("Murray") and Foresight Energy LP ("Foresight"), who are related parties with The Cline Group.  The Cline Group currently owns a   10.3 percent   interest in the Partnership, acquired as part of the CMT acquisition.  Additionally, Murray also holds a significant interest in Foresight.  Sales to Murray and Foresight accounted for   $4.6 million  , or   2.5 percent  , and   $15.0 million   or   2.7 percent   of the Partnership's sales and other operating revenue and were recorded in the Coal Logistics segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Coal Logistics recorded revenues derived from services provided to these related parties of   $4.4 million  .  At   September 30, 2016  , receivables from Murray and Foresight were   $11.6 million  , which were recorded in receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and deferred revenue for minimum volume shortfall payments was   $25.7 million  , which was recorded in deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Deferred revenue on these take-or-pay contracts is billed quarterly, but recognized into income at the earlier of when service is provided or annually based on the terms of the contract.  At December 31, 2015, receivables from Murray and Foresight were   $7.2 million  , which were recorded in receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and there were no deferred revenues for minimum volume shortfall payments from these customers. 
   In connection with the acquisition of CMT, the Partnership assumed Raven Energy LLC's promissory note ("Promissory Note") of   $114.9 million   with a subsidiary of The Cline Group as the lender.  See   Note 7  .  Additionally, as part of the acquisition of CMT, the Partnership entered into a contingent consideration agreement with The Cline Group.  See   Note 10  . 
  Also as part of the CMT acquisition, the Partnership withheld   $21.5 million   in cash to fund the completion of capital improvements at CMT.  The cash withheld was recorded as restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  During the first quarter of 2016, the Partnership amended an agreement with the Cline Group, which unrestricted   $6.0 million   of the restricted cash and relieved any obligation of the Partnership to repay these amounts to The Cline Group.  The remaining restricted cash balance as of   September 30, 2016   of   $0.7 million   is primarily related to the completion of the installation of the new state-of-the-art ship loader, which is expected to be placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2016 and will allow for faster coal loading onto larger ships.   
  Allocated Expenses 
  SunCoke charges us for all direct costs and expenses incurred on our behalf and allocated costs associated with support services provided to our operations.  Allocated expenses from SunCoke for general corporate and operations support costs totaled   $6.5 million   and   $20.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $6.5 million   and   $19.8 million   during   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, and were included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Income.  These costs include legal, accounting, tax, treasury, engineering, information technology, insurance, employee benefit costs, communications, human resources, and procurement. Corporate allocations are recorded in accordance with the terms of our omnibus agreement with SunCoke and our general partner.  These allocations were increased in the first quarter of 2016 for additional support provided to the CMT operations.  
    In the first half of 2016, SunCoke took certain actions to support the Partnership's strategy to de-lever its balance sheet and maintain a solid liquidity position.  During the first quarter of 2016, SunCoke provided a "reimbursement holiday" on the   $7.0 million     of corporate costs allocated to the Partnership and also returned its   $1.4 million   IDR cash distribution to the Partnership ("IDR giveback"), resulting in capital contributions of   $8.4 million  .    During the second quarter of 2016, SunCoke provided the Partnership with deferred payment terms until April 2017 on the reimbursement of the   $6.9 million   of allocated corporate costs to the Partnership and the   $1.4 million   IDR cash distribution, resulting in an outstanding payable to SunCoke of   $8.3 million     included in payable to affiliate, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016  .     
    At   September 30, 2016  , net payables to SunCoke and affiliates were   $6.2 million  , which were recorded in payable to affiliates, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.    At December 31, 2015, net receivables from SunCoke and affiliates were   $1.4 million  , which were recorded in receivable from affiliates, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

     Table of Contents  

Omnibus Agreement 
  In connection with the closing of our initial public offering on   January 24, 2013   ("IPO"), we entered into an omnibus agreement with SunCoke and our general partner that addresses certain aspects of our relationship with them, including:  
  Business Opportunities.    We have preferential rights to invest in, acquire and construct cokemaking facilities in the United States and Canada.  SunCoke has preferential rights to all other business opportunities.  
  Potential Defaults by Coke Agreement Counterparties.   For a period of   five   years from the closing date of the IPO, SunCoke has agreed to make us whole (including an obligation to pay for coke) to the extent (i) AK Steel exercises the early termination right provided in its Haverhill coke sales agreement, (ii) any customer fails to purchase coke or defaults in payment under its coke sales agreement (other than by reason of force majeure or our default) or (iii) we amend a coke sales agreement's terms to reduce a customer's purchase obligation as a result of the customer's financial distress.  We and SunCoke will share in any damages and other amounts recovered from third-parties arising from such events in proportion to our relative losses.  
  Environmental Indemnity.   SunCoke will indemnify us to the full extent of any remediation losses at the Haverhill and Middletown cokemaking facilities arising from any environmental matter discovered and identified as requiring remediation prior to the closing of the IPO.  In addition, SunCoke will indemnify us for remediation losses at the Granite City cokemaking facility arising from any environmental matter discovered and identified as requiring remediation prior to the closing of the initial Granite City Dropdown.  SunCoke contributed   $67.0 million   in partial satisfaction of this obligation from the proceeds of the IPO, and an additional   $52.0 million   in connection with subsequent dropdowns.  If, prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing of the IPO, a pre-existing environmental matter is identified as requiring remediation, SunCoke will indemnify us for up to   $50.0 million   of any such remediation costs (we will bear the first   $5.0 million   of any such costs). 
  Other Indemnification.    SunCoke will fully indemnify us with respect to any additional tax liability related to periods prior to or in connection with the closing of the IPO or the Granite City Dropdown to the extent not currently presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Additionally, SunCoke will either cure or fully indemnify us for losses resulting from any material title defects at the properties owned by the entities acquired in connection with the closing of the IPO or the Granite City Dropdown to the extent that those defects interfere with or could reasonably be expected to interfere with the operations of the related cokemaking facilities.  We will indemnify SunCoke for events relating to our operations except to the extent that we are entitled to indemnification by SunCoke.   
  License.   SunCoke has granted us a royalty-free license to use the name  SunCoke  and related marks.  Additionally, SunCoke has granted us a non-exclusive right to use all of SunCoke's current and future cokemaking and related technology.  We have not paid and will not pay a separate license fee for the rights we receive under the license.  
  Expenses and Reimbursement.   SunCoke will continue to provide us with certain corporate and other services, and we will reimburse SunCoke for all direct costs and expenses incurred on our behalf and a portion of corporate and other costs and expenses attributable to our operations.  SunCoke may consider providing additional support to the Partnership in the future by providing a corporate cost reimbursement holiday, whereby the Partnership would not be required to reimburse SunCoke for costs or a deferral, whereby the Partnership would be granted extended payment terms.  Additionally, we have agreed to pay all fees in connection with any future financing arrangement entered into for the purpose of replacing the credit facility or the senior notes.  
  So long as SunCoke controls our general partner, the omnibus agreement will remain in full force and effect unless mutually terminated by the parties.  If SunCoke ceases to control our general partner, the omnibus agreement will terminate, but our rights to indemnification and use of SunCoke's existing cokemaking and related technology will survive.  The omnibus agreement can be amended by written agreement of all parties to the agreement, but we may not agree to any amendment that would, in the reasonable discretion of our general partner, be adverse in any material respect to the holders of our common units without prior approval of the conflicts committee.  
   
  3. Cash Distributions and Net Income Per Unit 
  Cash Distributions 
  Our partnership agreement generally provides that we will make cash distributions, if any, each quarter in the following manner: 
             
    first  ,   98 percent   to the holders of common units and   2 percent   to our general partner, until each common unit has received the minimum quarterly distribution of   $0.412500   plus any arrearages from prior quarters; 
                
    second,     98 percent   to the holders of subordinated units and   2 percent   to our general partner, until each subordinated unit has received the minimum quarterly distribution of   $0.412500  ; and 

7 

     Table of Contents  

third,     98 percent   to all unitholders, pro rata, and   2 percent   to our general partner, until each unit has received a distribution of   $0.474375  . 
     If cash distributions to our unitholders exceed   $0.474375   per unit in any quarter, our unitholders and our general partner will receive distributions according to the following percentage allocations: 

Our distributions are declared subsequent to quarter end.  The table below represents total cash distributions applicable to the period in which the distributions were earned: 

(1) SunCoke provided the Partnership with deferred payment terms until April 2017 on the   $1.4 million   IDR cash distribution earned in the first quarter of 2016.  The total cash disbursed from the distribution on   June 1, 2016   was   $28.0 million  .  
  (2) On   October 18, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of   $0.5940   per unit, which will be paid on   December 1, 2016  , to unitholders of record on   November 15, 2016  . 
  Allocation of Net Income 
  Our partnership agreement contains provisions for the allocation of net income to the unitholders and the general partner.  For purposes of maintaining partner capital accounts, the partnership agreement specifies that items of income and loss shall be allocated among the partners in accordance with their respective percentage interest. Normal allocations according to percentage interests are made after giving effect, if any, to priority income allocations in an amount equal to incentive cash distributions allocated   100 percent   to the general partner.  Net income from Granite City s operations prior to the Granite City Dropdown is allocated to the general partner.  
  Upon payment of the cash distribution for the fourth quarter of 2015, the financial requirements for the conversion of all subordinated units were satisfied.  As a result, the   15,709,697   subordinated units converted into common units on a one-for-one basis.  For purpose of calculating net income per unit, the conversion of the subordinated units is deemed to have occurred on January 1, 2016.  The conversion did not impact the amount of the cash distribution paid or the total number of the Partnership's outstanding units representing limited partner interest.

     Table of Contents  

The calculation of net income allocated to the general and limited partners was as follows:   

  (1)  Per the amended Partnership agreement, expenses paid on behalf of the Partnership are to be allocated entirely to the partner who paid them.  During the   first quarter of 2016  , SunCoke paid   $7.0 million   of allocated corporate costs on behalf of the Partnership and will not seek reimbursement for those costs.  See   Note 2  .  These expenses are recorded as a direct reduction to SunCoke's interest in net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Earnings Per Unit 
  Our net income is allocated to the general partner and limited partners in accordance with their respective partnership percentages, after giving effect to priority income allocations for incentive distributions, if any, to our general partner, pursuant to our partnership agreement.  Distributions less than or greater than earnings are allocated in accordance with our partnership agreement.  Payments made to our unitholders are determined in relation to actual distributions declared and are not based on the net income allocations used in the calculation of net income per unit. 
  In addition to the common and subordinated units, we also have identified the general partner interest and IDRs as participating securities and we use the two-class method when calculating the net income per unit applicable to limited partners, which is based on the weighted-average number of common units outstanding during the period.  Basic and diluted net income per unit applicable to limited partners are the same because we do not have any potentially dilutive units outstanding.  In 2015, the Partnership early adopted ASU 2015-06, "Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)."  Therefore, the Granite City Dropdown does not impact historical earnings per unit as the earnings of Granite City prior to the Granite City Dropdown were allocated entirely to our general partner.

    Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, is tested for impairment as of October 1 of each year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to below its carrying value.  Goodwill allocated to the Partnership's reportable segments as of   September 30, 2016   and changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     were as follows:

    In the first quarter of 2016, a working capital adjustment to the acquisition date fair value of the acquired net assets decreased the amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill by   $0.6 million  .      
     (2)	In the third quarter of 2016, an adjustment to the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration liability increased the amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill by   $6.4 million  .  
  The components of intangible assets were as follows:   

  Total amortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization was   $2.6 million   and   $8.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $1.3 million   and   $1.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
   
  6. Income Taxes 
  The Partnership is a limited partnership and generally is not subject to federal income taxes.  However, as part of the Granite City Dropdown in the first quarter of 2015, the Partnership acquired an interest in Gateway Cogeneration Company, LLC, which is subject to income taxes for federal and state purposes.  Additionally, as a result of the Granite City Dropdown, the Partnership is subject to state income tax.  Earnings from our Middletown operations are subject to a local income tax.

     Table of Contents  

The Partnership recorded income tax expense of   $0.4 million   and   $1.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to income tax expense of   $0.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   and income tax benefit of   $2.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The   nine months ended September 30, 2015   included an income tax benefit of   $4.0 million   related to the tax impacts of the Granite City Dropdown.  Earnings from our Granite City operations include federal and state income taxes calculated on a theoretical separate-return basis until the date of the Granite City Dropdown on   January 13, 2015  . 
    The Internal Revenue Service has commenced an audit on the Partnership's 2013 tax return.  Although no assurance can be given, the Partnership does not anticipate any material changes in prior year taxable income as a result of the audit. 
   
  7. Debt and Financing Obligation 
  Total debt and financing obligation, including the current portion of long-term debt and financing obligation, consisted of the following:   

  Partnership Notes     
    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership continued de-levering its balance sheet and repurchased   $84.4 million   face value of outstanding Partnership Notes for   $60.0 million   of cash payments.  This resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $24.9 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , which included the write-off of   $0.5 million   of unamortized original issue premium, net of unamortized debt issuance costs.     
  Partnership Revolver 
    The Partnership repaid   $5.0 million   on the Partnership Revolver during the third quarter of 2016   and at   September 30, 2016   had   $1.5 million   of letters of credit outstanding and an outstanding balance of   $177.0 million  ,   leaving   $71.5 million     available.    Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , on October 4, 2016, the Partnership repaid an additional     $5.0 million   on the Partnership Revolver.      
  Financing Obligation 
    On   July 22, 2016  , the Partnership entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement of certain integral equipment from the Domestic Coke segment and certain mobile equipment from the Coal Logistics segment for total proceeds of   $16.2 million  . The leaseback agreement has an initial lease period of   60 months  , with an early buyout option after   48 months   to purchase the equipment at   34.5 percent   of the original lease equipment cost. Under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 840 "Leases", the early buyout option results in a form of continuing involvement by the Partnership, and therefore the arrangement is accounted for as a financing transaction.    The Partnership repaid   $0.5 million   of the financing obligation during the third quarter of 2016.    Annual future minimum lease payments are approximately   $2.5 million   to   $3.0 million   through   2019   and   $7.3 million   in   2020  , which includes the early buyout option payment.    
  Covenants 
    The Partnership is subject to certain debt covenants that, among other things, limit the Partnership s ability, and the ability of certain of the Partnership s subsidiaries, to (i) incur indebtedness, (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions, (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt, (iv) make loans and investments, (v) sell assets, (vi) incur liens, (vii) enter into  

12 

     Table of Contents  

transactions with affiliates and (viii) consolidate or merge.  These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications set forth in the respective agreements governing the Partnership's debt.    
    Under the terms of the Partnership Revolver,   the Partnership is subject to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of   4.50  :  1.00  , calculated by dividing total debt by EBITDA as defined by the Partnership Revolver, and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of   2.50  :  1.00  , calculated by dividing EBITDA by interest expense as defined by the Partnership Revolver.    
  Under the terms of the promissory agreement, Raven Energy LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, is subject to a maximum leverage ratio of   5.00  :  1.00   for any fiscal quarter ending prior to August 12, 2018, calculated by dividing total debt by EBITDA as defined by the promissory agreement.  For any fiscal quarter ending on or after August 12, 2018, the maximum leverage ratio is   4.50  :  1.00  .  Additionally in order to make restricted payments, Raven Energy LLC is subject to a fixed charge ratio of greater than   1.00  :  1.00  ,   calculated by dividing EBITDA by fixed charges as defined by the promissory agreement.    
  If we fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the lenders' credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, under the Partnership Revolver could be declared immediately due and payable.  The Partnership has a cross-default provision that applies to our indebtedness having a principal amount in excess of   $20 million  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership was in compliance with all applicable debt covenants contained in the Partnership Revolver and promissory agreement.  We do not anticipate violation of these covenants nor do we anticipate that any of these covenants will restrict our operations or our ability to obtain additional financing.   
   
  8. Supplemental Cash Flow Information 
  Significant non-cash activities were as follows:   

9. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") has issued Notices of Violations ( NOVs ) for the Haverhill and Granite City cokemaking facilities which stem from alleged violations of air operating permits for these facilities.  We are working in a cooperative manner with the EPA, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to address the allegations, and have entered into a consent degree in federal district court with these parties.  The consent decree includes a   $2.2 million   civil penalty payment that was paid by SunCoke in December 2014, as well as capital projects already underway to improve the reliability of the energy recovery systems and enhance environmental performance at the Haverhill and Granite City cokemaking facilities.      
  We retained an aggregate of   $119 million   in proceeds from the IPO, the dropdown of Haverhill and Middletown and the Granite City Dropdown to fund these environmental remediation projects at the Haverhill and Granite City cokemaking facilities.  Pursuant to the omnibus agreement, any amounts that we spend on these projects in excess of the   $119 million   will be reimbursed by SunCoke.  Prior to our formation, SunCoke spent   $7 million   related to these projects. We have spent approximately   $85 million   to date and the remaining capital is expected to be spent through the first quarter of   2019  . 
  The Partnership is a party to certain other pending and threatened claims, including matters related to commercial and tax disputes, product liability, employment claims, personal injury claims, premises-liability claims, allegations of exposures to toxic substances and general environmental claims.  Although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be ascertained at this time, it is reasonably possible that some portion of these claims could be resolved unfavorably to the Partnership.  Management of the Partnership believes that any liability which may arise from claims would not have a material adverse impact on our combined and consolidated financial statements.  
   
  10. Fair Value Measurements 

13 

     Table of Contents  

The Partnership measures certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis.  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  Fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy, maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. 
  The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date.  The three levels are defined as follows: 
             
    Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market. 
                
    Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
                
    Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. 
     Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  
  Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  The Partnership s cash equivalents are measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.  These inputs are classified as Level 1 within the valuation hierarchy.  The Partnership had   $0.1 million   of cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016  .  
  Convent Marine Terminal Contingent Consideration 
  In connection with the CMT acquisition, the Partnership entered into a contingent consideration arrangement that requires us to make future payments to The Cline Group based on future volume over a specified threshold, price, and contract renewals.    The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated based on a probability-weighted analysis using significant inputs that are not observable in the market, or Level 3 inputs.  Key assumptions included probability adjusted levels of coal handling services provided by CMT, anticipated price per ton on future sales and probability of contract renewal, including length of future contracts, volume commitment, and anticipated price per ton.  The fair value of the contingent consideration at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $6.0 million   and   $7.9 million  , and was included in other deferred charges and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.    During the third quarter of 2016, the Partnership recorded an adjustment to the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration liability, which increased the liability and goodwill by   $6.4 million  .    During the first quarter of 2016, the Partnership amended the contingent consideration terms with The Cline Group.    These amended terms   and subsequent fair value adjustments   to the contingent consideration decreased costs of products sold and operating expenses on the Combined and Consolidated Statement of Income by   $4.6 million   and   $8.3 million   during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.     
  Deferred Compensation     
    The Partnership offers its Board of Directors the opportunity to defer their unit-based compensation. The Partnership measures the fair value of the deferred compensation on a quarterly basis using the Partnership's closing unit price as of the end of the period,   or Level 1 inputs.  The fair value of the Board of Directors deferred compensation was   $1.3 million   and     $0.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and was included in other deferred credits and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value adjustments increased selling, general and administrative expenses by   $0.4 million   and   $0.7 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively and decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.    
  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of the Partnership's total debt was   $792.5 million   compared to a carrying amount of $  824.3 million  .  The fair value was estimated by management based upon estimates of debt pricing provided by financial institutions which are considered Level 2 inputs.

11. Business Segment Disclosures 
  The Partnership derives its revenues from the Domestic Coke and Coal Logistics reportable segments. Domestic Coke operations are comprised of the Haverhill and Middletown cokemaking facilities located in Ohio and the Granite City cokemaking facility located in Illinois. These facilities use similar production processes to produce coke and to recover waste heat that is converted to steam or electricity. Steam is provided to third-party customers primarily pursuant to steam supply and purchase agreements. Electricity is sold into the regional power market or to AK Steel pursuant to energy sales agreements. Coke sales at the Partnership's cokemaking facilities are made pursuant to long-term, take-or-pay agreements with ArcelorMittal, AK Steel and U.S. Steel. Each of the coke sales agreements contain pass-through provisions for costs incurred in the cokemaking process, including coal procurement costs (subject to meeting contractual coal-to-coke yields), operating and maintenance expenses, costs related to the transportation of coke to the customers, taxes (other than income taxes) and costs associated with changes in regulation, in addition to containing a fixed fee. 
  Coal Logistics operations are comprised of CMT located in Louisiana, Lake Terminal located in Indiana and KRT located in West Virginia. This business has a collective capacity to mix and transload approximately   35 million   tons of coal annually and provides coal handling and/or mixing services to third-party customers as well as our own cokemaking facilities and other SunCoke cokemaking facilities. Coal handling and mixing results are presented in the Coal Logistics segment.  
  Corporate and other expenses that can be identified with a segment have been included in determining segment results. The remainder is included in Corporate and Other. Interest expense, net and (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt are also excluded from segment results. Segment assets are those assets that are utilized within a specific segment. 
  The following table includes Adjusted EBITDA, which is the measure of segment profit or loss and liquidity reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance: 

(1)  The   Partnership revised the estimated useful lives of certain assets in its Coal Logistics segment, which resulted in additional depreciation of   $2.2 million  , or   $0.05   per common unit, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

The following table sets forth the Partnership s total sales and other operating revenue by product or service, excluding intersegment revenues: 

The following table sets forth the Partnership's segment assets: 

The Partnership evaluates the performance of its segments based on segment Adjusted EBITDA, which     represents earnings before interest, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for   Coal Logistics changes to our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of the CMT and the expiration of certain acquired contractual obligations.    Adjusted EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net income or operating income under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses.      
  Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of the operating performance and liquidity of the Partnership's net assets and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions.  Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and liquidity.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.    Set forth below is additional discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool.     
  Limitations.     Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.  Adjusted EBITDA also has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include that Adjusted EBITDA:    
             
    does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;     
                
    does not reflect items such as depreciation and amortization;     
                
    does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;    
                
    does not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest on or principal payments of our debt;    
                
    does not reflect certain other non-cash income and expenses;    
                
    excludes income taxes that may represent a reduction in available cash; and    
                
    includes net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited) to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, which are its most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP:       

           (1) 
    Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, in response to the SEC s May 2016 update to its guidance on the appropriate use of non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA no longer includes Coal Logistics deferred revenue until it is recognized as GAAP revenue.  
              (2) 
    The Partnership amended the contingent consideration terms with The Cline Group during the first quarter of 2016.  These amendments and subsequent fair value adjustments resulted in gains of   $4.6 million   and   $8.3 million   recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which were excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. 
              (3) 
    In association with the acquisition of CMT, we assumed certain performance obligations under existing contracts and recorded liabilities related to such obligations.  In third quarter of 2016, the final acquired contractual performance obligation expired without the customer requiring performance.  As such, the Partnership reversed the liability in the period as we no longer have any obligations under the contract.    
              (4) 
    Reflects net income attributable to our Granite City facility prior to the Granite City Dropdown on   January 13, 2015   adjusted for Granite City's share of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization during the same period.      
              (5) 
    Reflects net income attributable to noncontrolling interest adjusted for noncontrolling interest's share of interest, taxes, income, and depreciation and amortization.

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements of expected future developments, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and industry that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.  Our future results and financial condition may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under  Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.  
  This  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and certain other financial data that is prepared using non-GAAP measures.  For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP components, see  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  at the end of this Item. 
  These statements reflect significant assumptions and allocations and include all expenses allocable to our business, but may not be indicative of those that would have been achieved had we operated as a separate public entity for all periods presented or of future results.  
   
  Overview 
  SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P., (the "Partnership", "we", "our", and "us"), is a Delaware limited partnership formed in     July 2012  , which primarily produces coke used in the blast furnace production of steel.    At   September 30, 2016  , we owned a   98 percent     interest in Haverhill Coke Company LLC ("Haverhill"), Middletown Coke Company, LLC ("Middletown") and Gateway Energy and Coke Company, LLC ("Granite City").    The remaining   2 percent   ownership interest in our   three   cokemaking facilities was owned by SunCoke Energy, Inc. ("SunCoke").  We also own a Coal Logistics business, which provides coal handling and/or mixing services to third-party customers as well as to our own cokemaking facilities and other SunCoke cokemaking facilities.  Our Coal Logistics business consists of Convent Marine Terminal ("CMT"), Kanawha River Terminals, LLC ("KRT") and SunCoke Lake Terminal, LLC ("Lake Terminal").  At   September 30, 2016  , SunCoke, through a subsidiary, owned a   53.9 percent   limited partnership interest in us and indirectly owned and controlled our general partner, which holds a   2.0 percent   general partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights ("IDR"). 
  Our cokemaking ovens utilize efficient, modern heat recovery technology designed to combust the coal s volatile components liberated during the cokemaking process and use the resulting heat to create steam or electricity for sale.  This differs from by-product cokemaking, which re-purposes the coal s liberated volatile components for other uses.  We have constructed the only greenfield cokemaking facilities in the U.S. in the last 25 years and are the only North American coke producer that utilizes heat recovery technology in the cokemaking process.  We believe that heat recovery technology has several advantages over the alternative by-product cokemaking process, including producing higher quality coke, using waste heat to generate steam or electricity for sale and reducing the environmental impact. 
  All of our coke sales are made pursuant to long-term, take-or-pay agreements.  These coke sales agreements have an average remaining term of approximately   nine   years and contain pass-through provisions for costs we incur in the cokemaking process, including coal procurement costs (subject to meeting contractual coal-to-coke yields), operating and maintenance expenses, costs related to the transportation of coke to our customers, taxes (other than income taxes) and costs associated with changes in regulation.  The coke sales agreement and energy sales agreement with AK Steel at our Haverhill facility are subject to early termination by AK Steel under limited circumstances and provided that AK Steel has given at least two years prior notice of its intention to terminate the agreements and certain other conditions are met.  No other coke sales contract has an early termination clause.  For a five-year period following our initial public offering on January 24, 2013 ("IPO"), SunCoke has agreed to make us whole or purchase all of our coke production not taken by our customers in the event of a customer's default or exercise of certain termination rights, under the same terms as those provided for in the coke sales agreements with our customers. 
  Our core business model is predicated on providing steelmakers an alternative to investing capital in their own captive coke production facilities.  We direct our marketing efforts principally towards steelmaking customers that require coke for use in their blast furnaces.  Our steelmaking customers are currently operating in an environment that is challenged by global overcapacity and lower demand.  While steel pricing has rebounded in 2016, aided by favorable rulings from the Department of Commerce ("DOC") and the International Trade Commission ("ITC") on unfairly traded steel imports, as well as stabilized global supply and demand dynamics, our customers have kept certain facilities idled as they await further signs of market stability.  Despite these challenges, our customers continue to comply with the terms of their long-term, take-or-pay contracts with us. 
  Our Granite City facility and the first phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill 1, have steam generation facilities, which use hot flue gas from the cokemaking process to produce steam for sale to customers pursuant to steam supply and  

18 

     Table of Contents  

purchase agreements.  Granite City sells steam to U.S. Steel and Haverhill 1 provides steam to Altivia Petrochemicals, LLC ("Altivia").  Our Middletown facility and the second phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill 2, have cogeneration plants that use the hot flue gas created by the cokemaking process to generate electricity, which is either sold into the regional power market or to AK Steel pursuant to energy sales agreements.  
  The following table sets forth information about our cokemaking facilities and our coke, steam and energy sales agreements: 

(1) 
    Cokemaking capacity represents stated capacity for the production of blast furnace coke.  The Middletown coke sales agreement provides for coke sales on a  run of oven  basis, which includes both blast furnace coke and small coke. Middletown capacity on a  run of oven  basis is   578 thousand   tons per year. 
     We also provide coal handling and/or mixing services with our Coal Logistics business, which has collective capacity to mix and/or transload approximately 35 million tons of coal annually and store approximately 3 million tons. CMT is one of the largest export terminals on the U.S. gulf coast and has direct rail access and the capability to transload approximately 10 million tons of coal annually through its operations in Convent, Louisiana.  The facility is supported by long-term, take-or-pay contracts with volume commitments covering all of its current capacity.  Our terminal located in East Chicago, Indiana, Lake Terminal, provides coal handling and mixing services to SunCoke's Indiana Harbor cokemaking operations. KRT is a leading metallurgical and thermal coal mixing and handling terminal service provider with collective capacity to mix and transload approximately 25 million tons of coal annually through its operations in West Virginia.  Coal is transported from the mine site in numerous ways, including rail, truck, barge or ship. Our coal terminals act as intermediaries between coal producers and coal end users by providing transloading, storage and mixing services.  We do not take possession of coal in our Coal Logistics business, but instead earn revenue by providing coal handling and/or mixing services to our customers on a fee per ton basis.  We provide mixing and handling services to steel, coke (including some of our domestic cokemaking facilities), electric utility and coal producing customers. 
    The financial performance of our Coal Logistics business is substantially dependent upon a limited number of customers.  Our CMT customers are impacted by seaborne export market dynamics.  Fluctuations in the benchmark price for coal delivery into northwest Europe, as referenced in the Argus/McCloskey's Coal Price Index report ("API2 index price"), contribute to our customers' decisions to place tons into the export market and thus impact transloading volumes through our terminal facility.      
     While the thermal and metallurgical coal markets were severely challenged during the first half of the year, they have improved in recent months.  A handful of formerly bankrupt coal producers have emerged from reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and a number of formerly idled coal mines have been brought back into service.  Additionally, domestic and global metallurgical and thermal coal prices have surged from previous lows during early 2016, resulting in improved mining economics for previously unprofitable operations.      
  Organized in Delaware in July 2012, and headquartered in Lisle, Illinois, we are a master limited partnership whose common units, representing limited partnership interests, were first listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) in January 2013 under the symbol  SXCP.

Recent Developments  
     CMT Customer Developments 
  A significant portion of our revenues and cash flows from CMT are derived from long-term, take-or-pay contracts with Foresight Energy LP ("Foresight") and Murray American Coal ("Murray").  Previously, Foresight disclosed that it was in default of certain corporate indentures and other debt documents.    However, on August 30, 2016, Foresight completed an out-of-court restructuring of more than $1.4 billion of indebtedness with its bondholders and other creditors that resolved its previously disclosed default.  Additionally on September 1, 2016, Foresight received a Moody's Investors Services upgrade on its corporate family rating to Caa2 from Caa3.    Murray has also been affected by the volatile coal market conditions.   However, on September 28, 2016, Murray's CEO reported that Murray had completed each step in its plan to lower the risk of bankruptcy. He stated that these steps included the ratification of a new labor agreement with United Mine Workers of America and the renegotiation of an EBITDA covenant with the lenders in Murray's financing arrangements.     
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Partnership entered into an agreement with these two customers to provide a volume based rebate in 2016 and 2017 to incentivize throughput in a low API2 index price environment.  The incentives are phased out as the API2 index price increases.  In exchange for the volume incentives, each customer extended its take-or-pay contracts for one year at 2 million tons.  We do not expect these arrangements to impact Adjusted EBITDA targets in 2016.      
     AK Steel Make-Whole  
  Our Haverhill 2 cokemaking facility supplies coke to AK Steel under a long-term, take-or-pay contract until 2022.  During the first quarter of 2016, AK Steel elected to reduce 2016 production by approximately 75 thousand tons at our Haverhill 2 facility.  As a result, Domestic Coke sales tons were lower than our previous volume targets by approximately 23 thousand tons and 59 thousand tons during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.   Based on our long-term, take-or-pay contract, AK Steel has provided us with make-whole payments.  As such, we do not expect this arrangement to impact Adjusted EBITDA targets.

    Total revenues   decreased     $24.7 million  , or   11.8 percent  , to   $185.5 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to the pass-through of lower coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment as well as lower sales volumes in both our Domestic Coke and Coal Logistics segments. 
                
    The Partnership recorded deferred revenue from Coal Logistics take-or-pay billings for minimum volume shortfalls of $8.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, the majority of which is expected to be recognized into revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $1.1 million of deferred revenue from take-or-pay billings recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2015, the majority of which was recognized into revenues during the fourth quarter of 2015.    
                
    Net income attributable to unitholders   increased     $1.8 million   to   $21.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to fair value adjustments to our contingent consideration obligation, mostly offset by the items impacting Adjusted EBITDA, discussed below. 
                 
    Adjusted EBITDA   decreased     $5.0 million   to   $45.7 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $50.7 million   for the same period in   2015     primarily due to lower sales volumes in both our cokemaking and logistics operations as well as lower energy sales as a result of scheduled outages in the current year period.  
      
  Items Impacting Comparability 
             
    Convent Marine Terminal Acquisition.    Comparability between periods was impacted by the acquisition of CMT on August 12, 2015. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, CMT contributed revenues of $7.0 million and $21.7 million, respectively, costs and operating expense of $1.1 million and $11.3 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 million and $12.3 million, respectively.  The costs and operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, included the   $4.6 million   and   $8.3 million   gains, respectively, from the reduction in fair value to the contingent consideration liability.  See   Note 10   to our combined and consolidated financial statements.  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, CMT contributed revenues of $5.7 million, costs and operating expense of $3.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 million.

Energy sales.    Until the second quarter of 2015, Haverhill 1 sold steam to Haverhill Chemicals LLC ("Haverhill Chemicals"), which filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code during 2015. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, Haverhill 1 provided steam, at no cost, to Altivia Petrochemicals, LLC ("Altivia"), which purchased the facility from Haverhill Chemicals.  In the current arrangement, the Partnership is not currently generating revenues from providing steam to Altivia, which may be renegotiated beginning in 2018.  The absence of steam sales decreased total revenues $2.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding period of 2015.  The current arrangement mitigates costs associated with disposing of steam as well as potential compliance issues, which resulted in cost savings of $1.0 million and $1.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
                
    (Gains) Losses on Extinguishment of Debt.    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $1.0 million   and   $24.9 million  , respectively, in connection with the repurchase of Partnership Notes. See   Note 7   to our combined and consolidated financial statements. 
     In connection with the dropdown of Granite City during the first quarter of 2015 ("Granite City Dropdown"), the Partnership assumed and repaid $135.0 million of SunCoke's outstanding notes.  As a result of the redemption, a $9.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt was recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
             
    Income taxes  .   Income tax expense was   $1.4 million   for nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the income tax benefit of   $2.4 million   in the same prior year period.  The periods presented are not comparable, as earnings from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes an income tax benefit of   $4.0 million   related to the tax impacts of the Granite City Dropdown. 
                
    Noncontrolling Interest.     Income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents SunCoke's retained ownership interest in our cokemaking facilities.  Income attributable to noncontrolling interest was   $0.7 million   and   $1.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was   $1.9 million   and   $5.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease is primarily due to SunCoke's decrease in ownership interest in Granite City from a 25 percent interest to a 2 percent interest in August of 2015.

Results of Operations  
  The following table sets forth amounts from the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

Revenues.   Total revenues were   $185.5 million   and   $210.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and were   $561.4 million   and   $621.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  These decreases were primarily due to the pass-through of lower coal costs in our Domestic Coke segment and lower sales volumes in both our Domestic Coke and Coal Logistics segments, partially offset by the impact of the timing of the acquisition of CMT previously discussed in "Items Impacting Comparability." 
  Costs and Operating Expenses.   Total operating expenses were   $152.6 million   and   $176.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and were   $474.1 million   and   $524.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease was primarily driven by reduced coal prices and lower volumes, partially offset by the impact of the timing of the acquisition of CMT previously discussed in "Items Impacting Comparability."  
  Interest Expense, net.   Interest expense, net was   $11.5 million   and   $12.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $35.7 million   and   $34.4 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Additional borrowings in connection with the acquisition of CMT increased interest expense $1.5 million and $8.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and was more than offset by interest expense savings from the repurchase of   $131.9 million   of our senior notes since the fourth quarter of 2015.  
  Income Taxes  .   Income tax expense was   $0.4 million   and   $0.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, and was   $1.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to an income tax benefit of   $2.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Comparability between periods was impacted by the Granite City Dropdown previously discussed in "Items Impacting Comparability." 
  Noncontrolling Interest.    Income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents SunCoke's retained ownership interest in our cokemaking facilities.  Income attributable to noncontrolling interest was   $0.7 million   and   $1.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and was   $1.9 million   and   $5.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Comparability between periods was impacted by the Granite City Dropdown previously discussed in "Items Impacting Comparability." 
  Net Income Attributable to Previous Owner.    Net income attributable to previous owner reflects Granite City net income for periods prior to the Granite City dropdown that occurred in January 2015.

Results of Reportable Business Segments 
  We report our business results through two segments: 
             
    Domestic Coke consists of our Haverhill, Middletown and Granite City cokemaking and heat recovery operations located in Franklin Furnace, Ohio; Middletown, Ohio; and Granite City, Illinois, respectively. 
                
    Coal Logistics consists of our coal handling and/or mixing services in East Chicago, Indiana; Ceredo, West Virginia; Belle, West Virginia; and Convent, Louisiana.  
     Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance and liquidity and it is used as the primary basis for the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable segments.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" near the end of this Item  .

     Analysis of Segment Results 
     Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Domestic Coke 
  Sales and Other Operating Revenue 
  Sales and other operating revenue   decreased     $21.6 million  , or   11.2 percent  , to   $170.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $192.4 million   for the corresponding period of   2015  .  The decrease was mainly due to the pass-through of lower coal prices, which decreased revenues by $16.9 million.  The remaining decrease of $4.7 million was primarily due to lower sales volumes of   20 thousand   tons as compared to the prior year period, which was primarily driven by

     Table of Contents  

lower sales volumes to AK Steel, for which AK Steel provided make-whole payments as previously discussed in "Recent Developments." 
  Adjusted EBITDA 
  Domestic Coke Adjusted EBITDA   decreased     $3.7 million  , or   7.9 percent  , to   $42.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $46.6 million   in the corresponding period of   2015  , primarily due to $1.6 million of lower energy sales related to scheduled outages as well as the timing of sales volumes. 
  Depreciation expense, which was not included in segment profitability, was   $12.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and was reasonably consistent with the prior year period. 
  Coal Logistics 
  Sales and Other Operating Revenue 
  Inclusive of intersegment sales, sales and other operating revenue   decreased     $3.3 million  , or   16.9 percent  , to   $16.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $19.5 million   for the corresponding period of   2015  .  This   decrease   was driven by lower volumes at KRT and Lake Terminal, partly offset by a full quarter of CMT results, which contributed $1.3 million more revenues as compared to the prior year period.  Below-target throughput in the current quarter was driven by demand-side challenges in both the thermal and metallurgical coal markets. 
  Adjusted EBITDA 
  Coal Logistics Adjusted EBITDA   decreased     $2.3 million  , or   24.7 percent  , to   $7.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $9.3 million   in the prior year period.  The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by lower volumes discussed above.  Despite a full quarter of operations, Adjusted EBITDA contributed by CMT was consistent with the prior year as a result of a full quarter of operating costs on only slightly higher volumes.  Adjusted EBITDA results exclude Coal Logistics deferred revenue until it is recognized as GAAP revenue, which is at the end of the annual contract period, or typically in the fourth quarter of each year.  
  Depreciation and amortization expense, which was not included in segment profitability, was   $5.4 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $3.5 million   during the same prior year period, primarily driven by a full quarter of depreciation and amortization of CMT assets. 
  Corporate and Other 
  Corporate and other expenses   decreased     $1.0 million  , or   19.2 percent  , to   $4.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $5.2 million   in the same period of   2015  , primarily due to $2.2 million of acquisition and business development costs incurred in the prior year period, partially offset by current period mark-to-market adjustments in deferred compensation caused by increases in the Partnership's unit price as well as higher legal expenses. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Domestic Coke 
  Sales and Other Operating Revenue 
  Sales and other operating revenue   decreased     $63.9 million  , or   11.0 percent  , to   $517.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $581.1 million   for the corresponding period of   2015  .  The decrease was mainly due to the pass-through of lower coal prices, which decreased revenues by $46.4 million.  The remaining decrease of $17.5 million was primarily the result of lower sales volumes of   71 thousand   tons as compared to the prior year period.  These lower volumes were primarily driven by lower sales volumes to AK Steel, for which AK Steel provided make-whole payments as previously discussed in "Recent Developments," as well as the timing of shipments at Granite City.  
  Adjusted EBITDA 
  Domestic Coke Adjusted EBITDA   decreased     $7.0 million  , or   5.1 percent  , to   $130.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $137.3 million   in the corresponding period of   2015  .  Lower energy sales related to scheduled outages as well as the absence of energy sales to Haverhill Chemicals, as previously discussed in "Items Impacting Comparability," decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $4.4 million.  Lower coal-to-coke yield gains driven by lower coal prices, the timing of sales volumes, and a receivable write-off related to 2015 sales to Essar Algoma further decreased Adjusted EBITDA by $1.1 million, $2.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively.  These impacts were offset by increases of $2.5 million driven by lower operating and maintenance spending. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense, which was not included in segment profitability, was   $38.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and was reasonably consistent with the prior year period.

Coal Logistics 
  Sales and Other Operating Revenue 
  Inclusive of intersegment sales, sales and other operating revenue   increased     $3.9 million  , or   8.7 percent  , to   $48.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $45.0 million   for the corresponding period of   2015  .  The   increase   was driven by nine months of CMT results, which contributed $16.0 million more revenues as compared to the post-acquisition prior year period.  Decreases of $12.1 million partially offset these items, driven by lower volumes at KRT and Lake Terminal.  Below-target throughput for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was driven by demand-side challenges in both the thermal and metallurgical coal markets. 
  Adjusted EBITDA  
  Coal Logistics Adjusted EBITDA   increased     $1.3 million  , or   7.7 percent  , to   $18.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $16.9 million   in the prior year period.  The   increase   was primarily driven by nine months of CMT results, which contributed an additional $8.0 million of Adjusted EBITDA as compared to the post-acquisition prior year period.  The impact of CMT was partially offset by decreases of $6.7 million, driven by lower volumes at KRT and Lake Terminal discussed above.  Adjusted EBITDA results exclude Coal Logistics deferred revenue until it is recognized as GAAP revenue, which is at the end of the annual contract period, or typically in the fourth quarter of each year. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense, which was not included in segment profitability, was   $18.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $7.2 million   during the prior year period, primarily driven by nine months of depreciation and amortization of CMT assets in the current year period.  Additionally, the   Partnership revised the estimated useful lives of certain assets in its Coal Logistics segment, which resulted in additional depreciation of   $2.2 million  , or   $0.05   per common unit, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Corporate and Other 
  Corporate and other expenses   increased     $2.4 million  , or   22.9 percent  , to   $12.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $10.5 million   in the same period of   2015  .  The increase in costs was primarily due to a higher allocation of costs from SunCoke and current period mark-to-market adjustments in deferred compensation caused by increases in the Partnership's unit price, partially offset by acquisition and business development costs of $2.6 million incurred in the prior year period. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  Our primary liquidity needs are to finance the replacement of partially or fully depreciated assets and other capital expenditures, service our debt, fund investments, fund working capital, maintain cash reserves, and pay distributions.  Our sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and, from time to time, debt and equity offerings.  We believe our current resources are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for our current business for the foreseeable future.  We may be required to access the capital markets for funding related to the maturities of our long-term borrowings beginning in 2019.  In addition, we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt. Such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.  The amounts involved may be material.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $46.1 million   of cash and cash equivalents and   $71.5 million   of borrowing availability under the Partnership Revolver.     
    On   October 18, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash distribution of   $0.5940   per unit.  This distribution will be paid on   December 1, 2016   to unitholders of record on   November 15, 2016  .    The Partnership and its Board of Directors will continue to evaluate its capital allocation and distribution priorities on a quarterly basis.     
    On   July 22, 2016  , the Partnership entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement of certain equipment from the Domestic Coke and Coal Logistics segments for total proceeds of   $16.2 million  .  The leaseback agreement has an initial lease period of     60 months  , with an effective interest rate of 5.82 percent and an early buyout option after   48 months   to purchase the equipment at   34.5 percent   of the original lease equipment cost.  The arrangement is accounted for as a financing transaction, resulting in a financing obligation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.    The Partnership repaid   $0.5 million   of the financing obligation during the third quarter of 2016.    Annual future minimum lease payments are approximately   $2.5 million   to   $3.0 million   through   2019   and   $7.3 million   in   2020  , which includes the early buyout option payment.    
    In the first half of 2016, SunCoke took certain actions to support the Partnership's strategy to de-lever its balance sheet and maintain a solid liquidity position.  During the first quarter of 2016, SunCoke provided a "reimbursement holiday" on the   $7.0 million     of corporate costs allocated to the Partnership and also returned its   $1.4 million   IDR cash distribution to the Partnership ("IDR giveback"), resulting in capital contributions of   $8.4 million  .    During the second quarter of 2016, SunCoke provided the Partnership with deferred payment terms until April 2017 on the reimbursement of the   $6.9 million   of allocated corporate costs to the Partnership and the   $1.4 million   IDR cash distribution, resulting in an outstanding payable to SunCoke of  

25 

     Table of Contents  

$8.3 million     included in payable to affiliate, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016  .   SunCoke did not provide sponsor support in the third quarter of 2016 and will not provide sponsor support in the fourth quarter of 2016.        
    Entering 2016, the Partnership anticipated generating excess liquidity of at least   $60 million  , including sponsor support, to meaningfully de-lever the Partnership's balance sheet in 2016.    The Partnership   repurchased     $84.4 million   face value of outstanding Partnership Notes for   $60.0 million   of cash payments in the open market during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016,   resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $24.9 million  .    Additionally, the Partnership repaid   $5.0 million   on the Partnership Revolver during the third quarter of 2016, and subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , on October 4, 2016, the Partnership repaid an additional   $5.0 million   on the Partnership Revolver.    As of   October 25, 2016  , the Partnership had reduced debt by approximately   $80 million   during 2016, net of proceeds received on the sale-leaseback arrangement, utilizing approximately     $55 million   of excess liquidity.  The Partnership expects to achieve our   $60 million   target during the fourth quarter of 2016.      
    During the first quarter of 2016, the Partnership issued   $1.5 million   of letters of credit as collateral to its surety providers in connection with workers' compensation, general liability and other financial guarantee obligations.  
  The Partnership is subject to certain debt covenants that, among other things, limit the Partnership s ability, and the ability of certain of the Partnership s subsidiaries, to (i) incur indebtedness, (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions, (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt, (iv) make loans and investments, (v) sell assets, (vi) incur liens, (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates and (viii) consolidate or merge.  These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications set forth in the respective agreements governing the Partnership's debt.    
  Under the terms of the Partnership Revolver,   the Partnership is subject to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of   4.50  :  1.00  , calculated by dividing total debt by EBITDA as defined by the Partnership Revolver, and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of   2.50  :  1.00  , calculated by dividing EBITDA by interest expense as defined by the Partnership Revolver.    
  Under the terms of the promissory agreement, Raven Energy LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, is subject to a maximum leverage ratio of   5.00  :  1.00   for any fiscal quarter ending prior to August 12, 2018, calculated by dividing total debt by EBITDA as defined by the promissory agreement.  For any fiscal quarter ending on or after August 12, 2018, the maximum leverage ratio is   4.50  :  1.00  .  Additionally in order to make restricted payments, Raven Energy LLC is subject to a fixed charge ratio of greater than   1.00  :  1.00  ,   calculated by dividing EBITDA by fixed charges as defined by the promissory agreement. 
  If we fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the lenders' credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, under the Partnership Revolver could be declared immediately due and payable.  The Partnership has a cross-default provision that applies to our indebtedness having a principal amount in excess of   $20 million  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership was in compliance with all applicable debt covenants contained in the Partnership Revolver and promissory agreement.  We do not anticipate violation of these covenants nor do we anticipate that any of these covenants will restrict our operations or our ability to obtain additional financing.   
  The following table sets forth a summary of the net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities increased by   $51.8 million   to   $140.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $88.2 million   in the corresponding period of   2015  .   The increase reflects CMT's net increase in cash provided by operating activities of $27.5 million, which includes cash received on quarterly take-or-pay billings for minimum volume shortfalls recorded in deferred revenue, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the deferred payment terms on the $6.9 million of corporate costs allocation provided by our sponsor in 2016.  Additionally, in the prior year period, the Partnership received a late customer payment of $18.0 million on October 1, 2015.

     Table of Contents  

Cash Used in Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities decreased   $235.3 million   to   $11.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $246.3 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  .  The decrease is primarily due to the prior year period acquisition of CMT resulting in an investing cash outflow of $193.1 million and an additional $21.5 million of restricted cash withheld to fund the completion of the expansion capital improvements.  Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership amended an agreement with The Cline Group, which unrestricted   $6.0 million   of previously restricted cash and relieved the Partnership of any obligation to repay these amounts to The Cline Group.  The remaining decrease was due to lower capital expenditures excluding the CMT capital expansion costs, which was funded from restricted cash. 
  Cash Used in Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $131.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of   $186.1 million   for the corresponding period of   2015  .  In 2016, we repurchased   $84.4 million   face value of outstanding Partnership Notes for   $60.0 million   of cash in the open market.  The Partnership also repaid   $0.8 million   of the face value Promissory Note and   $5.0 million   on the Partnership Revolver as of   September 30, 2016  .  Additionally, we made distributions to our unitholders of   $86.8 million   and distributions to SunCoke of   $2.8 million  .  The distributions were partially offset by capital contributions from SunCoke of   $8.4 million   from the reimbursement holiday and IDR giveback and the proceeds received from the sale-leaseback arrangement of   $16.2 million  , which is accounted for as a financing obligation. 
  In the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , we received gross proceeds of   $210.8 million   from the issuance of Partnership Notes, $185.0 million drawn on the Partnership Revolver, $30.0 million from the issuance of 1.8 million common units in SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P and $2.3 million from the issuance of general partner interest to SunCoke.  These cash inflows were partially offset by debt issuance costs of $4.5 million, distributions to our unitholders of $75.0 million, repurchase of $10.0 million of common units under the unit repurchase program, distributions to SunCoke of $2.7 million, and the repayment of debt assumed from Suncoke and other liabilities of $149.8 million, including a redemption premium of $7.7 million. 
   
  Capital Requirements and Expenditures 
  Our cokemaking operations are capital intensive, requiring significant investment to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations.  The level of future capital expenditures will depend on various factors, including market conditions and customer requirements, and may differ from current or anticipated levels.  Material changes in capital expenditure levels may impact financial results, including but not limited to the amount of depreciation, interest expense and repair and maintenance expense. 
  Our capital requirements have consisted, and are expected to consist, primarily of: 
             
    Ongoing capital expenditures required to maintain equipment reliability, ensure the integrity and safety of our coke ovens and steam generators and to comply with environmental regulations.  Ongoing capital expenditures are made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of the assets and/or to extend their useful lives and also include new equipment that improves the efficiency, reliability or effectiveness of existing assets.  Ongoing capital expenditures do not include normal repairs and maintenance expenses, which are expensed as incurred; 
                
    Environmental remediation project expenditures required to implement design changes to ensure that our existing facilities operate in accordance with existing environmental permits; and 
                
    Expansion capital expenditures to acquire and/or construct complementary assets to grow our business and to expand existing facilities as well as capital expenditures made to enable the renewal of a coke sales agreement and on which we expect to earn a reasonable return.

The following table summarizes capital expenditures for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(2) 
    Includes capital expenditures of   $11.0 million   and on the ship loader expansion project paid for with pre-funded cash, which was restricted in conjunction with the acquisition of CMT during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Additionally, in connection with this project we had capitalized interest of   $1.9 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
     In 2016, we expect lower ongoing capital spending across the entire fleet and will focus our efforts on projects that are geared toward asset care and increasing workforce safety.  Additionally, we have shifted the timing of the environmental remediation project at Granite City and will focus on the work during 2017 through 2019. 
  In 2016, excluding capitalized interest and pre-funded capital projects at CMT, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately   $17 million  , which includes ongoing capital expenditures of approximately   $12 million  .  We expect that capital expenditures will remain near this level in 2017 and 2018. 
  We retained   $119 million   in proceeds from the IPO, and subsequent dropdowns to fund our environmental remediation projects to comply with the expected terms of a consent decree at the Haverhill and Granite City cokemaking operations. Pursuant to the omnibus agreement, any amounts that we spend on these projects in excess of the   $119 million   will be reimbursed by SunCoke.  Prior to our formation, SunCoke spent approximately   $7 million   related to these projects.  The Partnership has spent approximately   $85 million   to date and the remaining capital is expected to be spent through the first quarter of   2019  . 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Accounting for Goodwill 
    Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired, is tested for impairment as of October 1 of each year, or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to below its carrying value.  The analysis of potential goodwill impairment employs a two-step process.  The first step involves the estimation of fair value of our reporting units.  If step one indicates that impairment of goodwill potentially exits, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any.  Goodwill impairment exists when the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.  The Partnership's Coal Logistics reporting unit had goodwill carrying amounts of   $73.5 million   and   $67.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and     December 31, 2015  , respectively.    See   Note 5   to our combined and consolidated financial statements.    
    The most recent step one analysis resulted in the fair value of the Coal Logistics reporting unit exceeding its carrying value by approximately   10 percent  .    A significant portion of our Coal Logistics business holds long-term, take-or-pay contracts with Murray and Foresight.  Key assumptions in our goodwill impairment test include continued customer performance against long-term, take-or-pay contracts   as well as future contract renewals   and an 18 percent discount rate representing the estimated weighted average cost of capital.  The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments, such as the estimated future cash flows of Coal Logistics and the discount rate used to discount such cash flows, could significantly impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, and therefore, impact the excess fair value above carrying value of the reporting unit.    A 5 percent change in estimated cumulative discounted cash flows of the reporting unit   or a 100 basis point change in the discount rate would not have impacted the results of our step one analysis.

     Table of Contents  

To the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur, such as a loss of either Murray or Foresight as customers, future assessments of goodwill and intangible assets may result in material impairment charges.      
  Accounting for Finite-Lived Intangible Assets 
  We have finite-lived intangible assets with net values of   $179.4 million   and   $187.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016     and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Intangible assets are primarily comprised of customer contracts, customer relationships, and permits.    The permits made up   $133.2 million   and   $137.1 million   of the balance at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and represent the environmental and operational permits required to operate a coal export terminal in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the    EPA   ) and other regulatory bodies.    Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is consumed.    The permits  useful lives were estimated to be 27 years based on the expected useful life of the significant operating equipment at the facility.  These permits have an average remaining renewal term of approximately 3.7 years.  The permits were renewed regularly prior to our acquisition of CMT.  We also have historical experience of renewing and extending similar arrangements at our other facilities and intend to continue to renew our permits as they come up for renewal for the foreseeable future.  
  We test the carrying amount of our finite-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.  This assessment employs a two-step approach.  The first step is used to determine if a potential impairment exists while the second step measures the associated impairment loss, if any.  An impairment loss is recognized if, in performing the impairment review, it is determined that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition.  No triggering events occurred during the years presented.   
       
  Other than the disclosures above, there have been no other significant changes to our accounting policies during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K dated February 18, 2016 for a summary of these policies. 
   
  Recent Accounting Standards 
  See   Note 1   to our consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  In addition to the GAAP results provided in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have provided a non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA. Reconciliation from GAAP to the non-GAAP measurement is presented below. 
  Our management, as well as certain investors, use this non-GAAP measure to analyze our current and expected future financial performance.  This measure is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP and may be different from, or inconsistent with, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 
  Adjusted EBITDA   represents earnings before interest, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for   Coal Logistics changes to our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of the CMT and the expiration of certain acquired contractual obligations.    Adjusted EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net income or operating income under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses.   
  Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of the operating performance and liquidity of the Partnership's net assets and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions.  Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and liquidity.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.    Set forth below is additional discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool.     
  Limitations.   Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.  Adjusted EBITDA also has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations include that Adjusted EBITDA:  
             
    does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;     

29 

     Table of Contents  

does not reflect items such as depreciation and amortization;     
                
    does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;    
                
    does not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest on or principal payments of our debt;    
                
    does not reflect certain other non-cash income and expenses;    
                
    excludes income taxes that may represent a reduction in available cash; and    
                
    includes net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.     
     Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited) to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, which are its most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP:     

(1) 
    Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, in response to the Securities   Exchange Commission s May 2016 update to its guidance on the appropriate use of non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA no longer includes Coal Logistics deferred revenue until it is recognized as GAAP revenue. 
              (2) 
    The Partnership amended the contingent consideration terms with The Cline Group during the first quarter of 2016.  These amendments and subsequent fair value adjustments resulted in gains of   $4.6 million   and   $8.3 million   recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which were excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.    
              (3) 
    In association with the acquisition of CMT, we assumed certain performance obligations under existing contracts and recorded liabilities related to such obligations.  In third quarter of 2016, the final acquired contractual performance obligation expired without the customer requiring performance.  As such, the Partnership reversed the liability in the period as we no longer have any obligations under the contract.    
              (4) 
    Reflects net income attributable to our Granite City facility prior to the Granite City Dropdown on   January 13, 2015   adjusted for Granite City's share of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization during the same period.      
              (5) 
    Reflects net income attributable to noncontrolling interest adjusted for noncontrolling interest's share of interest, taxes, income, and depreciation and amortization.

                 Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures  

Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Partnership carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of   September 30, 2016  .  This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in Partnership reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Partnership reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Partnership's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  On August 12, 2015, the Partnership acquired Raven Energy LLC ("Raven") and considers the transaction material to our results of operations, cash flows and financial position from the date of the acquisition. In conducting our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we have elected to exclude Raven from our evaluation in the year from acquisition as permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are currently in the process of evaluating and integrating Raven s controls over financial reporting.  Raven represented $421.3 million of total assets and $21.7 million of total revenue in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

    Other Information 

Notice of Beginning of Administrative Proceeding 
  The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) mailed a Notice of Beginning of Administrative Proceeding ( NBAP ) to us dated August 18, 2016 stating that the IRS has commenced an audit of our 2013 partnership tax return.  Under IRS regulations, the Partnership is required to communicate the NBAP to all limited partners who hold less than 1 percent of our outstanding units ( Non-Notice Partners ) within 75 days of receipt of the NBAP.   
  To provide the NBAP to its Non-Notice Partners, a copy of the NBAP is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.  To the extent future communications regarding this audit are necessary, they will be provided in a future SEC filing.  We are fully cooperating with the IRS in the audit process.  Although no assurance can be given, we do not anticipate any material changes in prior year taxable income as a result of the audit.  We encourage our unitholders to consult their tax advisers if they have any questions.

Exhibit 95.1 
    
  SunCoke Energy Partners 
  Mine Safety Disclosures for the Quarter Ended   September 30, 2016    
    
  We are committed to maintaining a safe work environment and working to ensure environmental compliance across all of our operations. The health and safety of our employees and limiting the impact to communities in which we operate are critical to our long-term success. We believe that we employ industry best practices and conduct routine training programs and we also focus additional effort and resources each day and each shift to help ensure that our employees are focused on safety. Furthermore, we employ a structured safety and environmental process that provides a robust framework for managing, monitoring and improving safety and environmental performance. 
    
  We have consistently operated our metallurgical coke operations within or near the top quartile for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration s recordable injury rates as measured and reported by the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute. We also have worked to maintain low injury rates reportable to the U.S. Department of Labor s Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ). 
    
  The following table presents the information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters that we are required to report in accordance with Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  Whenever MSHA believes that a violation of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the  Mine Act ), any health or safety standard, or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation which describes the violation and fixes a time within which the operator must abate the violation.  In these situations, MSHA typically proposes a civil penalty, or fine, that the operator is ordered to pay.  In evaluating the following table regarding mine safety, investors should take into account factors such as: (1) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of a coal mine, (2) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector, mine to mine and MSHA district to district and (3) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and during that process are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. 
    
  The mine data retrieval system maintained by MSHA may show information that is different than what is provided in the table below. Any such difference may be attributed to the need to update that information on MSHA s system or other factors. Orders and citations issued to independent contractors who work at our mine sites are not reported in the table below. All section references in the table below refer to provisions of the Mine Act. 

(1) 
    The table does not include the following: (i) facilities which have been idle or closed unless they received a citation or order issued by MSHA, (ii) permitted mining sites where we have not begun operations or (iii) mines that are operated on our behalf by contractors who hold the MSHA numbers and have the MSHA liabilities. 
              (2) 
    Alleged violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard. 
              (3) 
    Alleged failures to totally abate a citation within the period of time specified in the citation. 
              (4) 
    Alleged unwarrantable failure (i.e., aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence) to comply with a mining safety standard or regulation. 

Page 1         

(5) 
    Alleged flagrant violations issued. 
              (6) 
    Alleged conditions or practices which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before such condition or practice can be abated. 
              (7) 
    Amounts shown include assessments proposed during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and do not necessarily relate to the citations or orders reflected in this table.  Assessments for citations or orders reflected in this table may be proposed by MSHA after   September 30, 2016  .    
              (8) 
    Alleged pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other mine health or safety hazards. 
              (9) 
    Alleged potential to have a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other mine health or safety hazards. 
              (10) 
    This number reflects legal proceedings which remain pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the  FMSHRC ) as of   September 30, 2016  . The pending legal actions may relate to the citations or orders issued by MSHA during the reporting period or to citations or orders issued in prior periods. The FMSHRC has jurisdiction to hear not only challenges to citations, orders, and penalties but also certain complaints by miners. The number of  pending legal actions  reported here reflects the number of contested citations, orders, penalties or complaints which remain pending as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (11) 
    The legal proceedings which remain pending before the FMSHRC as of   September 30, 2016   are categorized as follows in accordance with the categories established in the Procedural Rules of the FMSHRC: 
                              Mine or Operating Name/MSHA Identification Number 
    Contests of Citations and Orders (#) 
    Contests of Proposed Penalties (#) 
    Complaints for Compensation (#)

(12) 
    This number reflects legal proceedings initiated before the FMSHRC during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  The number of  initiated legal actions  reported here may not have remained pending as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (13) 
    This number reflects legal proceedings before the FMSHRC that were resolved during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .
