1.       NATURE
OF OPERATIONS AND PURCHASE OF TECHNOLOGY   

a)
 Nature of the Business   

First
National Energy Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 16, 2000, under
the name Capstone International Corporation. On March 28, 2004, the Company changed its name to First National Power Corporation.
On February 12, 2009, the Company relocated its charter to the State of Nevada and changed its name to First National Energy Corporation.
As part of reorganization, the Company increased its authorized capital to 300 million common shares and effected a 100 for 1
reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect
all share data based on the 100 for 1 reverse common stock split.  

The
Company s business purpose is the provision of wind-driven solutions for power generation. Current projects for the Company
are the completion of power generation projects from supplemental wind generation technologies.  

b)
 Purchase of Technology License   

On
April 20, 2009, the Company entered into a preliminary letter of intent with Boreas Research Corporation ( Boreas ),
a Florida corporation, pursuant to which the Company would acquire a territorial license to Supplemental Wind Energy Generator
( SWEG ) and certain rights in alternative energy technology of Boreas, in exchange for a quantity of newly issued
common shares of the Company. The letter of intent was superseded by a Technology License and Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement )
between the Company and Boreas that was consummated on May 25, 2009 (the  Closing ), at which time the Company issued
to the stockholders of Boreas 98,800,000 restricted and unregistered common shares of the Company and agreed to pay certain future
royalties to Boreas from net revenues realized by the Company from the technology license. The consideration issued in the transaction
was determined as a result of arm s-length negotiations between the parties.  

The
preliminary letter of intent was disclosed by the Company on Form 8-K to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
on April 21, 2009, and the Agreement was annexed to an information statement on Form 14-C filed with the SEC in preliminary and
definitive forms on April 22, 2009 and May 4, 2009, respectively. The definitive information statement was mailed to the Stockholders
of the Company on May 4, 2009. The Company obtained written consent to the Agreement and the transaction from the holders of 55.82%
of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock in lieu of a meeting of stockholders.  

On
May 14, 2009, the Company and Boreas amended the Agreement by making and entering into a First Amendment of Technology License
and Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Amendment ), pursuant to which (1) Boreas elected, as authorized by the Agreement,
to cause the restricted and unregistered common shares of the Company due to Boreas at the Closing to be issued to the stockholders
of Boreas, and (2) the Company and Boreas agreed to reduce the number of restricted and unregistered common shares of the Company
to be issued at the closing of the transaction, from 98,915,000 shares to 98,800,000 shares.  

In
exchange for the Company acquiring the technology license from Boreas at the Closing pursuant to the Agreement, as subsequently
amended, the stockholders of Boreas received an aggregate of 98,800,000 restricted and unregistered common shares of the Company s
common stock.. No finder s fees were paid or consulting agreements entered into by the Company in connection with the transaction.

   (Amounts
expressed in US Dollars)   

Prior
to the transaction, there were no material relationships between the Company and Boreas, between Boreas and the Company s
affiliates, directors or officers, or between any associates of Boreas and the Company s officers or directors. All of the
Company s transaction liabilities were settled on or immediately following the Closing.  

Upon
the Closing on May 25, 2009, the Company was no longer deemed to be a  shell company  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). Accordingly, the Company filed an amended current report
on Form 8-K/A with the SEC on May 26, 2009, setting forth the information that would be required if the Company were filing a
general form for registration of securities on Form 10 under the Exchange Act.  

On
April 18, 2011, the Company entered into a Novation Agreement (the  Novation ) with all of the stockholders of Boreas,
revising the structure of the May 25, 2009 transaction. The Novation amended the Technology License and Stock Purchase Agreement
(the  Original Agreement ) to substitute the stockholders of Boreas as the licensor under the Original Agreement.  

Accordingly,
as of September 30, 2016, the Boreas stockholders own 98.893% of the Company s 99,865,228 outstanding shares.  

c)
 Further Purchase of Technology License from Pavana   

On
March 22, 2010, Pavana Power Corporation ( Pavana ), a Nevada corporation, the Company s 99.9% owned subsidiary,
acquired an exclusive territorial 25 year license for the Republic of India ( India ), from Boreas, pursuant to which
the Company s subsidiary acquired technology rights for India in the technology of Boreas that maximizes the energy productivity
of existing wind turbines by capturing energy that flows through and underneath existing wind turbine systems. The consideration
due from the Company s subsidiary to Boreas for the license is a deferred cash payment of $600,000, and a future royalty
equal to 5% of the subsidiary s  EBITDA  (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) from
exploitation of the acquired license.  

The
transaction between related corporations was valued at the amount of the monetary consideration that was provided to Boreas.  

2.       GOING
CONCERN   

The
Company s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America and applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has not generated any revenues from its planned principal
operations through September 30, 2016 and has recorded losses since inception, has negative working capital, has yet to achieve
profitable operations and expects further losses in the development of its business. There can be no assurance that the Company
will have adequate capital resources to fund planned operations or that any additional funds will be available to the Company
when needed, or if available, will be available on favorable terms in the amounts required by the Company. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The interim consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.

   September

   (Amounts
expressed in US Dollars)   

Management
has plans to raise cash through debt offerings once the sales of the technologies begin. The personnel, facilities and equipment
required for successfully completing the business model have been identified but until the resources are available, have not been
acquired or engaged. In the period prior to the onset of operations, the Company will undertake to raise further cash through
further capital offerings. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital.  

3.       SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

a)
 Basis of Presentation and Consolidation   

The
interim unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary First National
Energy (Canada) Corporation and its majority owned subsidiary. All material inter-company amounts have been eliminated.  

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X related to smaller reporting companies.  

The
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and Notes thereto
together with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in the Company s
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary to fairly state the
financial position of the Company at September 30, 2016, the results of its operations for the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, and its cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. In addition, some of the Company s
statements in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q may be considered forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could
significantly impact expected results. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the full year.  

b)
 2016 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan   

On
February 1, 2016, the Board of Directors approved the 2016 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan ( Stock Option Plan )
for employees and non-employees. The Stock Option Plan reserves up to five million shares of common stock for issuance.  

All
awards granted to employees and non-employees after February 1, 2016 are valued at fair value by using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model and recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award. The Company accounts for equity
instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees using the estimated fair market
value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
The value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earlier of a performance
commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services.

   (Amounts
expressed in US Dollars)   

If
there is a modification of the terms of an award, either by repricing or extending the expiry of the award, the award is re-measured.
If the modification results in an increase in the fair value of the new award as compared to the old award immediately prior to
the modification, the excess fair value is recognized as compensation expense.  

As
of September 30, 2016, there was $nil of recognized expense related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements granted.  

4.       LICENSES
FOR TECHNOLOGY   

5.       INTANGIBLE
ASSET   

Effective
February 16, 2016, the Company acquired VAWT/VRTB/Bolotov Rotor wind turbine technology ( Technology ) from Bolotov
and affiliates ( Serge Bolotov ). The technical and intellectual property were designed, patented, developed and manufactured
by Serge Bolotov.  

The
Company valued this technology under the guidance of ASC 350. The purchase consideration is based on the future economic viability
of this intellectual property which on the date of acquisition cannot be measured reliably. In accordance with ASC 350, because
there are no upfront cash consideration for this intellectual property, hence the Company has recorded the technology at a nominal
value of $1.  

The
future compensation to Serge Bolotov consists of;  

10%
    of all royalties for all profits generated by sale of this technology.    

A
    purchase bonus of $1,000,000 to be paid out of 11% of the net profits from the intellectual property.   

(See
    also note 10 (b))   

In
the event the Company or a related or assigned party does not use the assets transferred in the transaction within a period of
3 years from either the date the memorandum is accepted as a final agreement or the date of a Definitive Agreement, the Bolotov
will have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase all unused assets, following ten (10) days written notice to the Company
or a related or assigned party for the amount of US $5,000  

6.       LOAN
PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTY   

On
March 22, 2010, the Company acquired an exclusive territorial 25 year Supplemental Wind Energy Generator technology ( SWEG )
license for The Republic of India ( India ), from Boreas. The stockholders of Boreas hold a controlling interest in
the Company. The technology of Boreas maximizes the energy productivity of existing wind turbines by capturing energy that flows
through and underneath existing wind turbine systems. The consideration due from the Company to Boreas for the license was a deferred
cash payment of $600,000, and a future royalty equal to 5% of the subsidiary s  EBITDA  (earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization) from exploitation of the acquired license.

   (Amounts
expressed in US Dollars)   

On
November 8, 2010, Pavana Power Corporation paid Boreas $60,000 as a payment due under the India technology license agreement,
leaving a balance of cash consideration due of $540,000. The remaining debt is non-interest bearing and is due on demand.  

7.       RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

Transactions
with related parties are incurred in the normal course of business and are measured at the exchange amount which is the amount
of consideration established by and agreed to by the related parties.  

In
2010, the Company s majority owned subsidiary Pavana Power Corporation, purchased the Indian license to the SWEG technology
from Boreas, which is related by virtue of common control. (See note 1 (c)).  

A
director of the Company has advanced monies to the Company to pay certain expenses. The advances are non-interest bearing and
are due on demand. The amount owing to the director was $119,917 ($110,234   2015).  

8.       SEGMENTED
INFORMATION   

The
Company, after reviewing its operating systems, has determined that it has one reportable segment and geographic segment. The
Company s operations are all related to the provision of wind-driven solutions for power generation. All assets of the business
are located in the United States of America.  

9.       FAIR
VALUE MEASUREMENTS   

The
Company follows ASC 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  (ASC 820-10), which among other things, defines
fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability
category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a three-tier fair value hierarchy has been
established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level 1 Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
at the measurement date.   

Fair
valued assets that are generally included in this category are cash and cash equivalents comprised of money market funds, restricted
cash and short-term investments.  

Level 2 Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly
observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the
instrument s anticipated life.

   Condensed
Notes to the Interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements    

   September
30, 2016   

   (Amounts
expressed in US Dollars)   

Level 3 Inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would
use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique
and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.   

At
September 30, 2016, the only asset measured at fair value using level 1 of the three fair value hierarchy tiers described above
was cash of $1,059 ($1,937   2015) and accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $21,269 ($47,853   2015), loan
payable to director and loan payable to related party are measured using amortized cost at level 2. The Company did not have any
fair value assets or liabilities classified as level 3.  

Liquidity
risk:   

The
Company monitors its liquidity position regularly to assess whether it has the funds necessary to fulfill planned commitments
on its alternative energy technology or viable options are available to fund such commitments from new equity issuance or alternative
sources such as debt financing. However, as a development stage company and without significant internally generated cash flow,
there are inherent liquidity risks, including the possibility that additional financing may not be available to the Company, or
that actual development expenditures may exceed those planned. The current uncertainty in global markets could have an impact
on the Company s future ability to access capital on terms that are acceptable to the Company. The Company has so far been
able to raise the required financing to meet its obligations on time.  

10.       COMMITMENT   

a)  
      Pursuant
    to Note 1 (c), under the Technology License purchased by Pavana, the Company has a commitment for royalties at the rate of
    5% for all revenues derived by Pavana using this technology.   

b)  
      Pursuant
    to the purchase of intellectual property from Serge Bolotov, the Company has a commitment for royalties at the rate of 10%
    for all profits generated by the sale of this technology and a purchase bonus of $1,000,000 to be paid out of 11% of the net
    profits from the intellectual property.    

c)  
      Following
    completion of sufficient funding of the Company or related or assigned party, the following shall occur   

a.  
      Serge
    Bolotov will be paid the sum of Cdn $8,000 per month in cash or shares, as long as Bolotov is needed to consult with the Company
    or a related or assigned party   

b.  
      The
    Company or related or assigned party will provide research and development facility with support staff.   

d)  
      The
    Company or a related or assigned party will act to appoint Serge Bolotov as a member of the Board of Directors. Upon successful
    appointment to the Board, the Company or a related or assigned party will issue Bolotov 100,000 common shares in consideration
    for his Board of Director appointment.

MANAGEMENT

of capital in order to enhance value to shareholders. As part of this objective the Company seeks to maintain access to loan and
capital markets at all times. The Board of Directors reviews the capital structure of the Group on a regular basis.  

Capital
structure and debt capacity are taken into account when deciding new investments. Practical tools to manage capital include application
of dividend policy, share buybacks and share issuances. Debt capital is managed considering the requirement to secure liquidity
and the capability to refinance maturing debt.  

The
Group s internal capital structure is reviewed on a regular basis with an aim to optimize the structure e.g. by applying
internal dividends and equity adjustments. Net investment in foreign entities is monitored and the Company has the intent to hedge
related translation risk.  

On
September 30, 2016 the Company does not have any interest-bearing debt.

Description
of Business   

Business
Development  

We
were incorporated as Capstone International Corporation on November 16, 2000, in the state of Delaware, and our shares were registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form SB-2 as SEC File No. 333-62588, filed on June 8, 2001. Our name was changed
to  First National Power Corporation  on January 28, 2004, and was changed again to  First National Energy Corporation 
on February 12, 2009, at which time we affected a reverse stock split, adopted a holding company structure, and relocated our
corporate charter from Delaware to Nevada as part of the reorganization described in the next succeeding paragraph.  

As
described in the definitive information statement on Form DEF 14-C filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December
22, 2008, and pursuant to the approval of our board of directors and a majority of its stockholders, on February 12, 2009, we
effected a reorganization which had the effect of (1) implementing a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common
shares at the rate of 100 to 1, thereby reducing the number of issued and outstanding common shares at that time from 76,522,760
to 765,228, with no effect on the number of authorized common shares; (2) merging our company with and into First National Power
Corporation, a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned indirect (second tier) subsidiary of our company , such that First National
Energy Corporation, a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned direct (first tier) subsidiary of our company, succeeded as a successor
issuer of its registered securities and continued our business for all purposes; (3) exchanging each issued and outstanding share
on the record date (and after giving effect to the reverse stock split described above) into one new common share of the successor
issuer ; (4) re-domesticating the our charter from the State of Delaware to the State of Nevada; (5) increasing the authorized
capital from 100 million common shares to 300 million common shares; (6) changing our name from  First National Power Corporation 
to  First National Energy Corporation  and (7) changing our stock symbol from FNPR to FNEC.  

On
April 20, 2009, we acquired a territorial license to certain rights in alternative wind energy technology in exchange for 98,800,000
newly issued common shares, which resulted in a change in control. We valued the technology license received in such transaction
at $1,855,605 after consulting with an outside valuation expert.  

On
April 18, 2011, we entered into a Novation Agreement (the  Novation ) with all of the stockholders of Boreas Research
Corporation ( Boreas ), a Florida corporation, revising the structure of the April 20, 2009 transaction by which we
acquired a territorial license to certain rights in alternative energy technology of Boreas, in exchange for 98,800,000 of our
common shares as disclosed above. The Novation amended the 2009 agreement to substitute the stockholders of Boreas as the licensor
under the original 2009 agreement.  

In
addition, we acquired technology rights to an additional territory for the licensed technology through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
Pavana Power Corporation.  

Business
of Issuer  

Since
acquiring the technology license described above, our management has expended significant time seeking sources of capital to implement
our business plan, which is primarily designed to exploit the licensed technology throughout the United States and Canada for
commercial gain. In addition, we have acquired technology rights to an additional territory for the licensed technology. Management
is also evaluating other alternatives in order to improve our financial condition, including merger and acquisition opportunities.
There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising capital or closing any such merger or acquisition transactions.  

Except
as described above and as more particularly described in our accompanying interim financial statements, there have been no other
material changes in our financial condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year to the date of the interim balance sheet
provided herein, nor have there been any other material changes in the registrant s financial condition during the period
ending on the date of the interim balance sheet provided herein and commencing on the corresponding interim date of the preceding
fiscal year. Except as described above and as more particularly described in our accompanying interim financial statements, there
have been no material changes in our results of operations with respect to the most recent fiscal year-to-date period for which
an income statement is provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of the preceding fiscal year.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The
consolidated financial statements of our company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected
by accounting policies, estimates and assumptions that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles.
Estimates used in the financial statements are derived from prior experience, statistical analysis and professional judgments.
Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions.  

Management
considers an estimate to be critical if it is material to the financial statements and it requires assumptions to be made that
were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements.  

See
Note 1,  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements , of the Notes to the accompanying interim financial statements, included
in Item 1 of this report, for recently issued accounting pronouncements.  

Plan
of Operation   

Since
acquiring the technology license described above, our management has expended significant time seeking sources of capital to implement
its business plan, which is primarily designed to exploit the licensed technology throughout the United States and Canada for
commercial gain. In addition, we have acquired technology rights to an additional territory for the licensed technology through
Pavana Power Corporation, a Nevada corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary that was organized on April 21, 2011.. There is no assurance
that the Registrant will be successful in raising capital or closing any such merger or acquisition transactions.  

Results
of Operations    

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016, compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Assets  

Licensed
technology assets, net of amortization, were unchanged at $200  

Revenues  

We
did not generate any operating revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Costs
and Expenses  

Amortization
of Acquired Technology  

There
was no amortization of our technology assets during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $-0- during the
comparable period in 2015.  

General
and Administrative  

Operating
expenses increased to $-0- during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $-0- during the comparable period
in 2015.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016, compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015

We
did not generate any operating revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Costs
and Expenses  

Amortization
of Acquired Technology  

There
was no amortization of our technology assets during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $-0- during the
comparable period in 2015.  

General
and Administrative  

Operating
expenses increased to $-0- during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $-0- during the comparable period
in 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Cash
and cash equivalents were $1,059 at September 30, 2016, compared to $1,937 at December 31, 2015.  

Net
cash used in operating activities was $10,560 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $-0- during the
comparable period in 2015.  

We
generated $-0- from financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $-0-during the
comparable period in 2015 due to additional funding by a shareholder.  

We
are a development stage company and have not generated any operating revenues as of September 30, 2016. In addition, we will continue
to incur net losses and cash flow deficiencies from operating activities for the foreseeable future.  

Based
on its cash flow projections, we will need additional financing to carry out its planned business activities and complete its
plan of operations through December 31, 2016. At the Company s present level of activities, the Company s cash and
cash equivalents are considered insufficient and this draws a substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern.  

Much
of our ability to raise additional capital or secure a strategic collaboration for the financing of our continued operations and
product development will depend substantially on the successful outcome of our efforts to negotiate joint venture with wind power
industry participants, the results of which will not be available until sometime later in the current fiscal year. We are also
currently seeking to raise funds through corporate collaboration and sub-licensing arrangements in connection with its ongoing
and long-term operations. Management does not know whether additional financing will be available when needed or, if available,
will be on acceptable or favorable terms to it or its stockholders.  

The
Company s independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern in the audit report on the Company s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015 included in the 2015 Form 10-K and in the footnotes to these unaudited financial statements for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to investors.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Item

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

As
of September 30, 2016, the Registrant carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Registrant s disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) under the supervision and with the participation
of the Registrant s chief executive and chief financial officer. Based on and as of the date of such evaluation, the aforementioned
officer has concluded that the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.  

The
Registrant also maintains a system of internal accounting controls that is designed to provide assurance that assets are safeguarded
and that transactions are executed in accordance with management s authorization and properly recorded. This system is continually
reviewed and is augmented by written policies and procedures, the careful selection and training of qualified personnel and an
internal audit program to monitor its effectiveness.  

Changes
In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

During
the interim period ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes to this system of internal controls or in other factors that
