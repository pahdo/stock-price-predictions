To:  
      The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of  
Punto Group, Corp.   

We
have reviewed the accompanying balance sheets of Punto Group, Corp. as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the related
statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and statements of cash flows for the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the company s management.  

We
conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review
of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding
the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  

Based
on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements
referred to above for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

We
have previously audited, in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the balance sheet of Punto Group, Corp. as of December 31, 2015, and the related statements of operations, comprehensive loss,
stockholders  deficiency, and cash flows for the year then ended and in our report dated April 14, 2016, we expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying balance sheet
as of December 31, 2015, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance sheet from which it has been derived.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company had incurred substantial losses in previous years, which raises substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regards to these matters are also described
in Note 2. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1.      NATURE
                                         OF OPERATIONS     

Punto
Group, Corp. (the  Company ) is a for profit corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada,
United States of America on September 2, 2014.  

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America and are presented in US dollars. The financial statements and related disclosures as of September 30, 2016 are
reviewed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  

Unless
the context otherwise requires, all references to  Punto Group, Corp.,   we,   us,   our 
or the  company  are to Punto Group, Corp. and any subsidiaries.  

2.      BASIS
                                         OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN     

Basis
of Presentation   

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).  

The
statements and related notes have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and other information included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as filed with the SEC.  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For
the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company had accumulated deficits of $61,538. The Company s ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably or raise
additional capital through debt financing and/or through sales of common stock.  

Management
plans to fund operations of the Company through the proceeds from an offering pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1
or private placements of restricted securities or the issuance of stock in lieu of cash for payment of services until such a time
as profitable operations are achieved.  If
we do not raise all of the money we need from public offerings, we will have to find alternative sources, such as loans or advances
from our officers, directors or others. Such additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be
no assurance that any additional financing that the Company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term.
There are no written agreements in place for such funding or issuance of securities and there can be no assurance that such will
be available in the future. Management believes that this plan provides an opportunity for the Company to continue as a going
concern.  

The
failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability or obtain the additional funding would be detrimental to the Company.

3.      SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.  

Due
to the limited level of operations, the Company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption
that the Company is a going concern.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

ASC
825,  Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments , requires disclosure of fair value information about
financial instruments.  ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements  defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  Fair value
estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September
30, 2016.  

The
respective carrying values of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximate their fair values.  These financial
instruments include cash, accrued liabilities and notes payable.  Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values
for these financial instruments since they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair value.  

Basic
and Diluted Loss Per Share   

The
Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10-45  Earnings per Share , which requires presentation
of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed
by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during
the period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the
period.  Dilutive earnings (loss) per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company
has no potential dilutive instruments, and therefore, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are equal.

 Notes to Financial Statements 

 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 

 (Stated in U.S. Dollars) 

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company will recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 605,  Revenue Recognition 
( ASC-605 ). ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized:  

1.    Persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists  

2.    Delivery
has occurred  

3.    The
selling price is fixed and determinable  

4.    Collectability
is reasonably assured.  

Determination
of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgment regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered
and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances,
or other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for
which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine
that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company s
results of operations, financial position or cash flow.  

Comprehensive
Income   

Comprehensive
income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting stockholders  equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded
from net income. There was no recorded comprehensive income or loss for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Basic
and Diluted Net Loss Per Share   

Our
computation of earnings per share ( EPS ) includes basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as the income
(loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution, using the treasury stock method, that could occur if securities or
other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common
stock that then shared in the income (loss) of the Company as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods
presented, or issuance date, if later. In computing diluted income (loss) per share, the treasury stock method assumes that
outstanding options and warrants are exercised and the proceeds are used to purchase common stock at the average market price
during the period. Options and warrants may have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when the average
market price of the common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options and warrants. Potential common
shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded
from the calculation of diluted EPS.

 Notes to Financial Statements 

 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 

 (Stated in U.S. Dollars) 

Income
(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the respective periods. Basic and diluted (loss) per common share is the same for periods in which the company reported
an operating loss because all warrants and stock options outstanding are anti-dilutive.  

There
were no adjustments to net loss required for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share.  

For
the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no potential dilutive securities.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

On
March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07  Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying
the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting , which simplifies the equity method of accounting by eliminating the
requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting as a result
of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. Consequently, when an investment qualifies for the equity
method (as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence), the cost of acquiring the additional
interest in the investee would be added to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and the equity method
would be applied subsequently from the date on which the investor obtains the ability to exercise significant influence over the
investee. The ASU further requires that unrealized holding gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income related to
an available-for-sale security that becomes eligible for the equity method be recognized in earnings as of the date on which the
investment qualifies for the equity method.  

The
guidance in the ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
within those fiscal years; early adoption is permitted for all entities. Entities are required to apply the guidance prospectively
to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence occurring after the ASU s effective date. Additional
transition disclosures are not required upon adoption.  

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions
for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding
requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods.

 Notes to Financial Statements 

 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 

 (Stated in U.S. Dollars) 

On
August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) . Stakeholders indicated that
there is diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of
cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. This Update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with
the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business
entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments
should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption
must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. As a result, the Company has elected to early adopt this Update prospectively
as of September 30, 2016 and prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted.  

As
of September 30, 2016, except for the above, there are no recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would have
a material effect on the Company s financial statements.  

4.      RELATED
                                         PARTY TRANSACTIONS     

The
director of the Company provides services free of charge. The Company's sole officer and director is involved in other business
activities and may in the future, become involved in other business opportunities as they become available.  

As
of December 31, 2015, the Company s former stockholders provided net advances of $14,468 to finance the Company s
working capital requirements. The Company underwent a change of control in January 2016, which the majority ownership was transferred
to a new majority shareholder. The former shareholder forgave the $14,468 advances at the date of the transfer, and the Company
recognized a one-time gain of $14,468 which is included as gain on change of control in the Company s results of operations
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016.  

As
of September 30, 2016, there were advances of $14,641 from the current shareholder for the purpose of operating the Company.  

5.   
      SUBSEQUENT  EVENTS    

The
Company has evaluated subsequent events from September 30, 2016 through the date the financial statements were available to be
issued. There was no subsequent event at the report date.  

Item
    2.   
       Management s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current
expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   could, 
 would,   expect,   plan,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate, 
 continue,  or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with our Financial Statements and related Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The terms  we, 
 our  and  the Company  used throughout this report refer to Punto Group, Corp., a Nevada corporation.  

Overview   

We
were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 2, 2014. The Company intends to investigate and, if such investigation warrants,
acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business
objective will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term
earnings. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever consummate a business combination and achieve long-term growth
potential or immediate, short-term earnings from any business combination the Company enters into.  

Results
of Operations   

We
have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going
concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.  

Our
net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $9,097 compared to a loss of $19,950 during the three-month period
ended September 30, 2015. Our general and administrative expenses represent fees paid for legal and accounting services in connection
with our public company reporting obligations. We did not generate any revenue during these periods.  

Our
net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $12,161 compared to a loss of $23,450 during the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2015. Our general and administrative expenses represent fees paid for legal and accounting services in connection
with our public company reporting obligations. We did not generate any revenue during these periods. However, due to a gain on
change of control of $14,468 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2016, we experienced net income of $6,254 during such
period.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We
expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to finance our operations through
advancements, the sale of equity or debt securities until we consummate a business combination. We currently have a limited amount
of cash, and will need additional capital in order to continue operating. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities
will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior
to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available
or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities,
which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.  

The
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize
our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.  

As
of September 30, 2016, our total assets were $0 compared to $3,191 in total assets at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016,
our total liabilities were $31,738, compared to $22,768 in total liabilities at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, total
liabilities were comprised of $17,097 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $14,641 in related party payables. As of
December 31, 2015, total assets were comprised of $3,191 in cash and total liabilities were comprised of $8,300 in accounts payable
and accrued liabilities and $14,468 in related party payables.  

Stockholders 
deficiency was ($31,738) as of September 30, 2016 compared to ($19,577) as of December 31, 2015.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.
