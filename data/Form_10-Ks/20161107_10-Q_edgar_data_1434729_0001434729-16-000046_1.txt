  NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION 
  Company Overview 
  HSN, Inc. ( HSNi ) is an interactive multi-channel retailer that markets and sells a wide range of third party and proprietary merchandise directly to consumers through various platforms including (i) television home shopping programming broadcast on the HSN television networks and other direct-response television marketing; (ii) catalogs, consisting primarily of the Cornerstone portfolio of leading print catalogs which includes Ballard Designs, Frontgate, Garnet Hill, Grandin Road and Improvements; (iii) websites, which consist primarily of HSN.com, joymangano.com and the five branded websites operated by Cornerstone; (iv) mobile applications; (v) retail and outlet stores; and (vi) wholesale distribution of certain proprietary products to other retailers. HSNi s television home shopping business, related digital sales, outlet stores and wholesale distribution are referred to herein as  HSN  and all catalog operations, including related digital sales and stores, are collectively referred to herein as  Cornerstone.   Chasing Fireflies and TravelSmith, two of the apparel brands in the Cornerstone portfolio, were sold in September 2016.  See Note 14 for further discussion. 
  HSN offerings primarily consist of jewelry, fashion (apparel   accessories), beauty   health (including beauty, wellness and fitness), and home   other (including home, electronics, culinary and other). Merchandise offered by Cornerstone primarily consists of home furnishings (including indoor/outdoor furniture, home d cor, tabletop, textiles and other home related goods) and apparel   accessories. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  They do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of HSNi's management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with HSNi's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   and the consolidated statement of shareholders' equity for the year ended   December 31, 2015   were derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but may not include all disclosures required by GAAP.  Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.   
    
  Recent Accounting Developments 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standard Updates 
    
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ("ASU 2015-03"). ASU 2015-03 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability.  The new standard is limited to the presentation of debt issuance costs and does not affect their recognition and measurement.  ASU 2015-03 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that annual period. HSNi retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016 resulting in the reclassification of its debt issuance costs from "Other non-current assets" to a deduction from "Long-term debt, less current maturities and net of unamortized deferred financing costs" in the consolidated balance sheets.  See Note 6 for additional information regarding the deferred issuance costs.  
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement ("ASU 2015-05"), which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a service contract.  HSNi prospectively adopted ASU 2015-05 on January 1, 2016 and will apply this guidance to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date. 

6 

Accounting Standard Updates Not Yet Adopted 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09").  ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service.  A customer obtains control when it has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the good or service.  Additionally, ASU 2014-09 will disallow the capitalization of direct-response advertising costs which will impact the timing of recognition of Cornerstone's catalog production and distribution costs.  In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09.  This standard will now become effective for HSNi in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is permitted in the first quarter of 2017.  HSNi is in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to its consolidated financial statements and is evaluating the accounting, transition method, disclosure requirements and timing of adoption. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330) ("ASU 2015-11"). The amendments, which apply to inventory that is measured using any method other than the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or retail inventory method, require that entities measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016 and should be applied on a prospective basis; however, early adoption is permitted.  HSNi will adopt ASU 2015-11 on January 1, 2017.  HSNi is currently assessing the potential impact ASU 2015-11 will have to its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02").  ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations. The effective date for the standard is for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.   The standard is to be applied on a modified retrospective method.  HSNi is currently assessing the timing of adoption of ASU 2016-02 and the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) ("ASU 2016-09").   This standard makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. The effective date for the standard is for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  HSNi is currently assessing the timing of adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Reclassifications were made to prior period amounts to conform to the current year's presentation.  Changes included the reclassification of certain operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and reclassification of deferred income taxes and deferred financing costs in the consolidated balance sheets due to the implementation of recent accounting standard updates.  Current deferred tax assets of    $24.1 million   in the September 30, 2015 consolidated balance sheet were reclassified as non-current and netted against non-current deferred tax liabilities as a result of retrospectively adopting ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, in the fourth quarter of 2015.   
   
  NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Accounting Estimates 
  HSNi prepares its financial statements in conformity with GAAP. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. They also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  In the opinion of HSNi's management, the assumptions underlying these interim unaudited financial statements are reasonable. 
  
   7 

Significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include: the determination of the lower of cost or market adjustment for inventory; sales returns and other revenue allowances; the allowance for doubtful accounts; the recoverability of long-lived assets; the impairment of intangible assets; the annual expected effective tax rate; the determination of deferred income taxes, including related valuation allowances; the accrual for actual, pending or threatened litigation, claims and assessments; and assumptions related to the determination of incentive compensation and contingent consideration.     
   
  NOTE 3 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
  The balance of property and equipment, net, is as follows (in thousands): 

NOTE 4 SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  HSNi presents its operating segments and related financial information in a manner consistent with how the chief operating decision maker and executive management view the businesses, how the businesses are organized as to segment management, and the focus of the businesses with regards to the types of products or services offered and/or the target market. HSNi has two reportable segments, HSN and Cornerstone. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in HSNi's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  HSNi s primary performance metric is Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as operating income excluding, if applicable: (1) non-cash charges including: (a) stock-based compensation expense, (b) amortization of intangibles, (c) depreciation and gains and losses on asset dispositions, and (d) goodwill, long-lived asset and intangible asset impairments; (2) pro forma adjustments for significant acquisitions; and (3) other significant items. Significant items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period, thereby affecting the comparability of results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and HSNi believes it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the retail and media industries. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to HSNi s consolidated statements of operations of certain expenses, gains and losses; including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, depreciation, gains and losses on asset dispositions, asset impairment charges, acquisition-related accounting expenses and other significant items.

The following tables reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to operating income for HSNi s operating segments and to HSNi s consolidated net income (in thousands): 

The net sales for each of HSNi's reportable segments are as follows (in thousands): 

NOTE 5 EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  HSNi computes basic earnings per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. HSNi computes diluted earnings per share using the treasury stock method, which includes the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus the potential dilution that could occur if various equity awards to issue common stock were exercised or restricted equity awards were vested resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in HSNi s earnings.

The following table presents HSNi s basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data): 

NOTE 6 LONG-TERM DEBT 
  The balance of long-term debt, including current maturities, is as follows (in thousands): 

On January 27, 2015, HSNi entered into a   $1.25 billion     five  -year syndicated credit agreement ("Credit Agreement") which is secured by   100%   of the voting equity securities of HSNi's U.S. subsidiaries and   65%   of HSNi's first-tier foreign subsidiaries.  This Credit Agreement replaced the credit agreement that was set to expire in April 2017.  Certain HSNi subsidiaries have unconditionally guaranteed HSNi's obligations under the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement, which includes a   $750 million   revolving credit facility and a   $500 million   term loan, may be increased up to   $1.75 billion   subject to certain conditions and expires January 27, 2020.  HSNi drew   $200 million   from its term loan under the Credit Agreement on January 27, 2015 to repay in full its existing term loan of   $228.1 million  .  HSNi drew the remaining   $300 million   from the term loan and   $200 million   under the revolving credit facility, both under the Credit Agreement, on February 18, 2015 to fund a   $524 million   special cash dividend that was paid on February 19, 2015. 
    
  In connection with the termination of the prior credit agreement,   $0.5 million   of the   $2.4 million   of unamortized deferred financing costs were expensed in the first quarter of 2015.  The remaining balance of   $1.9 million   along with the   $6.6 million   in capitalized financing costs related to the Credit Agreement are being amortized to interest expense over the five-year term of the Credit Agreement.  Capitalized financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, are presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability for all periods presented. 
    
  The Credit Agreement includes various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities including a maximum leverage ratio of   3.50  x and a minimum interest coverage ratio of   3.00  x (both as defined in the Credit Agreement).  HSNi was in compliance with all such covenants as of   September 30, 2016   with a leverage ratio of   1.9  x and an interest coverage ratio of   22.7  x.  The Credit Agreement also contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions to third parties,  
  
   10 

repurchase or redeem our stock, make investments, sell assets, incur liens, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.  The Credit Agreement also contains provisions that limit the ability of HSNi to make Restricted Payments, defined as cash dividends, distribution of other property, repurchase of the Company s common stock, prepayment or redemption of debt, etc., however, so long as the Company s leverage ratio is below   3.00  x after giving pro forma effect to any proposed Restricted Payments, the amount of such Restricted Payments are not limited. In the event the Company s leverage ratio is equal to or greater than   3.00  x or after giving pro forma effect to any proposed Restricted Payments, then such Restricted Payments are limited to   $150 million   in any such fiscal year. The current cash dividend of   $1.40   annually per share represents a Restricted Payment of approximately   $73.2 million  .  Dividends, loans or advances to HSNi by its subsidiaries are not restricted by the Credit Agreement.  
    
  Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus a predetermined margin that ranges from   1.25%   to   2.25%   or the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a predetermined margin that ranges from   0.25%   to   1.25%  .  HSNi can elect to borrow at either LIBOR or the Base Rate plus a predetermined margin which is determined by HSNi's leverage ratio.  The interest rate on the   $631.3 million   outstanding long-term debt balance as of   September 30, 2016   was   2.02%  .  HSNi pays a commitment fee ranging from   0.20%   to   0.40%   (based on the leverage ratio) on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility.   
    
  The amount available to HSNi under the revolving credit facility portion of the Credit Agreement is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, which totaled   $13.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . The ability to draw funds under the revolving credit facility is dependent upon meeting the aforementioned financial covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount that could be borrowed under the revolving credit facility, after consideration of the financial covenants and the outstanding letters of credit, was approximately   $586.1 million  .  

NOTE  7 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
  HSNi uses derivatives in the management of its interest rate risk with respect to its variable rate debt.  HSNi's strategy is to eliminate the cash flow risk on a portion of its variable rate debt caused by changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR).  Derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes. 
    
  HSNi uses interest rate swap contracts to eliminate the cash flow risk on a portion of its variable rate debt.  HSNi pays at a fixed rate and receives payments at a variable rate based on one-month LIBOR. The swaps effectively fix the floating LIBOR-based interest of our outstanding LIBOR-based debt.  The interest rate swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges; therefore, the effective portions of the changes in fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Any ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps will be immediately recognized in earnings in the consolidated statements of operations.  
    
  The interest rate swaps effectively convert   $187.5 million   of our variable rate term loan to a fixed-rate of   0.8525%   through April 2017, and then increases to   $250.0 million   in April 2017 with a maturity date in January 2020 with a fixed rate of   1.05%   (in both cases the swapped fixed rate is exclusive of the credit spread under the Credit Agreement).  Based on HSNi's leverage ratio as of   September 30, 2016  , the all-in fixed rate was   2.3525%  .  The changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps (inclusive of reclassifications to net income and net of tax) for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were income of approximately   $0.9 million   and a loss of approximately   $0.2 million  , respectively, and were included in other comprehensive income (loss). The changes in fair value of the interest rate swap (inclusive of reclassifications to net income and net of tax) for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were losses of approximately   $0.6 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively, and were included in other comprehensive income (loss).  
    
  The fair values of the interest rate swaps at   September 30, 2016  , December 31,   2015   and   September 30, 2015   were liabilities of   $1.2 million  ,   $0.2 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively, and were recorded in "Other long-term liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets. HSNi estimates that approximately   $0.6 million   of unrealized losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these swaps will be realized and reported in earnings within the next twelve months. See Note 8 for discussion of the fair value measurements concerning these interest rate swaps.   

11 

NOTE 8 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  Fair value assumptions are made at a specific point in time and changes in underlying assumptions could significantly affect these estimates.  HSNi applies the following framework for measuring fair value which is based on a three-level hierarchy: 
  Level 1   Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 
  Level 2   Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
  Level 3   Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. 
    
  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these items.  The following table summarizes the fair value of HSNi's other financial assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):   

HSNi's interest rate swaps are carried on the balance sheet at fair value.  The swaps are entered into for the purpose of hedging the variability of interest expense and interest payments on HSNi's long-term variable rate debt.  The fair value is based on a valuation model which utilizes interest rate yield curves and credit spreads as the significant inputs to the model.  These inputs are observable in active markets (level 2 criteria).  HSNi considers credit risk associated with its own standing as well as the credit standing of any counterparties involved in the valuation of its financial instruments.   
  
   12 

The following table summarizes the fair value of HSNi s financial assets and liabilities which are carried at cost (in thousands): 

The fair value of the term loan was estimated by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to HSNi for debt of the same remaining maturities (level 2 criteria). 
  HSNi assesses the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at fair value at least annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.  HSNi also measures certain assets, such as property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, at fair value on a non-recurring basis.   
  At June 30, 2016, the assets and liabilities of Chasing Fireflies and TravelSmith were considered to be a disposal group held for sale.  Therefore, the disposal group was measured at its fair value less the estimated costs to sell which resulted in a non-cash asset impairment charge of   $20.4 million   that was recognized during the second quarter.  On September 8, 2016, Cornerstone completed the divestiture of Chasing Fireflies and TravelSmith and recorded a loss on sale of   $11.2 million   during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  See Note 14 for further discussion.  As a result of the divestiture, HSNi performed a qualitative assessment of its goodwill and noted no impairment as of September 30, 2016. 
  During the third quarter of 2015, HSNi performed a quantitative assessment of certain intangible assets related to its acquisition of Chasing Fireflies and concluded a fair value adjustment was necessary.  An impairment charge of   $5.0 million   was recorded in the third quarter of 2015 within the Cornerstone segment and is included in "Loss on sale of businesses and asset impairment" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  The fair value of the intangible assets, consisting of trademarks and tradenames, was determined using the relief from royalty method (level 3 criteria).  Key inputs used in this calculation included revenue growth and discount, royalty and terminal growth rates. 

NOTE 9 INCOME TAXES 
  HSNi calculates its interim income tax provision in accordance with the accounting guidance for income taxes in interim periods. At the end of each interim period, HSNi makes its best estimate of the annual expected effective tax rate and applies that rate to its ordinary year-to-date income or loss. The tax or benefit related to significant or unusual items that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effect are individually computed and recognized in the interim period in which those items occur.  
  In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws or rates, tax status, or judgment on the realizability of beginning-of-the-year deferred taxes in future years is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs. 
  The computation of the annual expected effective tax rate at each interim period requires certain estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, the expected operating income for the year, permanent and temporary differences, and the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets generated in the current year. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes may change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, additional information is obtained or the tax environment changes. To the extent that the estimated annual effective tax rate changes during a quarter, the effect of the  
  
   13 

change on prior quarters is included in tax expense for the current quarter. 
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , HSNi recorded tax provisions of   $12.7 million   and   $45.7 million  , respectively, which represents effective tax rates of   38.7%   and   37.8%  .  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , HSNi recorded tax provisions of   $19.6 million   and   $64.8 million  , respectively, which represents effective tax rates of   36.4%   and   37.2%  .  
  The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has concluded its examination of HSNi's consolidated federal income tax return for the year ended December 31, 2010 and its limited scope examination of HSNi's consolidated federal income tax return for the year ended December 31, 2011.  No material adjustments resulted from these IRS examinations. There are currently no income tax examinations in progress.  New York State concluded an income tax examination of the years ended December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2013.  No material adjustment to our tax liabilities resulted from this examination. 
  HSNi and several companies previously owned by IAC/InterActiveCorp, or IAC, were spun-off from IAC on August 20, 2008.  In connection with the spin-off, HSNi entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement with IAC.  Pursuant to this agreement, each of the companies included in the spin-off (the "Spincos") was indemnified by IAC for additional tax liabilities related to consolidated or combined federal and state tax returns prepared and filed by IAC prior to the spin-off.  However, each Spinco agreed to, among other things, assume any additional tax liabilities related to their separately filed state income tax returns.  All examinations have concluded or statutes of limitations have expired related to IAC's consolidated or combined federal and state tax returns for years including HSNi operations prior to the spin-off. 
  The Tax Sharing Agreement also provides, among other things, that each Spinco indemnifies IAC and the other Spincos for any taxes resulting from the spin-off of such Spinco (and any related interest, penalties, legal and professional fees, and all costs and damages associated with related shareholder litigation or controversies) to the extent such amounts result from any post spin-off (i) act or failure to act by such Spinco described in the covenants in the Tax Sharing Agreement, (ii) acquisition of equity, securities, or assets of such Spinco or a member of its group, and (iii) breach by such Spinco or any member of its group of any representation or covenant contained in the separation documents or in the documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or tax opinions.  This indemnification remains effective until IAC's tax returns for the two year period after the spin-off are no longer subject to examination.  

NOTE 10 STOCK-BASED AWARDS 
  Stock-based compensation expense is included in the following line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $26.0 million   of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards which is currently expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of approximately   1.8   years. 
    
  The Second Amended and Restated 2008 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan, as amended (the  Plan ), authorizes the issuance of   8.0 million   shares (  8.8 million   shares after giving effect to the anti-dilution provisions of the Plan related to the special cash dividend paid in February 2015) of HSNi common stock for new awards granted by HSNi. The purpose of the Plan is to assist HSNi in attracting, retaining and motivating officers, employees, directors and consultants, and to provide HSNi with the ability to provide incentives more directly linked to the profitability of HSNi s business and increases in shareholder value.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   1.6 million   shares of common stock available for grants under the Plan. 
  During the first quarter of 2016, HSNi granted approximately   92,000   performance share units ("PSUs") to certain executive employees.  PSUs vest after a three year performance period.  PSUs have rights to receive dividend equivalents that vest concurrently with the underlying PSUs once the requisite service has been rendered.  Vesting percentages range between   0%   and   200%   of the target award based on HSNi's Total Shareholder Return relative to a peer group at the end of the  
  
   14 

performance period.  The compensation expense for these PSUs is based on the fair value of the awards measured at the grant date and is expensed ratably over the vesting term.  
  A summary of the stock-based awards granted during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is as follows:   

  The fair values of the options granted under the HSN, Inc. 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the stock appreciation rights are estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  The fair value of PSUs is estimated on the grant date using a Monte-Carlo simulation pricing model which estimates the potential outcome of reaching the market condition based on simulated future stock prices. The weighted average assumptions used in the valuation of each for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are as follows:    

NOTE 11 SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY 
  Share Repurchase Program 
  Effective January 27, 2015, HSNi s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program which allows HSNi to purchase up to   4 million   shares of its common stock from time to time through privately negotiated and/or open market transactions. The timing of repurchases and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including the stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under HSNi s debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , HSNi acquired approximately   357,000   shares of its outstanding common stock for   $16.6 million   at an average price of   $46.45  .  All shares were retired immediately following purchase.  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   2.7 million   shares remain authorized for repurchase under the program. 
  Dividend Policy 
  In the third quarter of 2016, HSNi's Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.35   per common share resulting in a payment of   $18.3 million   on September 22, 2016 to HSNi's shareholders of record as of September 7, 2016.  
  In the fourth quarter of 2016, HSNi's Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.35   per common share.  The dividend will be paid on December 20, 2016 to HSNi's shareholders of record as of December 7, 2016.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income   
  Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income includes the cumulative gains and losses of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges.  The following table provides a rollforward of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (in thousands):   

NOTE 12 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, HSNi is a party to various audits, claims and lawsuits. These audits or litigation may relate to claims involving property, personal injury, contract, intellectual property (including patent infringement), sales tax, product recalls, regulatory compliance, employment matters and other claims. HSNi has established reserves for specific legal, tax or other compliance matters for which it has determined the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management has also identified certain legal, tax or other matters where it believes an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore,   no   reserve is established. Although management currently believes that an unfavorable resolution of claims against HSNi, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on its liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future and an unfavorable resolution of such a proceeding could have a material impact. Moreover, any claims or regulatory actions against HSNi, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. 
    
  HSNi also evaluates other contingent matters, including tax contingencies, to assess the probability and estimated extent of potential loss.  See Note 9 for discussion related to income tax contingencies.   

NOTE 13 COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT ACTIVITY 
    
  As part of its supply chain optimization initiative, HSNi announced in June 2015 its plan to close the HSN distribution center in Roanoke, Virginia and expand the capabilities of its distribution center in Piney Flats, Tennessee.  The closure will involve the eventual elimination of approximately   350   positions at the Virginia facility.  HSNi expects the closure to occur in accordance with a two-year transition plan and be substantially completed in 2017. 
    
  HSN expects to incur approximately   $4 million   to   $5 million   in total charges related to the closure.  These charges include approximately   $3 million   to   $4 million   in employee-related expenses, including severance payments and retention incentives.  
    
  A summary of HSNi s liability associated with exit activities, which is recorded in  Accrued expenses and other current liabilities  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, are presented in the following table (in thousands):

NOTE 14 DIVESTITURES 
  On September 8, 2016, HSNi completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Chasing Fireflies and TravelSmith, two of the apparel brands included within the Cornerstone segment.  The sale price included   $1 million   in cash and   $2 million   of contingent consideration that is based on the achievement of certain performance metrics in 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, HSNi assigned no value to the contingent consideration as it was not considered probable of being earned.  During the third quarter of 2016, Cornerstone recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of   $11.2 million  .  The transaction included cash charges of approximately   $3.8 million   related to transactions costs and employee and lease liabilities.  As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately   $1.8 million   in exit-related liabilities that were included in "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" in the accompanying balance sheet. 
  The assets and liabilities of the two brands were classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2016 which resulted in a non-cash asset impairment charge of   $20.4 million   recorded in the second quarter of 2016.  
    
  The loss on sale and asset impairment charges related to this sale are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the line item  Loss on sale and asset impairment.    The assets sold were largely represented by   $29.3 million   of inventory and   $8.4 million   of other assets, and approximately   $8.6   million of current liabilities. 
    
  HSNi determined the sale of these businesses would not represent a strategic shift in its business nor will it have a major effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash     flows. Accordingly, the disposal group is not presented in the consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation. 

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report. Historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), which are based on management s exercise of business judgment, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management.

Results of Operations 
  Divestiture 
  On September 8, 2016, HSNi divested of TravelSmith and Chasing Fireflies, two of the apparel brands in the Cornerstone portfolio.  The results of TravelSmith of Chasing Fireflies are included in the results of HSNi and Cornerstone through the date of the divestiture.  Unless explicitly excluded, the results of TravelSmith and Chasing Fireflies are included in the discussion and analysis within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  Net Sales 
  Net sales primarily relate to the sale of merchandise, including shipping and handling fees, and are reduced by incentive discounts and actual and estimated sales returns. Sales taxes collected are not included in net sales.  Digital sales include sales placed through our websites and our mobile applications using tablets and smart phones. 
  Revenue is recorded when delivery to the customer has occurred. Delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership, which is generally on the date of shipment. HSNi s sales policy allows customers to return virtually all merchandise for a full refund or exchange, subject to pre-established time restrictions. 

HSNi net sales in the third quarter of 2016 decreased   5%  , or   $41.8 million  , due to a   3.5%   sales decline at HSN and an   8%   decline at Cornerstone.  Excluding the results of TravelSmith and Chasing Fireflies from both periods, net sales decreased 3%, or $27.4 million, in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year.  HSNi's results were also impacted by a highly promotional retail environment, the impact of a weaker season in the outdoor category and viewership distractions including the presidential election process and the Summer Olympics. HSNi expects it will continue to be impacted in the fourth quarter of 2016 by the competitive retail landscape as well as potential viewership distractions such as the presidential election process.  Digital sales, which remain a key area of strategic focus as HSNi pursues opportunities to optimize its content across multiple distributed commerce platforms, grew 2% compared to the prior year.  Digital sales penetration increased   330   basis points to   52.7%  .  Gross units shipped in the third quarter of 2016 decreased   2%   to   14.9 million   and the average price point decreased   3%   to   $61.75  . 
  HSNi net sales in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   4%  , or   $98.3 million  , due to a   3%   sales decline at HSN and a   5%   decline at Cornerstone.  Digital sales grew 2% with penetration increasing   300   basis points to   52.3%  .  Gross units shipped in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   2%   to   44.1 million   and the average price point decreased   2%   to   $62.65  .  Excluding the results of TravelSmith and Chasing Fireflies from both periods, net sales decreased 3%, or $71.4 million, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period. 
  HSN 
  HSN net sales in the   third quarter   of   2016   decreased   4%  , or   $20.9 million  .  Sales grew in apparel and accessories and wellness, primarily offset by decreases in fitness, shipping and handling revenues and electronics.  Shipping and handling revenues decreased primarily due to an increase in shipping and handling promotions and a reduction in HSN's standard shipping rates which became effective in August 2016.  A decline in shipping and handling revenues is a trend we expect to continue.  Digital sales grew   6.7%   with penetration increasing   430   basis points to   44.8%  .  The return rate improved   30   basis points from   16.8%   to   16.5%  . Units shipped increased   1%   to   11.8 million  .  Average price point decreased   5%   to   $55.64   largely due to an increase in clearance activity and changes in product mix.   
  
   19 

HSN net sales in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   3%  , or   $58.2 million  .  Sales grew in wellness, electronics, and apparel and accessories, offset by decreases in other categories and in shipping and handling revenues.  Approximately one-third of the decline in net sales was attributable to the conclusion of a direct-response television marketing campaign during the first quarter of 2016.  Shipping and handling revenues decreased primarily due to an increase in shipping and handling promotions and a reduction in HSN's standard shipping rates which became effective in August 2016.  Digital sales grew 5% and penetration increased   360   basis points to   44.1%  .  The return rate improved   60   basis points from   17.5%   to   16.9%   primarily due to a shift in sales mix to categories with lower return rates.  Units shipped were   35.0 million  , consistent with the prior year, and average price point decreased   4%   to   $55.65   driven by changes in product mix.   
  Divisional retail product sales mix at HSN is provided in the table below: 

Cornerstone 
  Cornerstone net sales in the   third quarter   of 2016 decreased   8%  , or   $20.9 million  .  Excluding the results of TravelSmith and Chasing Fireflies from both periods, net sales decreased 3%, or $6.5 million, primarily due to weakness in the outdoor category and lower catalog circulation in the home brands.  The home brands were impacted by a highly competitive environment leading to increased promotional activity to drive sales demand.  Digital sales decreased 5% but penetration increased   210   basis points to   70.4%  .  Catalog circulation decreased 10% to   73.2 million  .  Excluding the impact of TravelSmith and Chasing Fireflies, catalog circulation decreased 6% due to the strategic decision to reduce circulation in certain brands.  The return rate was   12.3%   compared to   13.1%   in the prior year primarily due to changes in product mix.  Cornerstone added three retail stores and two outlet stores with a total of 17 stores open as of September 30, 2016 compared to a total of 12 stores as of September 30, 2015. 
  Cornerstone net sales in the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016   decreased   5%  , or   $40.1 million  .  Excluding the results of TravelSmith and Chasing Fireflies from both periods, net sales decreased 2% primarily due to weakness in the outdoor category and lower catalog circulation in the home brands.  Catalog circulation was   237.6 million  , a decrease of 5% compared to prior year.  Excluding the impact of TravelSmith and Chasing Fireflies, catalog circulation decreased 2%.  Digital sales decreased 2%, but digital sales penetration increased   200   basis points to   69.9%  .  The return rate was   12.7%   compared to   13.0%   in the prior year. 
  The brand mix at Cornerstone is provided in the table below (as a percentage of net sales):

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit 
  Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of products sold, shipping and handling costs and compensation and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in supply chain functions. Cost of products sold includes merchandise cost, inbound freight and duties and certain allocable general and administrative costs, including certain warehouse costs. 

bp = basis points 
    
  HSN 
  Gross profit for HSN in the   third quarter   of 2016 decreased   7%  , or   $14.6 million  .  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased   130   basis points to   33.3%   primarily due to a decrease in shipping revenues and, to a lesser extent, increased clearance activity.  HSN continues to carry excess inventories in certain product categories that could create future margin pressure in the form of markdowns.   
  Gross profit for HSN in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   6%  , or   $35.0 million  .  Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased   80   basis points to   34.4%   primarily due to an increase in shipping promotions. 
  Cornerstone 
  Gross profit for Cornerstone in the   third quarter   of 2016 decreased   11%  , or   $11.6 million  , and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased   150   basis points to   35.6%  .  Excluding the impact of TravelSmith's and Chasing Fireflies' results from both periods, gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 90 basis points primarily due to lower product and shipping margins driven by higher promotional activity in the home brands.  
  Gross profit for Cornerstone in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   8%  , or   $26.7 million  , and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased   140   basis points to   37.4%  .  Excluding the impact of TravelSmith's and Chasing Fireflies' results from both periods, gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 120 basis points primarily due to lower product and shipping margins driven by higher promotional activity in the home brands.    
  
   21 

Selling and Marketing Expense 
  Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of advertising and promotional expenditures; compensation and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) for personnel engaged in customer service, sales and merchandising, production and programming functions; on-air distribution costs, including costs to purchase media for direct-response television marketing; and marketing partnership programs. Advertising and promotional expenditures primarily include catalog production and distribution costs and online marketing, including fees paid to search engine companies and third-party distribution partners, as well as other advertising and promotional campaigns.  Certain prior period amounts previously included in general and administrative expense have been reclassified to selling and marketing expense to conform to the current year's presentation. 

HSNi's selling and marketing expense in the   third quarter   of 2016 was   $178.8 million  , a decrease of   1%   from prior year and was   21.7%   of net sales compared to   21.0%   in the prior year.  HSNi's selling and marketing expense in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $546.0 million  , a decrease of $10.6 million from prior year, and was   21.9%   of net sales compared to   21.5%   in the prior year.  
  HSN 
  HSN's selling and marketing expense in the   third quarter   of 2016 increased   $2.0 million   compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in on-air distribution costs and digital marketing expenses, partially offset by lower employee compensation. Selling and marketing expense was   18.2%   of net sales, compared to   17.2%   in the prior year.  
  HSN's selling and marketing expense in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   $1.0 million   compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in media expense related to direct-response television marketing and lower employee compensation expense; offset by higher on-air distribution costs driven by expanded carriage of HSN2, increased advertising costs related to the expansion of HSN's wholesale business and increased digital marketing expense.  Selling and marketing expense was   18.2%   of net sales compared to   17.7%   in the prior year.  
  Cornerstone 
  Cornerstone's selling and marketing expense in the   third quarter   of 2016 decreased   $4.5 million   and was   29.6%   of net sales compared to   29.0%   in the prior year.  The decrease was due to a 10% decrease in catalog circulation, partially offset by an increase in expenses related to Cornerstone's additional retail and outlet stores.  
  Cornerstone's selling and marketing expense in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   $9.6 million   and was   29.9%   of net sales compared to   29.6%   in the prior year.  The decrease was due to a 5% decrease in catalog circulation, partially offset by an increase in expenses related to Cornerstone's additional retail and outlet stores.   

22 

General and Administrative Expense 
  General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) for personnel engaged in finance, legal, tax, human resources, information technology and executive management functions; bad debts; facilities costs; and fees for professional services.  Certain prior period amounts previously included in general and administrative expense have been reclassified to selling and marketing expense to conform to the current year's presentation. 

HSNi s general and administrative expense in the   third quarter   of 2016 decreased   17%  , or   $8.8 million  , and was   5.2%   of net sales compared to   6.0%   in the prior year.  HSNi s general and administrative expense in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   15%  , or   $23.8 million  , and was   5.6%   of net sales compared to   6.3%   in the prior year.  
  HSN 
  HSN's general and administrative expense in the   third quarter   of 2016 decreased   19%  , or   $7.3 million  , and was   5.6%   of net sales compared to   6.6%   in the prior year.  The decrease is primarily due to lower employee-related costs, particularly for performance-based incentives, and a decrease in bad debt expense. 
  HSN's general and administrative expense in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   16%  , or   $20.3 million  , and was   6.0%   of net sales compared to   7.0%   in the prior year.  The decrease is primarily due to lower employee-related costs, particularly for performance-based incentives and severance, a decrease in bad debt expense and $3.2 million in costs accrued in the prior year for the planned closure of its Virginia distribution center. 
  HSN s general and administrative expenses for 2015 include $3.2 million related to the planned closure of its Roanoke, Virginia distribution center.  The facility closure is planned to occur in 2017 as part of HSNi s supply chain optimization initiative that will include the consolidation of two distribution centers.  Additional information regarding HSNi's supply chain optimization initiative is included in the section "Operating Income (Loss)" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  As part of this initiative,  HSNi will be expanding the capabilities of its Piney Flats, Tennessee distribution center through automation of the facility.  HSNi expects to incur approximately $4 million to $5 million in total charges related to the closure of the Virginia facility.  These charges include approximately $3 million to $4 million in employee-related expenses, including severance payments and retention incentives.  See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the planned closure of the Roanoke, Virginia distribution center.   
  Cornerstone 
  Cornerstone's general and administrative expense in the   third quarter   of 2016 decreased   12%  , or   $1.5 million  , due to decreases in employee-related costs, primarily performance-based incentives.  Cornerstone's general and administrative expense was   4.3%   of net sales, compared to   4.5%   in the prior year. 
  Cornerstone's general and administrative expense in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   9%  , or   $3.5 million  , due to decreases in employee-related costs, primarily performance-based incentives, and consulting costs.  Cornerstone's general and administrative expense was   4.6%   of net sales, compared to   4.8%   in the prior year. 
  
   23 

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation and amortization in the   third quarter   of 2016 decreased   1%  , or   $0.1 million  . Depreciation and amortization in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   4%  , or   $1.2 million  .  Approximately $40.8 million in capital assets related to HSN's warehouse automation project were placed into service in September of 2016.  
  Loss on Sale and related Asset Impairment 
  During the second quarter of 2016, HSNi committed to a plan to sell Chasing Fireflies and TravelSmith, two of the apparel brands included within the Cornerstone segment.  The assets and liabilities of the two brands were classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2016 and measured at their fair values less the estimated selling costs.  As a result, Cornerstone recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of   $20.4 million   in the second quarter of 2016.   
  On September 8, 2016, Cornerstone completed the divestiture of TravelSmith and Chasing Fireflies.  In the third quarter of 2016, Cornerstone recorded a loss on sale of $11.2 million, which includes $3.8 million of cash charges related to transaction costs and employee and lease liabilities.  The sale price included $1 million in cash and a potential additional $2 million of contingent consideration that is based on the achievement of certain performance metrics in 2016.   
  Net sales for Chasing Fireflies and TravelSmith were $12.5 million and $43.6 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and were $99.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The pre-tax operating loss for the two brands, excluding asset impairment charges and the loss on sale, was approximately $4 million and $13 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. respectively, and $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Included in these results are fixed costs (approximately $7 million on an annual basis) which will be wholly or partially reabsorbed by the remaining Cornerstone brands following the divestitures.  See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Operating Income (Loss) 

HSNi's operating income in the   third quarter   of 2016, which includes a loss on the sale of $11.2 million, decreased   36%  , or   $21.0 million  , and was   4.5%   of net sales compared to   6.7%   in the prior year.  HSN's operating income in the   third quarter   of 2016 decreased   16%  , or   $9.2 million  , and was   8.2%   of net sales compared to   9.5%   in the prior year.  The decline was driven by decreases in net sales and in gross profit as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a $5.2 million decrease in operating expenses.  Cornerstone's operating loss in the   third quarter   of 2016 was   $10.1 million   compared to operating income of   $1.6 million   in the prior year.  The decrease is due to the $11.2 million loss on sale of TravelSmith and Chasing Fireflies and the lower gross profit, partially offset by the decrease in operating expenses. 
  HSNi's operating income in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   28%  , or   $52.6 million  , and was   5.3%   of net sales compared to   7.2%   in the prior year.  HSN's operating income in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016    
  
   24 

decreased 8%, or $12.9 million, and was 8.9%, compared to 9.3% the prior year.  The decline was driven by decreases in net sales and in gross profit as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses.  Cornerstone's operating loss in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was $18.8 million compared to operating income of $20.9 million in the prior year.  The decrease is due to the $11.2 million loss on the sale of TravelSmith and Chasing Fireflies recorded in the third quarter of 2016, the $20.4 million non-cash asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2016 and the $26.7 million decrease in gross profit attributable to the 5% decrease in net sales and lower gross profit rate. 
  As a part of HSNi s supply chain optimization initiative, HSN began phasing in its expanded automation capabilities in its Piney Flats, Tennessee distribution center in the third quarter.  In October, the center experienced issues in its ability to satisfy order fulfillment within traditional shipping time frames resulting in delays in merchandise deliveries.  While these delays in order fulfillment have not affected third quarter results, HSN s fourth quarter results will be impacted in the form of increased customer credits and accommodations, expedited shipping and handling costs, operating expenses and order cancellations.  Despite the delays experienced in its Piney Flats facility, the Company continues to ship substantially all of its orders within its normal time frames.   
  Based upon information available as of the date of this filing, we expect that incremental related costs, customer credits and accommodations during the fourth quarter will range from $10 million to $15 million.  Costs could exceed this range should the resolution to these matters persist into the first quarter of 2017.  We expect to realize financial and operational benefits of the supply chain optimization initiative in the form of increased labor efficiencies, more efficient space utilization, lower transportation costs and faster customer deliveries upon the project's completion. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.  Please refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the usefulness of this metric and for the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income for HSNi's operating segments and to HSNi's consolidated net income. 

HSNi's Adjusted EBITDA in the   third quarter   of 2016 decreased   19%  , or   $15.2 million  , and was   7.6%   of net sales compared to   9.0%   in the prior year.  The decline was primarily due to the decrease in net sales and decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses.  HSNi has focused on managing operating expenses through ongoing talent realignment, operational efficiencies and through strategic rationalization of Cornerstone's catalog circulation.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales (excluding non-cash charges and other non-GAAP adjustments identified in Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) were 26.4%, consistent with the prior year. 
  HSNi's Adjusted EBITDA in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   13%  , or   $30.3 million  , and was   8.5%   of net sales compared to   9.3%   in the prior year.  The decline was primarily due to the decrease in net sales and decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales (excluding non-cash charges and other non-GAAP adjustments identified in Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) were 26.9% compared to 27.1% in the prior year. 
  HSN 
  HSN's Adjusted EBITDA for the   third quarter   of 2016 decreased   14%  , or   $9.1 million  , and was   10.2%   of net sales compared to   11.4%   in the prior year.  The decline was primarily due to the decrease in net sales and decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales (excluding non-cash charges) were 23.2% compared to 23.3% in the prior year. 
  
   25 

HSN's Adjusted EBITDA for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   8%  , or   $16.5 million  , and was   10.8%   of net sales compared to   11.4%   in the prior year.  The decline was primarily due to the decrease in net sales and decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales (excluding non-cash charges and the $3.2 million charge in the prior year related to the planned closure of one of HSN's distribution centers) were 23.5% compared to 23.8% in the prior year. 
  Cornerstone 
  Cornerstone's Adjusted EBITDA for the   third quarter   of 2016 decreased   56%  , or   $6.1 million  , and was   1.9%   of net sales compared to   4.0%   in the prior year.  The decline was primarily due to a decrease in net sales and decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by improved operating expense leverage.  Operating expenses (excluding non-cash charges and the $11.2 million loss on sale) decreased $5.5 million and were 33.6% of net sales compared to 33.1% in the prior year. 
  Cornerstone's Adjusted EBITDA for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   35%  , or   $13.8 million  , and was   3.3%   of net sales compared to   4.8%   in the prior year.  The decline was primarily due to a decrease in net sales and decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses.  Operating expenses (excluding non-cash charges and the $11.2 million loss on sale) decreased $12.9 million and were 34.1% of net sales compared to 34.0% in the prior year. 
  Other Income (Expense) 

Interest expense for the   third quarter   ended   September 30, 2016   was $4.0 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year.  Interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased $0.7 million compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher average outstanding debt balance driven by the funding of a special cash dividend in February 2015 and an increase in the interest rate, partially offset by the write-off of $0.5 million of deferred financing fees in the prior year related to the credit agreement that was terminated in January 2015.   
  Income Tax Provision  
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , HSNi recorded a tax provisions   $12.7 million   and   $45.7 million  , which represents effective tax rates of   38.7%   and   37.8%  , respectively.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, HSNi recorded a tax provision of   $19.6 million   and   $64.8 million  , which represents effective tax rates of 36.4% and 37.2%, respectively.  The change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the estimated permanent tax differences for the year coupled with lower forecasted income, and as a result of adjustments related to the filing of the prior year federal income tax return.  The Company expects its annual 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 38%. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , HSNi had   $67.4 million   of cash and cash equivalents compared to   $63.9 million   as of   December 31, 2015   and   $63.2 million   as of   September 30, 2015  . 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $114.0 million   compared to   $104.9 million   in the prior year, an increase of $9.1 million, primarily due to changes in working capital related to inventories and accounts receivables.  There were lower investments in inventories in 2016 driven by the higher than planned inventory levels at the end of 2015.  The decrease in inventories as of September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 was impacted by the divestiture of TravelSmith and Chasing Fireflies in September 2016 which resulted in the sale of approximately $29.3 million of inventories.  Cash provided by accounts receivables in 2016 decreased compared to the prior year due to higher utilization and expanded offers of HSN's Flexpay offering in 2016 and the lower outstanding accounts receivable balance at the end of 2015 compared to 2014.  HSN expects to continue to use its offering of Flexpay, when appropriate, as a tool to drive profitable revenue growth. 
  
   26 

Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $29.1 million   and was related to capital expenditures primarily for investments in our distribution centers, including our warehouse automation project, information technology, Cornerstone's retail store expansion and infrastructure.   
  Net cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $81.4 million  .  Net repayments of HSNi's long-term debt during the current quarter, including for the term loan and revolving credit facility, were $8.8 million.  HSNi paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $1.05 per share in the first nine months of 2016, representing an aggregate payment of   $54.9 million  .  HSNi also paid   $16.6 million   for approximately   0.4 million   shares of common stock repurchased during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
    
  On January 27, 2015, HSNi entered into a $1.25 billion five-year syndicated Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement replaced the prior $600 million credit agreement that was set to expire in April 2017.  The Credit Agreement, which includes a $750 million revolving credit facility and a $500 million term loan, may be increased up to $1.75 billion subject to certain conditions and expires January 27, 2020. HSNi drew $500 million from its term loan and $200 million under the revolving credit facility, both under the Credit Agreement, in the first quarter of 2015 to repay in full its existing term loan of $228.1 million and to fund the $524 million special cash dividend that was paid in February 2015. 
    
  The Credit Agreement includes various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities including a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50x and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00x. HSNi was in compliance with all such covenants as of   September 30, 2016   with a leverage ratio of   1.9  x and an interest coverage ratio of   22.7  x.  The Credit Agreement also contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions to third parties, repurchase or redeem our stock, make investments, sell assets, incur liens, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.  The Credit Agreement also contains provisions that limit the ability of HSNi to make Restricted Payments, defined as cash dividends, distribution of other property, repurchase of the Company s common stock, prepayment or redemption of debt, etc., however, so long as the Company s leverage ratio is below   3.00  x after giving pro forma effect to any proposed Restricted Payments, the amount of such Restricted Payments are not limited. In the event the Company s leverage ratio is equal to or greater than   3.00  x or after giving pro forma effect to any proposed Restricted Payments, then such Restricted Payments are limited to   $150 million   in any such fiscal year. The current cash dividend of   $1.40   annually per share represents a Restricted Payment of approximately   $73.2 million  .  Dividends, loans or advances to HSNi by its subsidiaries are not restricted by the Credit Agreement.  
    
  Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a LIBOR rate plus a predetermined margin that ranges from 1.25% to 2.25% or the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a predetermined margin that ranges from 0.25% to 1.25%.  HSNi can elect to borrow at either a LIBOR rate or the Base Rate and the predetermined margin is determined by HSNi's leverage ratio. HSNi pays a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.40% (based on the leverage ratio) on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. 
  The amount available under the Credit Agreement is reduced by the amount of commercial and standby letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, which totaled $13.9 million as of   September 30, 2016  . The ability to draw funds under the revolving credit facility is dependent upon meeting the aforementioned financial covenants, which may limit HSNi s ability to draw the full amount of the facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , the additional amount that could be borrowed under the revolving credit facility, in consideration of the financial covenants and outstanding letters of credit, was approximately $586.1 million. 
  To reduce our future exposure to rising interest rates under our credit facility, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively convert $187.5 million of our variable rate term loan to a fixed-rate of 0.8525% through April 2017, and then increases to $250.0 million through January 2020 with a fixed rate of 1.05% (in both cases the swapped fixed rate is exclusive of the credit spread under the Credit Agreement).  Based on HSNi's leverage ratio as of   September 30, 2016  , the all-in fixed rate was   2.3525%  .  For additional information related to our interest rate swap, refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Effective January 27, 2015, HSNi's Board of Directors authorized a 4 million share repurchase program which allows HSNi to purchase shares of its common stock from time to time through privately negotiated and/or open market transactions. The timing of any repurchases and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including the stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under HSNi s debt obligations and other market and economic conditions.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , HSNi repurchased approximately   357,000   shares of common stock at a cost of    $16.6 million  , or an average cost of   $46.45   per share.  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   2.7 million   shares remain authorized for repurchase under the program. 
  
   27 

HSNi anticipates it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately $40 million to $45 million and primarily relate to investments in information technology, Cornerstone's retail expansion and infrastructure. HSNi s ability to fund its cash and capital needs will be affected by its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations, the overall capacity and terms of its financing arrangements as discussed above, and access to the capital markets. HSNi believes that its cash on hand, its anticipated operating cash flows, its available unused portion of the revolving credit facility and its access to capital markets will be sufficient to fund its operating needs, capital, investing and other commitments and contingencies for the foreseeable future. 
  In the fourth quarter of 2016, HSNi's Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of   $0.35   per common share.  The dividend will be paid on December 20, 2016 to HSNi's record holders as of December 7, 2016.   

Seasonality 
  HSNi is affected by seasonality, although historically our business has exhibited less seasonality than many other retail businesses.  Our sales levels are generally higher in the fourth quarter.

    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

For a description of HSNi's market risks, see  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in HSNi's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  No material changes have occurred in HSNi's market risks since   December 31, 2015  . 

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of   September 30, 2016  .

PART II 
   
                 ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal matters arising out of our operations.  These matters may relate to claims involving property, personal injury, contract, intellectual property (including patent infringement), sales tax, product recalls, regulatory compliance, employment matters and other claims.  As of the date of this filing, we are not a party to any legal proceedings that are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows; however, litigation matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty.  An unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  Moreover, any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources.   
    
  See Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part I, Item 1 for additional information regarding legal matters in which we are involved.   

ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 

See Part I. Item 1A.,  Risk Factors,  of HSNi's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , for a detailed discussion of the risk factors affecting HSNi.  There have been no material changes from the risk factors described in the annual report. 

ITEM 2. 
    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
  On January 27, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 4 million shares of our common stock, principally to offset dilution related to HSNi's equity compensation programs.  Under the terms of the share repurchase program, HSNi will repurchase its common stock from time to time through privately negotiated or open market transactions, including pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including the stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under the company s debt obligations and other market and economic conditions.  The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued by HSNi at any time. 
  Below is a summary of our common stock repurchases during the   third quarter   of   2016  :
