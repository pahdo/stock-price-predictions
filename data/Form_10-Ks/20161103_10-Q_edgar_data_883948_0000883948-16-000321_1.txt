UNION BANKSHARES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
   
   1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and follow general practice within the banking industry. Accordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements; however, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented have been made. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. 
    
  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 
    
  Business Combinations 
  On May 31, 2016, the Bank completed its acquisition of ODCM, a Charlottesville, Virginia based registered investment advisor with nearly   $300.0 million   in assets under management at the time of the acquisition. The acquisition date fair value of consideration transferred totaled   $9.1 million  , which consisted of   $4.1 million   in cash,   $453,000   in stock, and the remainder being contingent on achieving certain performance metrics. The contingent consideration is carried at fair value and is reported as a component of  Other Liabilities  in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of this liability will be assessed at each reporting period.   
    
  In connection with the transaction, the Company recorded   $4.7 million   in goodwill and   $4.5 million   of amortizable assets, which primarily relate to the value of customer relationships. The Company is amortizing these intangibles assets over the period of expected benefit, which ranges from   5   to   10   years using a straight-line method. The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair values on the acquisition date. During the current quarter, the Company finalized the valuation of certain amortizable intangible assets which increased the fair value and also impacting the recognized goodwill.  The fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition. 
    
  Loans 
  The Company originates commercial and consumer loans to customers. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is represented by commercial and residential real estate loans (including acquisition and development loans and residential construction loans) throughout its market area. The ability of the Company s debtors to honor their contracts on such loans is dependent upon the real estate and general economic conditions in those markets, as well as other factors. 
    
  Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off generally are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses, and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield using the interest method. 
    
  As of January 1, 2016, the Company enhanced the loan portfolio segmentation to better align with how the Company manages credit risk and to better align with industry practice. Below is a summary of the new loan segmentation. 
    
  Construction and Land Development     construction loans generally made to commercial and residential builders for specific construction projects. The successful repayment of these types of loans is generally dependent upon (a) a commitment for permanent financing from the Company, or (b) from the sale of the constructed property. These loans carry more risk than both types of commercial real estate term loans due to the dynamics of construction projects, changes in interest rates, the long-term financing market, and state and local government regulations. As in commercial real estate term lending, the Company manages risk by using specific underwriting policies and procedures for these types of loans and by avoiding excessive concentrations to any one business or industry. 

-  7  - 

Also, included in this category are loans generally made to residential home builders to support their lot and home inventory needs. Repayment relies upon the successful performance of the underlying residential real estate project. This type of lending carries a higher level of risk as compared to other commercial lending. This class of lending manages risks related to residential real estate market conditions, a functioning first and secondary market in which to sell residential properties, and the borrower s ability to manage inventory and run projects. The Company manages this risk by lending to experienced builders and developers by using specific underwriting policies and procedures for these types of loans and by avoiding excessive concentrations with any particular customer or geographic region. 
    
  Commercial Real Estate   Owner Occupied   - term loans made to support owner occupied real estate properties that rely upon the successful operation of the business occupying the property for repayment. General market conditions and economic activity may affect these types of loans. In addition to using specific underwriting policies and procedures for these types of loans, the Company manages risk by avoiding concentrations to any one business or industry. 
    
  Commercial Real Estate   Non-Owner Occupied   - term loans typically made to borrowers to support income producing properties that rely upon the successful operation of the property for repayment. General market conditions and economic activity may impact the performance of these types of loans. In addition to using specific underwriting policies and procedures for these types of loans, the Company manages risk by diversifying the lending to various lines of businesses, such as retail, office, office warehouse, and hotel as well as avoiding concentrations to any one business or industry. 
    
  Residential 1-4 Family     loans generally made to both commercial and residential borrowers. Mortgage loan portfolios carry risks associated with the creditworthiness of the borrower or the tenant and changes in loan-to-value ratios. The Company manages these risks through policies and procedures such as limiting loan-to-value ratios at origination, experienced underwriting, requiring standards for appraisers, and not making subprime loans. 
    
  Multifamily Real Estate     loans made to real estate investors to support permanent financing for multifamily residential income producing properties that rely on the successful operation of the property for repayment. This management mainly involves property maintenance and collection of rents due from tenants. This type of lending carries a lower level of risk as compared to other commercial lending. In addition, underwriting requirements for multifamily properties are stricter than for other non-owner-occupied property types. The Company manages this risk by avoiding concentrations with any particular customer. 
    
  Commercial and Industrial     loans generally made to support the Company s borrowers  need for equipment/vehicle purchases and short-term or seasonal cash flow needs. Repayment relies upon the successful operation of the business. This type of lending carries a lower level of commercial credit risk as compared to other commercial lending. The Company manages this risk by using general underwriting policies and procedures for these types of loans and by avoiding concentrations to any one business or industry. 
    
  HELOC     the consumer HELOC portfolio carries risks associated with the creditworthiness of the borrower and changes in loan-to-value ratios. The Company manages these risks through policies and procedures such as limiting loan-to-value ratios at origination, experienced underwriting, requiring standards for appraisers, and not making subprime loans. 
    
  Auto     the consumer indirect auto lending portfolio generally carries certain risks associated with the values of the collateral that management must mitigate. The Company focuses its indirect auto lending on one to two year old used vehicles where substantial depreciation has already occurred thereby minimizing the risk of significant loss of collateral values in the future. This type of lending places reliance on computer-based loan approval systems to supplement other underwriting standards. 
    
  Consumer and all other   - portfolios carry risks associated with the creditworthiness of the borrower and changes in the economic environment. The Company manages these risks through policies and procedures such as experienced underwriting, maximum debt to income ratios, and minimum borrower credit scores. Also included in this category are loans that generally support small business lines of credit and agricultural lending neither of which are a material source of business for the Company. 
    
  Affordable Housing Entities 
  The Company invests in private investment funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties that provide affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized amortization of   $185,000   and   $445,000  , respectively, and tax credits of $  265,000   and   $685,000  , respectively, associated with these investments within  Income tax expense  on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized amortization of   $118,000   and   $397,000  , respectively, and tax  
  
   -  8  - 

credits of  $  213,000   and   $641,000  , respectively. The carrying value of the Company s investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was   $8.0 million   and   $8.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company recorded a liability of   $5.3 million   for the related unfunded commitments as of   September 30, 2016  , which are expected to be paid from 2016 to 2019. 
    
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued revised guidance to simplify the consolidation assessment required to evaluate whether organizations should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures. The guidance also removed the indefinite deferral of specialized guidance for certain investment funds. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-02,    Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis    during the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,    Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  .  This ASU requires an entity to: (i) measure equity investments at fair value through net income, with certain exceptions; (ii) present in OCI the changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured using the fair value option; (iii) present financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset; (iv) calculate the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes based on an exit price and; (v) assess a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses of AFS debt securities in combination with other deferred tax assets. The ASU provides an election to subsequently measure certain nonmarketable equity investments at cost less any impairment and adjusted for certain observable price changes. The ASU also requires a qualitative impairment assessment of such equity investments and amends certain fair value disclosure requirements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is only permitted for the provision related to instrument-specific credit risk. The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2016-01 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842).    This ASU requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets, but recognize expenses in the income statement in a manner similar to today s accounting. The guidance also eliminates the real estate-specific provisions and changes the guidance on sale-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs, and lease executory costs for all entities. For lessors, the standard modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,    Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships  .  This ASU clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument in an existing hedging relationship would not, in and of itself, be considered a termination of the derivative instrument or a change in a critical term of the hedging relationship. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-05 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,    Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments  .  This ASU clarifies that in assessing whether an embedded contingent put or call option is clearly and closely related to the debt host, an entity is required to perform only the four-step decision sequence in ASC 815-15-25-42 (as amended by the ASU). The entity does not have to separately assess whether the event that triggers its ability to exercise the contingent option is itself indexed only to interest rates or credit risk. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has concluded the adoption of ASU 2016-06 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,    Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  .  This ASU simplifies the equity method of accounting by eliminating the requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively and early adoption is permitted. The Company has concluded the adoption of ASU 2016-07 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  .  This ASU amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations in the FASB s new revenue standard (ASU 2014-09) and clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. The ASU has the same effective date as the new revenue standard (as amended by the one-year deferral and the early adoption provisions in ASU 2015-14 delaying the effective date to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017). In addition, entities are required to adopt the ASU by using the same transition method they used to adopt the new revenue standard. The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2016-08 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,    Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted; however, if the Company elects to early adopt, then all amendments must be adopted in the same period. The Company has concluded the adoption of ASU 2016-07 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  .  This ASU amends certain aspects of the FASB s new revenue standard, specifically the standard s guidance on identifying performance obligations and the implementation guidance on licensing. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which is not yet effective. The ASU has the same effective date as the new revenue standard (as amended by the one-year deferral and the early adoption provisions in ASU 2015-14). The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2016-10 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.        This ASU amends certain aspects of the FASB's new revenue standard to reduce the potential for diversity in practice at the initial application of Topic 606 by entities with transactions that fall into the scope of this guidance, as well as reducing the cost and complexity of applying Topic 606 at the transition date and on a continual basis. The amendment affects ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , that is not yet effective. The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2016-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,    Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.         This ASU updates the existing guidance to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The amendment replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and required consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.  The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Payments (a consensus of Merging Issues Task Force)."    This ASU     attempts to clarify how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The purpose of this update is to reduce existing diversity in practice in eight areas addressed by the update. The amendment will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has concluded the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

2. SECURITIES    
    
  Available for Sale 
  The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and estimated fair values of securities available for sale as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): 

The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value (in thousands) of the Company s available for sale investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . These are aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   $85.1 million  , or   28   issues, of individual available for sale securities that had been in a continuous loss position for more than 12 months. These securities had an unrealized loss of   $1.9 million   and consisted of municipal obligations, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate bonds. As of   December 31, 2015  , there were   $46.2 million  , or   20   issues, of individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for more than 12 months. These securities had an unrealized loss of   $1.4 million   and consisted of municipal obligations, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and other securities. The Company has determined that these securities are temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for the reasons set out below: 

-  11  - 

Mortgage-backed securities.   This category s unrealized losses are primarily the result of interest rate fluctuations. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, the Company does not intend to sell the investments, and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Also, the majority of the Company s mortgage-backed securities are agency-backed securities, which have a government guarantee. 
    
  Obligations of state and political subdivisions.   This category s unrealized losses are primarily the result of interest rate fluctuations and also a certain few ratings downgrades brought about by the impact of the economic downturn on states and political subdivisions. The contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the cost basis of each investment. Because the Company does not intend to sell any of the investments and the accounting standard of  more likely than not  has not been met for the Company to be required to sell any of the investments before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 
    
  Corporate bonds.   The Company s unrealized losses in corporate debt securities are related to both interest rate fluctuations and ratings downgrades for a limited number of securities. The majority of the securities remain investment grade and the Company s analysis did not indicate the existence of a credit loss. The contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the cost basis of each investment. Because the Company does not intend to sell any of the investments before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 
    
  The following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value of available for sale securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , by contractual maturity (dollars in thousands). Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

The following table presents the estimated fair value of available for sale securities which were pledged to secure public deposits, repurchase agreements, and for other purposes as permitted or required by law as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

(1)   The "Other purposes" category consists of borrowings, derivatives, and accounts held at the Bank.

Held to Maturity 
  During the second quarter of 2015, the Company transferred securities, which it intends and has the ability to hold until maturity, with a fair value of   $201.8 million   on the date of transfer, from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. The Company transferred these securities to held to maturity to reduce the impact of price volatility on capital and in consideration of changes to the regulatory environment. The securities included net pre-tax unrealized gains of   $8.1 million   at the date of transfer with a remaining balance of   $5.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $6.8 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The Company reports securities held to maturity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at carrying value. Carrying value is amortized cost which includes any unamortized unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income prior to reclassifying the securities from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. Investment securities transferred into the held to maturity category from the available for sale category are recorded at fair value at the date of transfer. The unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of transfer is retained in accumulated other comprehensive income and in the carrying value of the securities held to maturity. Such unrealized gains/(losses) are accreted over the remaining life of the security with no impact on future net income. 
    
  The carrying value, gross unrealized gains and losses, and estimated fair values of securities held to maturity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): 

(1)   The carrying value includes   $5.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $6.8 million   as of   December 31, 2015   of net unrealized gains present at the time of transfer from available for sale securities, net of any accretion. 
    
  The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value (in thousands) of the Company s held to maturity securities with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . These are aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $661,000  , or   1   issue, of an individual held to maturity security that had been in a continuous loss position for more than 12 months. This security had an unrealized loss of   $81,000   and consisted of a municipal obligation.  The Company has determined that these securities in a loss position are temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for the reasons set out below: 
    
  Obligations of states and political subdivisions.   This category s unrealized losses are primarily the result of interest rate fluctuations and also a certain few ratings downgrades brought about by the impact of the economic downturn on states and political subdivisions. The contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the cost basis of each investment. Because the Company does not intend to sell any of the investments and the accounting standard of  more likely than not  has not been met for the Company to be required to sell any of the investments before

recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 
    
  The following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value of held to maturity securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , by contractual maturity (dollars in thousands). Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

(1)   The carrying value includes   $5.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $6.8 million   as of   December 31, 2015   of net unrealized gains present at the time of transfer from available for sale securities, net of any accretion. 
    
  The following table presents the estimated fair value of held to maturity securities which were pledged to secure public deposits as permitted or required by law as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Restricted Stock, at cost 
  Due to restrictions placed upon the Bank s common stock investment in the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB, these securities have been classified as restricted equity securities and carried at cost. These restricted securities are not subject to the investment security classifications and are included as a separate line item on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the FHLB required the Bank to maintain stock in an amount equal to   4.25%   of outstanding borrowings and a specific percentage of the Bank s total assets. The Federal Reserve Bank required the Bank to maintain stock with a par value equal to   6%   of its outstanding capital at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Restricted equity securities consist of Federal Reserve Bank stock in the amount of   $23.8 million   for both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and FHLB stock in the amount of   $39.4 million   and   $28.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Other-Than-Temporary-Impairment 
  During each quarter, the Company conducts an assessment of the securities portfolio for OTTI consideration. The assessment considers factors such as external credit ratings, delinquency coverage ratios, market price, management s judgment, expectations of future performance, and relevant industry research and analysis. An impairment is other-than-temporary if any of the following conditions exist: the entity intends to sell the security; it is more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or the entity does not expect to recover the security s entire amortized cost basis (even if the entity does not intend to sell). If a credit loss exists, but an entity does not intend to sell the impaired debt security and is not more likely than not to be required to sell before recovery, the impairment is other-than-temporary and should be separated into a credit portion to be recognized in earnings and the remaining amount relating to all other factors recognized as other comprehensive loss. Based on the assessment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and in accordance with the guidance,   no   OTTI was recognized. For the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company determined that a municipal security in the available for sale portfolio incurred credit-related OTTI of   $300,000  .  During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the municipal security was sold.  As a result, the Company recognized an additional loss on sale of the previously written down security.

Realized Gains and Losses 
  The following table presents the gross realized gains and losses on the sale of securities available for sale and the proceeds from the sale of securities during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands). The Company did not sell any investment securities that are held to maturity. 

3. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 
    
  Loans are stated at their face amount, net of deferred fees and costs, and consist of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands):

The Company measures the amount of impairment by evaluating loans either in their collective homogeneous pools or individually. The following table shows the Company s impaired loans, excluding PCI loans related to the StellarOne acquisition, by segment at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

The following tables show the average recorded investment and interest income recognized for the Company s impaired loans, excluding PCI loans related to the StellarOne acquisition, by segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands): 

-  18  - 

The Company considers TDRs to be impaired loans. A modification of a loan s terms constitutes a TDR if the creditor grants a concession that it would not otherwise consider to the borrower for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties. All loans that are considered to be TDRs are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the Company s allowance for loan loss methodology and are included in the preceding impaired loan tables. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the recorded investment in restructured loans prior to modifications was not materially impacted by the modification. 
    
  The following table provides a summary, by segment, of modified loans that continue to accrue interest under the terms of the restructuring agreement, which are considered to be performing, and modified loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, which are considered to be nonperforming, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

The Company considers a default of a restructured loan to occur when the borrower is   90 days   past due following the restructure or a foreclosure and repossession of the applicable collateral occurs. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company identified   one   loan, totaling approximately   $23,000  , that went into default that had been restructured in the twelve-month period prior to the time of default. This loan was a commercial real estate - owner occupied loan which had a term modification at a market rate. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the

The following table shows the allowance for loan loss activity, balances for allowance for loan losses, and loan balances based on impairment methodology by segment for the   nine   months ended and as of   September 30, 2016  . The table below includes the provision for loan losses. As discussed in Note 1  Accounting Policies,  the Company enhanced its loan segmentation for purposes of the allowance calculation as well as its disclosures. The impact of this enhancement is reflected in the provision amounts in the table below. In addition, a   $175,000   provision was recognized during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   for unfunded loan commitments for which the reserves are recorded as a component of  Other Liabilities  on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories (dollars in thousands):

In addition, a $  300,000   provision was recognized during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   for unfunded loan commitments. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories (dollars in thousands): 

-  22  - 

The Company uses a risk rating system and past due status as the primary credit quality indicators for the loan categories. The risk rating system on a scale of 0 through 9 is used to determine risk level as used in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses; on those loans without a risk rating, the Company uses past due status to determine risk level. The risk levels, as described below, do not necessarily follow the regulatory definitions of risk levels with the same name. A general description of the characteristics of the risk levels follows: 
    
  Pass is determined by the following criteria: 
     Risk rated 0 loans have little or no risk and are generally secured by General Obligation Municipal Credits; 
     Risk rated 1 loans have little or no risk and are generally secured by cash or cash equivalents; 
     Risk rated 2 loans have minimal risk to well qualified borrowers and no significant questions as to safety; 
     Risk rated 3 loans are satisfactory loans with strong borrowers and secondary sources of repayment; 
     Risk rated 4 loans are satisfactory loans with borrowers not as strong as risk rated 3 loans and may exhibit a greater 
  degree of financial risk based on the type of business supporting the loan; or 
     Loans that are not risk rated but that are 0 to 29 days past due. 
    
  Special Mention is determined by the following criteria: 
     Risk rated 5 loans are watch loans that warrant more than the normal level of supervision and have the possibility of an 
  event occurring that may weaken the borrower s ability to repay; 
     Risk rated 6 loans have increasing potential weaknesses beyond those at which the loan originally was granted and if 
  not addressed could lead to inadequately protecting the Company s credit position; or 
     Loans that are not risk rated but that are 30 to 89 days past due. 
    
  Substandard is determined by the following criteria: 
     Risk rated 7 loans are substandard loans and are inadequately protected by the current sound worth or paying capacity 
  of the obligor or the collateral pledged; these have well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
  with the distinct possibility the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected; or 
     Loans that are not risk rated but that are 90 to 149 days past due. 
    
  Doubtful is determined by the following criteria: 
     Risk rated 8 loans are doubtful of collection and the possibility of loss is high but pending specific borrower plans for 
  recovery, its classification as a loss is deferred until its more exact status is determined; 
     Risk rated 9 loans are loss loans which are considered uncollectable and of such little value that their continuance as 
       bankable assets is not warranted; or 
     Loans that are not risk rated but that are over 149 days past due.

The following shows changes in the accretable yield for loans accounted for under ASC 310-30,   Receivables   Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality,   for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): 

(1)     This line item represents changes in the cash flows expected to be collected due to the impact of non-credit changes such as prepayment assumptions, changes in interest rates on variable rate PCI loans, and discounted payoffs that occurred in the quarter. 
    
  The carrying value of the Company s PCI loan portfolio, accounted for under ASC 310-30, totaled   $62.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $73.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The outstanding balance of the Company s PCI loan portfolio totaled   $77.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $90.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The carrying value of the Company s acquired performing loan portfolio, accounted for under ASC 310-20,   Receivables   Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs  , totaled   $1.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   $1.4 billion   at   December 31, 2015  ; the remaining discount on these loans totaled   $18.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $20.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 

4.     INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
    
  The Company s intangible assets consist of core deposits, goodwill, and other intangibles arising from previous and current acquisitions.  The Company has determined that core deposit intangibles have finite lives and amortizes them over their estimated useful lives. Core deposit intangible assets are being amortized over the period of expected benefit, which ranges from   4   to   14 years  , using an accelerated method. On January 1, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of StellarOne and acquired intangible assets of   $29.6 million   and recorded   $234.1 million   of goodwill.  On May 31, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of ODCM and recorded goodwill of   $4.7 million   and other amortizable intangible assets of   $4.5 million  . The Company is amortizing these intangible assets over the period of expected benefit, which ranges from   5   to   10 years   using a straight-line method. During the current quarter, the Company finalized the valuation of certain amortizable intangible assets which increased the fair value and also impacting the recognized goodwill.  The fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition. 
    
  In accordance with ASC 350,   Intangibles-Goodwill and Other,   the Company reviews the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators exist. The Company performed its annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2016 and determined that there was   no   impairment to its goodwill or intangible assets. 
    
  Amortization expense of core deposit intangibles for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $1.7 million   and   $5.3 million  , respectively; and the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   totaled   $2.1 million   and   $6.4 million  , respectively.  Amortization expense of other intangibles for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $160,000  , respectively.   As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated remaining amortization expense of core deposit intangibles and other amortizable intangible assets is as follows (dollars in thousands): 

-  25  - 

5. BORROWINGS 
    
  Short-term Borrowings 
    
  The Company classifies all borrowings that will mature within a year from the date on which the Company enters into them as short-term borrowings. Total short-term borrowings consist primarily of advances from the FHLB, federal funds purchased (which are secured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions), and other lines of credit. Also included in total short-term borrowings are securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are secured transactions with customers and generally mature the day following the date sold. Total short-term borrowings consist of the following as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

The Bank maintains federal funds lines with several correspondent banks; the remaining available balance was   $169.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $175.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The Company maintains an alternate line of credit at a correspondent bank, the available balance was $  9.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and $  25.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The Company has certain restrictive covenants related to certain asset quality, capital, and profitability metrics associated with these lines and is considered to be in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, the Company had a collateral dependent line of credit with the FHLB of up to   $2.4 billion   and   $1.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Long-term Borrowings 
    
  In connection with   two   bank acquisitions prior to 2006, the Company issued trust preferred capital notes to fund the cash portion of those acquisitions, collectively totaling   $58.5 million  . In connection with the acquisition of StellarOne, the Company acquired trust preferred capital notes totaling   $32.0 million   with a remaining fair value discount of   $6.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The trust preferred capital notes currently qualify for Tier 1 capital of the Company for regulatory purposes. 

(1)The total of the trust preferred capital securities and investments in the respective trusts represents the principal asset of the Company's junior subordinated debt securities with like maturities and like interest rates to the capital securities. The Company's investment in the trusts is reported in "Other Assets" within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

-  26  - 

On August 23, 2012, the Company modified its fixed rate FHLB advances to floating rate advances, which resulted in reducing the Company s FHLB borrowing costs. In connection with this modification, the Company incurred a prepayment penalty of   $19.6 million   on the original advances, which is included as a component of long-term borrowings in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. In accordance with ASC 470-50,   Modifications and Extinguishments  , the Company is amortizing this prepayment penalty over the term of the modified advances using the effective rate method. The amortization expense is included as a component of interest expense on long-term borrowings in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. Amortization expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $474,000   and   $1.4 million   and   $463,000   and   $1.4 million  , respectively. 
    
  In connection with the StellarOne acquisition, the Company assumed   $70.0 million   in long-term borrowings with the FHLB of which there is   $45.0 million   remaining at   September 30, 2016   that had a remaining fair value premium of   $693,000  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had long-term advances from the FHLB consisting of the following (dollars in thousands): 

As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had long-term advances from the FHLB consisting of the following (dollars in thousands): 

The carrying value of the loans and securities pledged as collateral for FHLB advances totaled   $2.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $1.9 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .

6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Litigation Matters 
  In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings. Based on the information presently available, and after consultation with legal counsel, management believes that the ultimate outcome in such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of the Company. 
    
  Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
  The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the Company s involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. 
    
  The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit written is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support off-balance sheet financial instruments with credit risk. The Company considers credit losses related to off-balance sheet commitments by undergoing a similar process in evaluating losses for loans that are carried on balance sheet. The Company considers historical loss rates, current economic conditions, risk ratings, and past due status among other factors in the consideration of whether credit losses are inherent in the Company s off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit. The Company does not expect credit losses arising from off-balance sheet commitments to have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in the contracts. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Because many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
    
  Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of customers to third parties. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. 
    
  UMG, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, uses rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts during the origination process and for loans held for sale. These best efforts contracts are designed to mitigate UMG s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in connection with rate lock commitments and loans held for sale.

The following table presents the balances of commitments and contingencies (dollars in thousands): 

(1)   Includes unfunded overdraft protection. 
    
  The Company must maintain a reserve against its deposits in accordance with Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Act. For the final weekly reporting period in the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate amount of daily average required reserves was approximately   $52.7 million   and   $48.7 million  , respectively. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $49.3 million   in deposits in other financial institutions, of which   $18.8 million   and   $14.8 million   serve as collateral for the cash flow hedges and loan swaps, respectively, as discussed in Note 7  Derivatives . The Company had approximately   $14.2 million   in deposits in other financial institutions that were uninsured at   September 30, 2016  . On an annual basis, the Company s management evaluates the loss risk of its uninsured deposits in financial counterparties. 
    
  For asset/liability management purposes, the Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge various exposures or to modify the interest rate characteristics of various balance sheet accounts. See Note 7  Derivatives  for additional information. 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company records an indemnification reserve relating to the credit card portfolio and to mortgage loans previously sold based on historical statistics and loss rates; as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s indemnification reserve was approximately   $506,000   and   $450,000  , respectively.

7. DERIVATIVES  
  The Company is exposed to economic risks arising from its business operations and uses derivatives primarily to manage risk associated with changing interest rates, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship (cash flow or fair value hedge). The remaining are classified as free standing derivatives consisting of customer accommodation loan swaps and interest rate lock commitments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. 
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  The Company designates derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions on variable rate borrowings, such as trust preferred capital notes, FHLB borrowings, and prime commercial loans. The Company uses interest rate swap agreements as part of its hedging strategy by exchanging a notional amount, equal to the principal amount of the borrowings, for fixed-rate interest based on benchmarked interest rates. 
  All swaps entered into with counterparties met the Company s credit standards, and the agreements contain collateral provisions protecting the at-risk party. The Company believes that the credit risk inherent in the contract is not significant. 
  The terms and conditions of the interest rate swaps vary and amounts receivable or payable are recognized as accrued under the terms of the agreements. The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship on a periodic basis using statistical regression analysis. The Company also measures the ineffectiveness of each hedging relationship using the change in variable cash flows method which compares the cumulative changes in cash flows of the hedging instrument relative to cumulative changes in the hedged item s cash flows. In accordance with ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , the effective portions of the derivatives  unrealized gains or losses are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Based on the Company s assessment, its cash flow hedges are highly effective, but to the extent that any ineffectiveness exists in the hedge relationships, the amounts would be recorded in interest income or interest expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  On June 13, 2016, the Company terminated   three   interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges prior to their respective maturity dates. The unrealized gain of   $1.3 million   within accumulated Other Comprehensive Income will be re-classified into earnings over a   three   year period using the effective interest method.  The estimated net amount of gains expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is   $377,000  . 
  Fair Value Hedge 
  Derivatives are designated as fair value hedges when they are used to manage exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, referred to as the hedged items, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. During the normal course of business, the Company enters into interest rate swaps to convert certain long-term fixed-rate loans to floating rates to hedge the Company s exposure to interest rate risk. The Company pays a fixed interest rate to the counterparty and receives a floating rate from the same counterparty, calculated on the aggregate notional amount. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate notional amount of the related hedged items totaled   $43.5 million   and   $61.2 million  , respectively, with fair value amounts of   $3.2 million   and   $689,000  , respectively. 
  The Company applies hedge accounting in accordance with ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging,   and the fair value hedge and the underlying hedged item, attributable to the risk being hedged, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being recorded in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. Statistical regression analysis is used to assess hedge effectiveness, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. The regression analysis involves regressing the periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk. The Company s fair value hedges continue to be highly effective and had no material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income, but if any ineffectiveness exists, portions of the unrealized gains or losses would be recorded in interest income or interest expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  Loan Swaps 
  During the normal course of business, the Company enters into interest rate swap loan relationships ( loan swaps ) with borrowers to meet their financing needs. Upon entering into the loan swaps, the Company enters into offsetting positions with a third party in order to minimize interest rate risk. These back-to-back loan swaps qualify as financial derivatives, and the fair values are reported in  Other Assets  and  Other Liabilities  within the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  Interest Rate Lock Commitments 
  During the normal course of business, the Company enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding ( rate lock commitments ).  Rate lock commitments on mortgage loans that are intended to be sold in the secondary market are considered to be derivatives.  The period of time between issuance of a loan commitment, closing, and sale of the loan generally ranges from   30   to   120 days  .  The Company protects itself from changes in  
  
   -  30  - 

interest rates through the use of best efforts forward delivery commitments, whereby the Company commits to sell a loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the buyer has assumed interest rate risk on the loan.  The correlation between the rate lock commitments and the best efforts contracts is high due to their similarity. 
    
  The market values of rate lock commitments and best efforts forward delivery commitments is not readily ascertainable with precision because rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts are not actively traded in stand-alone markets. The Company determines the fair value of rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts by measuring the change in the value of the underlying asset, while taking into consideration the probability that the rate lock commitments will close. The fair value of the rate lock commitments is reported as a component of  Other Assets  in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets; the fair value of the Company s best efforts forward delivery commitments is recorded as a component of  Other Liabilities  in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any impact to income is recorded in current period earnings as a component of  Mortgage banking income, net  in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  The following table summarizes key elements of the Company s derivative instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , segregated by derivatives that are considered accounting hedges and those that are not (dollars in thousands):

The change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   is summarized as follows, net of tax (dollars in thousands): 

Reclassifications of unrealized gains (losses) on available for sale securities are reported in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income as  Gains on securities transactions, net  with the corresponding income tax effect being reflected as a component of income tax expense. The Company reported gains of   $0   and   $145,000   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $75,000   and   $672,000   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , related to the sale of securities.  The Company recorded   $300,000   in OTTI in the third quarter of 2015 on a municipal security in the available for sale portfolio.  The tax effects of the gains on sales of securities transaction, net of OTTI recorded, were   $0   and   $51,000   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $79,000   and   $130,000   during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , which amounts were included as a component of income tax expense. 
    
  Reclassifications of the change in fair value of cash flow hedges are reported in interest income and interest expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income with the corresponding income tax effect being reflected as a component of income tax expense. The Company reported net interest expense of   $237,000   and   $666,000   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $241,000   and   $723,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The tax effects of these transactions were   $83,000   and   $233,000   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $84,000   and   $253,000   during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , which were included as a component of income tax expense.

9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  The Company follows ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  , to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. This codification clarifies that fair value of certain assets and liabilities is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants. 
    
  ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 based on these two types of inputs are as follows: 
    
                   Level 1   
      
    Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 

Level 2 
      
    Valuation is based on observable inputs including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in less active markets, and model-based valuation techniques for which significant assumptions can be derived primarily from or corroborated by observable data in the markets. 

Level 3   
      
    Valuation is based on model-based techniques that use one or more significant inputs or assumptions that are unobservable in the market.  These unobservable inputs reflect the Company s assumptions about what market participants would use and information that is reasonably available under the circumstances without undue cost and effort. 

The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements. 
    
  Derivative instruments 
  As discussed in Note 7  Derivatives , the Company records derivative instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company utilizes derivative instruments as part of the management of interest rate risk to modify the re-pricing characteristics of certain portions of the Company s interest-bearing assets and liabilities. The Company has contracted with a third party vendor to provide valuations for derivatives using standard valuation techniques and therefore classifies such valuations as Level 2. Third party valuations are validated by the Company using Bloomberg Valuation Service s derivative pricing functions. The Company has considered counterparty credit risk in the valuation of its derivative assets and has considered its own credit risk in the valuation of its derivative liabilities. 
    
  During the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into interest rate lock commitments related to the origination of mortgage loans held for sale as well as best effort forward delivery commitments to mitigate interest rate risk; these instruments are recorded at estimated fair value based on the value of the underlying loan, which in turn is based on quoted prices for similar loans in the secondary market. However, this value is adjusted by a pull-through rate which considers the likelihood that the loan in a lock position will ultimately close. The pull-through rate is derived from the Company s internal data and is adjusted using significant management judgment. The pull-through rate is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock. As such, interest rate lock commitments are classified as Level 3. An increase in the pull-through rate utilized in the fair value measurement of the interest rate lock commitment derivative will result in positive fair value adjustments while a decrease in the pull-through rate will result in a negative fair value adjustment. The Company s weighted average pull-through rate was approximately   80%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate lock commitments are recorded as a component of  Other Assets  on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Securities available for sale 
  Securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices, when available (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data (Level 2). If the inputs used to provide the evaluation for certain securities are unobservable and/or there is little, if any, market activity, then the security would fall to the lowest level of the hierarchy (Level 3). 

-  34  - 

The Company s investment portfolio is primarily valued using fair value measurements that are considered to be Level 2. The Company has contracted with a third party portfolio accounting service vendor for valuation of its securities portfolio. The vendor s primary source for security valuation is Interactive Data Corporation ( IDC ), which evaluates securities based on market data. IDC utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and include available trade, bid, and other market information. Generally, the methodology includes broker quotes, proprietary models, vast descriptive terms and conditions databases, as well as extensive quality control programs. 
    
  The vendor utilizes proprietary valuation matrices for valuing all municipals securities. The initial curves for determining the price, movement, and yield relationships within the municipal matrices are derived from industry benchmark curves or sourced from a municipal trading desk. The securities are further broken down according to issuer, credit support, state of issuance, and rating to incorporate additional spreads to the industry benchmark curves. 
    
  The Company primarily uses Bloomberg Valuation Service, an independent information source that draws on quantitative models and market data contributed from over   4,000   market participants, to validate third party valuations. Any material differences between valuation sources are researched by further analyzing the various inputs that are utilized by each pricing source. No material differences were identified during the validation as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The carrying value of restricted Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of each entity and is therefore excluded from the following table. 
    
  Loans held for sale 
  Loans held for sale are carried at fair value. These loans currently consist of residential loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Fair value is based on the price secondary markets are currently offering for similar loans using observable market data which is not materially different than cost due to the short duration between origination and sale (Level 2). Gains and losses on the sale of loans are recorded within the mortgage segment and are reported on a separate line item in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. 

-  35  - 

The following table presents the balances of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

-  36  - 

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 
    
  The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the financial statements. 
    
  Impaired loans 
  Loans are designated as impaired when, in the judgment of management based on current information and events, it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements will not be collected. The measurement of loss associated with impaired loans can be based on either the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral. Collateral dependent loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is solely from the underlying value of the collateral. Collateral may be in the form of real estate or business assets including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. The vast majority of the Company s collateral is real estate. The value of real estate collateral is determined utilizing an income or market valuation approach based on an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser using observable market data. When evaluating the fair value, management may discount the appraisal further if, based on their understanding of the market conditions, it is determined the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value (Level 3). For the periods ending   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Level 3 weighted averages related to impaired loans were   12.4%   and   7.0%  , respectively. The value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal, of one year or less, if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable business s financial statements if not considered significant using observable market data. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivables collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports (Level 3). Collateral dependent impaired loans allocated to the allowance for loan losses are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for loan losses on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  Other real estate owned 
  OREO is evaluated for impairment at least quarterly by the Bank s Special Asset Loan Committee and any necessary write downs to fair values are recorded as impairment and included as a component of noninterest expense. Fair values of OREO are carried at fair value less selling costs. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral, or management s estimation of the value of the collateral. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the Company records the foreclosed asset as Level 3 valuation. For the nine and twelve month periods ending   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Level 3 weighted averages related to OREO were approximately   24.7%   and   32.0%  , respectively. 
    
  Total valuation expenses related to OREO properties for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   totaled   $479,000   and   $879,000   and   $473,000   and   $1.8 million  , respectively. 

-  37  - 

The following tables summarize the Company s financial assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

ASC 825,   Financial Instruments,   requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments for interim periods and excludes certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents 
  For those short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
    
  Held to Maturity Securities 
  The Company s investment portfolio is primarily valued using fair value measurements that are considered to be Level 2. The Company has contracted with a third party portfolio accounting service vendor for valuation of its securities portfolio. The vendor s primary source for security valuation is IDC, which evaluates securities based on market data. IDC utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and include available trade, bid, and other market information. Generally, the methodology includes broker quotes, proprietary models, vast descriptive terms and conditions databases, as well as extensive quality control programs. 
    
  The vendor utilizes proprietary valuation matrices for valuing all municipals securities. The initial curves for determining the price, movement, and yield relationships within the municipal matrices are derived from industry benchmark curves or sourced from a municipal trading desk. The securities are further broken down according to issuer, credit support, state of issuance, and rating to incorporate additional spreads to the industry benchmark curves. 
    
  The Company primarily uses Bloomberg Valuation Service, an independent information source that draws on quantitative models and market data contributed from over   4,000   market participants, to validate third party valuations. Any material differences between valuation sources are researched by further analyzing the various inputs that are utilized by each pricing source. No material differences were identified during the validation as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

-  38  - 

Loans 
  The fair value of performing loans is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a yield curve that is constructed by adding a loan spread to a market yield curve. Loan spreads are based on spreads currently observed in the market for loans of similar type and structure. Fair value for impaired loans and their respective level within the fair value hierarchy, are described in the previous disclosure related to fair value measurements of assets that are measured on a nonrecurring basis. 
    
  Bank owned life insurance 
  The carrying value of bank owned life insurance approximates fair value. The Company records these policies at their cash surrender value, which is estimated using information provided by insurance carriers. 
    
  Deposits 
  The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 
    
  Borrowings 
  The carrying value of the Company s repurchase agreements is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Other borrowings are discounted using the current yield curve for the same type of borrowing. For borrowings with embedded optionality, a third party source is used to value the instrument. The Company validates all third party valuations for borrowings with optionality using Bloomberg s derivative pricing functions. 
    
  Accrued interest 
  The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value. 

-  39  - 

The carrying values and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows (dollars in thousands): 

-  40  - 

The Company assumes interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, the fair values of the Company s financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Company. Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk. However, borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment. Conversely, depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment. Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the Company s overall interest rate risk.

10. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, including the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding attributable to stock awards. 
    
  There were approximately   118   and   51,179   shares underlying anti-dilutive awards for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and there were approximately   579   and   54,475   shares underlying anti-dilutive awards for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Anti-dilutive awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. 
    
  The following is a reconciliation of the denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands except per share data):

11. SEGMENT REPORTING DISCLOSURES    
    
  The Company has   two   reportable segments: a traditional full service community bank segment and a mortgage loan origination business segment. The community bank segment includes   one   subsidiary bank, the Bank, which provides loan, deposit, investment, and trust services to retail and commercial customers throughout its   115   retail locations in Virginia as of September 30, 2016. The mortgage segment includes UMG, which provides a variety of mortgage loan products principally in Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland, and the Washington D.C. metro area. These loans are originated and sold primarily in the secondary market through purchase commitments from investors, which serves to mitigate the Company s exposure to interest rate risk. 
    
  Profit and loss is measured by net income after taxes including realized gains and losses on the Company s investment portfolio. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Inter-segment transactions are recorded at cost and eliminated as part of the consolidation process. 
    
  Both of the Company s reportable segments are service-based. The mortgage business is a primarily fee-based business, while the Bank is driven principally by net interest income. The bank segment provides a distribution and referral network through its customers for the mortgage loan origination business. The mortgage segment offers a more limited referral network for the bank segment. 
    
  The community bank segment provides the mortgage segment with the short-term funds needed to originate mortgage loans through a warehouse line of credit and charges the mortgage banking segment interest. The interest rate on the warehouse line of credit for each of the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was the three month LIBOR rate plus   0.15%   with   no   floor. These transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. 
    
  During 2015, the mortgage segment began originating loans with the intent that they be held for investment purposes. The community bank segment provides the mortgage segment with the long-term funds needed to originate these loans through a long-term funding facility and charges the mortgage segment interest. The interest charged is determined by the community bank segment based on the cost of funds available to the community bank segment for similar durations of the loans being funded by the mortgage segment. 
    
  A management fee for operations and administrative support services is charged to all subsidiaries and eliminated in the consolidated totals.

Review Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
    
  The Stockholders and Board of Directors of Union Bankshares Corporation 
    
  We have reviewed the consolidated balance sheet of Union Bankshares Corporation (the  Company ) as of September 30, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders  equity and cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. 
    
  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
  We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, not presented herein, and we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements in our report dated February 25, 2016. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2015, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Executive Overview 
  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported net income of $20.4 million and earnings per share of $0.47. These results represent an increase of $2.2 million, or 12.0%, from $18.2 million in earnings from the third quarter of 2015. Earnings per share of $0.47 for the current quarter represent an increase of $0.07, or 17.5%, in earnings per share from the third quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to increases in net interest income, driven by increased loan production and higher average loan balances, and higher overall noninterest income. 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported net income of $56.7 million and earnings per share of $1.29. These results represent an increase of $7.4 million, or 15.1%, from $49.3 million in earnings from the first nine months of 2015. Earnings per share of $1.29 for the current nine-month period represent an increase of $0.20, or 18.3%, in earnings per share from the first nine months of 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to increases in net interest income, driven by increased loan production and higher average loan balances, and higher overall noninterest income. 

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company closed five in-store branches as part of its continuing efforts to become more efficient.  The Company incurred approximately $400,000 in related branch closure costs. 
                  
    Asset quality continued to improve as nonperforming assets and past due loan levels continued to decline.

Net Interest Income 

(1)   Core metrics exclude the impact of acquisition accounting accretion and amortization adjustments in net interest income. 
    
  For the third quarter of 2016, tax-equivalent net interest income was $69.5 million, an increase of $3.7 million from the third quarter of 2015, primarily driven by higher average loan balances. Net accretion related to acquisition accounting decreased $86,000 from the third quarter of 2015 to $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2016. The third quarter 2016 tax-equivalent net interest margin decreased by 10 basis points to 3.76% compared to 3.86% in the comparable quarter in the prior year. Core tax-equivalent net interest margin (which excludes the 9 basis point impact of acquisition accounting accretion in the both third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2015) decreased by 10 basis points to 3.67% in the third quarter of 2016 from 3.77% in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in core tax-equivalent net interest margin was driven by the 8 basis point decline in interest-earning asset yields and the 2 basis point increase in cost of funds. The decline in interest-earning asset yields was primarily driven by lower loan yields, as new and renewed loans were originated and re-priced at lower rates, as well as lower levels of fees on loans.

(1)   Core metrics exclude the impact of acquisition accounting accretion and amortization adjustments in net interest income. 
    
  For the first nine months of 2016, tax-equivalent net interest income was $203.9 million, an increase of $7.9 million from the same period of 2015, primarily driven by higher average loan balances. Net accretion related to acquisition accounting decreased $1.2 million from the first nine months of 2015 to $4.1 million in the first nine months of 2016. The tax-equivalent net interest margin decreased by 13 basis points to 3.80% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 3.93% in the comparable period in the prior year. Core tax-equivalent net interest margin (which excludes the 7 basis point impact of acquisition accounting accretion in the first nine months of 2016 and 11 basis points in the first nine months of 2015) decreased by 9 basis points to 3.73% for the first nine months of 2016 from 3.82% for the first nine months of 2015. The decrease in core tax-equivalent net interest margin was due to the 9 basis point decline in interest-earning asset yields, which was primarily driven by lower loan yields, as new and renewed loans were originated and re-priced at lower rates, as well as lower levels of fees on loans.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, noninterest income increased   $2.2 million  , or   13.3%  , to $  19.0 million   from $  16.7 million   for the third quarter of 2015. Customer-related fee income increased $414,000 primarily due to higher debit card interchange and letter of credit fees.  Mortgage banking income increased $577,000 related to higher mortgage loan originations. Fiduciary and asset management fees also increased by $540,000 when compared to the same quarter in the prior year, due to the acquisition of ODCM.

Customer-related fee income increased $2.0 million due to higher overdraft, debit card interchange, and letter of credit fees. Bank owned life insurance increased $  691,000   compared to the prior year due to increased investments in bank owned life insurance at the end of 2015, and other operating income increased $  1.2 million  , primarily related to higher loan-related interest rate swap fees. Mortgage banking income increased $742,000 related to higher gain on sale margins.

(1) OREO related costs include foreclosure related expenses, gains/losses on the sale of OREO, valuation reserves, and asset resolution related legal expenses. 
    
  For the quarter ended   September 30,     2016  , noninterest expense increased   $3.6 million  , or   6.7%  , to   $56.9 million   from   $53.3 million   for the third quarter of 2015. Salaries and benefits expense increased   $4.6 million   primarily related to annual merit adjustments as well as increases in incentive compensation and benefit-related costs. Technology and software costs increased $  368,000   due to investments in infrastructure to support the Company's growth. The majority of declines in noninterest expense were related to decreases in OREO and credit-related costs of $760,000 related to lower property and legal-related expenses as well as higher gains on sales of OREO. Other declines in noninterest expenses were related to a decrease in furniture and equipment expenses of $380,000, related to lower depreciation and equipment maintenance expenses, and lower core deposit intangible amortization expense of $391,000.

For the nine months ended   September 30,     2016  , noninterest expense increased   $4.0 million   to   $166.4 million   from   $162.4 million   when compared to the first nine months of 2015. Salaries and benefits expense increased   $8.2 million   primarily related to annual merit adjustments as well as increases in incentive and equity-based compensation and benefit-related costs; the increase in salaries also relates to investments in key positions to support the Company's long-term growth strategy. Professional fees increased   $1.4 million   due to higher project-related consulting expenses, and technology and software costs increased   $1.3 million   due to investments in infrastructure to support the Company's growth. These increases were partially offset by declines in OREO and credit-related costs of $2.5 million related to lower valuation adjustments and property and legal-related fees as well as gains on sales of OREO compared to losses in 2015.  Additional declines in noninterest expenses were related to lower core deposit intangible amortization expense of $1.1 million, a decrease in furniture and equipment expenses of $951,000 primarily related to lower depreciation expenses, lower occupancy expenses of $593,000 due to lower rental expenses, a decline in communications expenses of $517,000, and lower printing costs of $404,000.

Mortgage Segment 
    
  The mortgage segment reported net income of   $785,000   for the third quarter of 2016, an improvement of $726,000 from net income of   $59,000   in the third quarter of 2015. The improvement was primarily due to increased mortgage banking income, net of commissions, of $577,000, related to increases in mortgage loan originations.  Mortgage loan originations increased $8.6 million, or 5.8%, from $148.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to $156.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Noninterest expense decreased $121,000, largely a result of cost control initiatives in personnel costs.  
    
  The mortgage segment reported net income of   $1.4 million   for the first nine months of 2016, an improvement of $1.5 million from a net loss of   $113,000   in the first nine months of 2015. The improvement was primarily due to a reduction in noninterest expense of $969,000, largely a result of cost control initiatives in personnel costs as well as lower volume-driven expenses. Mortgage banking income, net of commissions, increased $742,000 to $8.3 million in the first nine months of 2016 due to increased gain on sale margins, despite lower origination volume of $32.1 million, or 7.5%, as volume declined from $427.1 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $395.0 million for the first nine months of 2016. 

Income Taxes 
    
  The provision for income taxes is based upon the results of operations, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses. In addition, certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate. 
    
  In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversal of temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. Management continues to believe that it is not likely that the Company will realize its deferred tax asset related to net operating losses generated at the state level and accordingly has established a valuation allowance. The Company s bank subsidiary is not subject to a state income tax in its primary place of business (Virginia). The Company s other subsidiaries are subject to state income taxes and have generated losses for state income tax purposes which the Company is currently unable to utilize. State net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire after 2026. 
    
  The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 23.3% and 26.5%, respectively; the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 25.0% and 26.7%, respectively.  The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily related to historic tax credits realized in the third quarter of 2016 related to the Company's investment in a historic rehabilitation project that was completed.

continued run-off in time deposits.  Quarterly average deposits increased $390.8 million, or 6.7%, from the same quarter in the prior year. For further discussion on this topic, see  Deposits  below. 
  The Company s short term borrowings generally include secured financing transactions, such as customer repurchase agreements, advances from the FHLB, and other lines of credit. Short-term borrowings at   September 30, 2016   were   $665.7 million  , an increase of $276.7 million from   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to an increase in FHLB advances. For additional information on the Company s borrowings activity, please refer to Note 5  Borrowings  in Part I, Item 1   Financial Statements, of this report. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , stockholders  equity was   $1.0 billion  , an increase of $5.6 million from   $995.4 million   reported at   December 31, 2015  . The Company s capital ratios continue to exceed the minimum capital requirements for regulatory purposes but have decreased from prior periods primarily due to share repurchases and asset growth. The total risk-based capital ratios at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   11.60%   and   12.46%  , respectively. The Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios were   11.07%   and   11.93%   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios were   9.78%   and   10.55%   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company s common equity to total asset ratios at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   12.12%   and   12.94%  , respectively, while its tangible common equity to tangible assets ratios were   8.57%   and   9.20%  , respectively, at the same dates. 
    
  On October 29, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to purchase up to $25.0 million worth of the Company s common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This share repurchase program was completed in February 19, 2016. On February 25, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to purchase up to $25.0 million worth of the Company s common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The Company repurchased approximately   1.4 million   shares during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and had approximately   $13.0 million   available for repurchase under the current program. 
    
  Also, the Company declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.19 per share during the third quarter of 2016, consistent with the dividend paid in the prior quarter, and an increase of $0.02 per share, or 11.8%, compared to the dividend paid during the same quarter in the prior year. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company paid dividends of   $0.57  , which is an increase of $0.08 or 16.3% compared to the dividends paid during the first nine months of 2015. 

Securities 
  At September 30, 2016, the Company had total investments in the amount of $1.2 billion, or 14.8% of total assets, as compared to $1.2 billion, or 15.1% of total assets, at December 31, 2015. The Company seeks to diversify its portfolio to minimize risk. It focuses on purchasing mortgage-backed securities for cash flow and reinvestment opportunities and securities issued by states and political subdivisions due to the tax benefits and the higher yield offered from these securities. The majority of the Company s mortgage-backed securities are investment grade. The investment portfolio has a high percentage of municipals and mortgage-backed securities; therefore a higher taxable equivalent yield exists on the portfolio compared to its peers. The Company does not engage in structured derivative or hedging activities within the investment portfolio. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2015, the Company transferred securities, which it intends and has the ability to hold until maturity, with a fair value of $201.8 million on the date of transfer, from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. The Company transferred these securities to held to maturity to reduce the impact of price volatility on capital and in consideration of changes to the regulatory environment. The securities included net pre-tax unrealized gains of $8.1 million at the date of transfer with a remaining balance of $5.6 million as of September 30, 2016 and   $6.8 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .

The table below sets forth a summary of the securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, and restricted stock for the following periods (dollars in thousands):  

During each quarter and at year end, the Company conducts an assessment of the securities portfolio for OTTI consideration. No OTTI was recognized for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company determined that a municipal security in the available for sale portfolio incurred credit-related OTTI of $300,000. During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the municipal security was sold.  As a result, the Company recognized an additional loss on sale of the previously written down security. The Company monitors the portfolio, which is subject to liquidity needs, market rate changes, and credit risk changes, to determine whether adjustments are needed. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

  As of September 30, 2016, the Company maintained a diversified municipal bond portfolio with approximately 75% of its holdings in general obligation issues and the remainder backed by revenue bonds. Issuances within the State of Texas represented 12%, the State of Washington represented 12%, and the Commonwealth of Virginia represented 12% of the municipal portfolio; no other state had a concentration above 10%. Substantially all municipal holdings are considered investment grade by Moody s or Standard   Poor s. The non-investment grade securities are principally insured Texas municipalities with no underlying rating.  When purchasing municipal securities, the Company focuses on strong underlying ratings for general obligation issuers or bonds backed by essential service revenues. 

Liquidity 
  Liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with banks, money market investments, federal funds sold, securities available for sale, loans held for sale, and loans maturing or re-pricing within one year. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Company include its capacity to borrow additional funds when necessary through federal funds lines with several correspondent banks, a line of credit with the FHLB, the purchase of brokered certificates of deposit, and a corporate line of credit with a large correspondent bank. Management considers the Company s overall liquidity to be sufficient to satisfy its depositors  requirements and to meet its customers  credit needs. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the cash, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, money market investments, federal funds sold, loans held for sale, and loans that mature within one year totaled $2.1 billion, or 27.8%, of total earning assets. As of September 30, 2016, approximately $1.9 billion, or 30.2%, of total loans are scheduled to mature within one year based on contractual maturity, adjusted for expected prepayments. 

Loan Portfolio 
    
  Loans, net of deferred fees and costs, were $6.1 billion at September 30, 2016, $5.7 billion at December 31, 2015, and $5.5 billion at September 30, 2015. Loans secured by real estate continue to represent the Company s largest category, comprising 81.0% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2016.

The following table presents the remaining maturities, based on contractual maturity, by loan type and by rate type (variable or fixed), as of September 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands): 

While the current economic environment is challenging, the Company remains committed to originating soundly underwritten loans to qualifying borrowers within its markets. The Company is focused on providing community-based financial services and discourages the origination of portfolio loans outside of its principal trade areas. As reflected in the loan table, at September 30, 2016, the largest component of the Company s loan portfolio consisted of real estate loans, concentrated in commercial, construction, and residential 1-4 family. The risks attributable to these concentrations are mitigated by the Company s credit underwriting and monitoring processes, including oversight by a centralized credit administration function and credit policy and risk management committee, as well as seasoned bankers focusing their lending to borrowers with proven track records in markets with which the Company is familiar. UMG serves as a mortgage brokerage operation, selling the majority of its loan production in the secondary market or selling loans to meet the Bank s current asset/liability management needs.

Asset Quality 
    
  Overview 
  During the first nine months of 2016, the Company experienced declines in nonperforming assets and total past due loan levels from December 31, 2015.  OREO balances declined significantly from the prior year primarily as a result of sales of foreclosed property.  Net charge-off levels were lower compared to the prior year due to improving asset quality. The allowance for loan losses increased from December 31, 2015 due to loan growth in 2016. 
    
  Troubled Debt Restructurings 
  The total recorded investment in TDRs as of September 30, 2016 was   $13.3 million  , an increase of $575,000, or 4.5%, from   $12.7 million   at December 31, 2015 and an increase of $1.7 million, or 14.9%, from $11.6 million at September 30, 2015. Of the $13.3 million of TDRs at September 30, 2016,   $11.8 million  , or 89.1%, were considered performing while the remaining   $1.5 million   were considered nonperforming. Loans removed from TDR status represent restructured loans with a market rate of interest at the time of the restructuring. These loans have performed in accordance with their modified terms for twelve consecutive months and were no longer considered impaired. Loans removed from TDR status are collectively evaluated for impairment; due to the significant improvement in the expected future cash flows, these loans are grouped based on their primary risk characteristics, typically using the Company s internal risk rating system as its primary credit quality indicator. Impairment is measured based on historical loss experience taking into consideration environmental factors. The significant majority of these loans have been subject to new credit decisions due to the improvement in the expected future cash flows, the financial condition of the borrower, and other factors considered during re-underwriting. The TDR activity during the quarter did not have a material impact on the Company s allowance for loan losses, financial condition, or results of operations. 
    
  Nonperforming Assets 
  At September 30, 2016, nonperforming assets totaled $23.3 million, a decrease of $4.0 million, or 14.6%, from December 31, 2015 and a decline of $11.8 million, or 33.7%, from a year ago. In addition, NPAs as a percentage of total outstanding loans decreased 10 basis points to 0.38% in the current quarter from 0.48% as of December 31, 2015 and declined 25 basis points from 0.63% a year earlier. All nonaccrual and past due loan metrics discussed below exclude PCI loans, which totaled $62.3 million (net of fair value mark of $15.6 million) at September 30, 2016. 

-  61  - 

The following table shows a summary of asset quality balances and related ratios as of and for the quarters ended (dollars in thousands): 

Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2016 included $12.7 million in nonaccrual loans, a net increase of $741,000, or 6.2%, from December 31, 2015 and a net decrease of $289,000, or 2.2%, from September 30, 2015. The following table shows the activity in nonaccrual loans for the quarter ended (dollars in thousands): 

The additions to nonaccrual loans in the third quarter of 2016 were comprised of several smaller credit relationships, the majority of which were construction and commercial   industrial loans as well as loans secured by residential 1-4 family property.

Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2016 also included $10.6 million in OREO, a decrease of $4.7 million, or 30.8%, from December 31, 2015 and a decrease of $11.5 million, or 52.1%, from the prior year. The following table shows the activity in OREO for the quarters ended (dollars in thousands): 

During the third quarter of 2016, the majority of sales of OREO were related to land and residential real estate. 
    
  The following table presents the composition of the OREO portfolio at the quarter ended (dollars in thousands):

  Past Due Loans 
  At September 30, 2016, total accruing past due loans were $26.9 million, or 0.44% of total loans, compared to $42.9 million, or 0.76%, at December 31, 2015 and $27.5 million, or 0.50%, a year ago. At September 30, 2016, loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $3.5 million, or 0.06% of total loans, compared to $5.8 million, or 0.10%, at December 31, 2015 and $5.2 million, or 0.09%, a year ago. 
    
  Charge-offs and delinquencies 
  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, net charge-offs were $929,000, or 0.06% of average loans on an annualized basis, compared to $1.0 million, or 0.07%, for the same quarter last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net charge- 
  
   -  63  - 

offs were $4.7 million, or 0.11% on an annualized basis, compared to $6.4 million, or 0.15%, for the same period last year. The decrease in net charge-off levels is attributable to improving asset quality. The majority of net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2016 were related to HELOCs and loans secured by residential 1-4 family property. 
    
  Provision 
  The provision for loan losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $2.4 million, an increase of $435,000 compared to the same quarter a year ago. This increase in loan loss provision is primarily related to loan growth.  The provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $7.2 million, a decrease of $60,000 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Despite the loan growth that has occurred during the year, the decline in provision for loan losses in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily driven by lower charge-off levels and improving asset quality metrics. 
    
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
  The allowance for loan losses of $36.5 million at September 30, 2016, is an increase of $2.5 million compared to the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of the total loan portfolio, unadjusted for acquisition accounting, was 0.59% at September 30, 2016 and 0.60% at both December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2015. The ALL as a percentage of the total loan portfolio, adjusted for acquisition accounting (non-GAAP), was 0.90% at September 30, 2016, a decrease from 0.98% at December 31, 2015 and 1.01% at September 30, 2015. In acquisition accounting, there is no carryover of previously established allowance for loan losses, as acquired loans are recorded at fair value. 
    
  The nonaccrual loan coverage ratio was 288.3% at September 30, 2016, compared to 285.3% at December 31, 2015, and 256.6% at September 30, 2015. The current level of the allowance for loan losses reflects specific reserves related to nonperforming loans, current risk ratings on loans, net charge-off activity, loan growth, delinquency trends, and other credit risk factors that the Company considers important in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.

Deposits 
  As of September 30, 2016, total deposits were   $6.3 billion  , an increase of $294.6 million, or 6.6% (annualized), from December 31, 2015. Total interest-bearing deposits consist of NOW, money market, savings, and time deposit account balances. Total time deposit balances of $1.2 billion accounted for 24.6% of total interest-bearing deposits at September 30, 2016. 
    
  The following table presents the deposit balances by major categories as of the quarters ended (dollars in thousands): 

The Company may also borrow additional funds by purchasing certificates of deposit through a nationally recognized network of financial institutions. The Company utilizes this funding source when rates are more favorable than other funding sources. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have purchased certificates of deposit included in certificates of deposit on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Maturities of time deposits as of September 30, 2016 are as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Capital Resources 
    
  Capital resources represent funds, earned or obtained, over which financial institutions can exercise greater or longer control in comparison with deposits and borrowed funds. The adequacy of the Company s capital is reviewed by management on an ongoing basis with reference to size, composition, and quality of the Company s resources and consistency with regulatory requirements and industry standards. Management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses, yet allow management to effectively leverage its capital to maximize return to shareholders.

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve issued final rules to include technical changes to its market risk capital rules to align them with the Basel III regulatory capital framework and meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Effective January 1, 2015, the final rules require the Company and the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets (increased from the prior requirement of 4.0%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged from the prior requirement); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0% of total assets (unchanged from the prior requirement). These capital requirements will be phased in over a four-year period. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the rules will require the Company and the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5%  capital conservation buffer  (which is added to the 4.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation), and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. 
    
  Beginning January 1, 2016, the capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, and will increase by the same amount each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The table summarizes the Company s regulatory capital and related ratios for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): 

(1)   Calculated by subtracting the regulatory minimum capital ratio requirements from the Company's actual ratio results for Common equity, Tier 1, and Total risk based capital. The lowest of the three measures represents the Company's capital conservation buffer ratio. 

NON-GAAP MEASURES 
    
  In reporting the Company s results as of and for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has provided supplemental performance measures on a tangible basis. Tangible common equity is used in the calculation of certain capital and per share ratios. The Company believes tangible common equity and the related ratios are meaningful measures of capital adequacy because they provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which the Company believes will assist investors in assessing the capital of the Company and its ability to absorb potential losses. 

-  66  - 

These measures are a supplement to U.S. GAAP used to prepare the Company s financial statements and should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. In addition, the Company s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures of other companies. 
    
  The following table reconciles these non-GAAP measures from their respective U.S. GAAP basis measures for each of the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 

The allowance for loan losses ratio, adjusted for acquisition accounting (non-GAAP), includes an adjustment for the fair value mark on acquired performing loans. The acquired performing loans are reported net of the related fair value mark in loans, net of deferred fees and costs, on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets; therefore, the fair value mark is added back to the balance to represent the total loan portfolio. The adjusted allowance for loan losses, including the fair value mark, represents the total reserve on the Company s loan portfolio. The PCI loans, net of the respective fair value mark, are removed from the loans, net of deferred fees and costs, as these PCI loans are not covered by the allowance established by the Company unless changes in expected cash flows indicate that one of the PCI loan pools is impaired, at which time an allowance for PCI loans will be established. U.S. GAAP requires the acquired allowance for loan losses not be carried over in an acquisition or merger. The Company believes the presentation of the allowance for loan losses ratio, adjusted for acquisition accounting, is useful to investors because the acquired loans were purchased at a market discount with no allowance for loan losses carried over to the Company, and the fair value mark on the purchased performing loans represents the allowance associated with those purchased loans. The Company believes that this measure is a better reflection of the reserves on the Company s loan portfolio. The following table shows the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of the total loan portfolio, adjusted for acquisition accounting, as of the quarters ended (dollars in thousands): 

ITEM 3   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices. The Company s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk. The ALCO of the Company is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the Company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this risk. The Company s Board of Directors reviews and approves the guidelines established by ALCO. 
  
   -  67  - 

Interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complementary modeling tools: static gap analysis, earnings simulation modeling, and economic value simulation (net present value estimation). Each of these models measures changes in a variety of interest rate scenarios. While each of the interest rate risk models has limitations, taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the Company, the distribution of risk along the yield curve, the level of risk through time, and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships. Static gap, which measures aggregate re-pricing values, is less utilized because it does not effectively measure the options risk impact on the Company and is not addressed here. Earnings simulation and economic value models, which more effectively measure the cash flow and optionality impacts, are utilized by management on a regular basis and are explained below. 
    
  The Company determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies and practices governing asset generation and pricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments. These decisions are based on management s expectations regarding future interest rate movements, the states of the national, regional, and local economies, and other financial and business risk factors. The Company uses simulation modeling to measure and monitor the effect of various interest rate scenarios and business strategies on net interest income. This modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income and net income over specified time horizons. 
    
  EARNINGS SIMULATION ANALYSIS 
    
  Management uses simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates. The model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates. This method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process, but it provides a better analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analyses, such as the static gap analysis discussed above. 
    
  Assumptions used in the model are derived from historical trends and management s outlook and include loan and deposit growth rates and projected yields and rates. Such assumptions are monitored by management and periodically adjusted as appropriate. All maturities, calls, and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments. Mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning. Different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates. Interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are reflected in the different rate scenarios. 
    
  The Company uses its simulation model to estimate earnings in rate environments where rates are instantaneously shocked up or down around a  most likely  rate scenario, based on implied forward rates. The analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a 12 month time horizon after an immediate increase or  shock  in rates, of 100 basis points up to 300 basis points. The shock down 200 or 300 basis points analysis is not as meaningful as interest rates across most of the yield curve are at historic lows and cannot decrease another 200 or 300 basis points. The model, under all scenarios, does not drop the index below zero. 
    
  The following table represents the interest rate sensitivity on net interest income for the Company across the rate paths modeled for balances as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands): 

-  68  - 

Asset sensitivity indicates that in a rising interest rate environment the Company s net interest income would increase and in a decreasing interest rate environment the Company s net interest income would decrease. Liability sensitivity indicates that in a rising interest rate environment the Company s net interest income would decrease and in a decreasing interest rate environment the Company s net interest income would increase. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company became more asset sensitive in a rising interest rate environment scenario when compared to September 30, 2015 in part due to the composition of the balance sheet and in part due to the market characteristics of certain deposit products. The Company would expect net interest income to increase with an immediate increase or shock in market rates. In the decreasing interest rate environments, the Company would expect a decline in net interest income as interest-earning assets re-price at lower rates and interest-bearing deposits remain at or near their floors. It should be noted that although net interest income simulation results are presented through the down 300 basis points interest rate environments, the Company does not believe the down 200 and 300 basis point scenarios are plausible given the current level of interest rates. 
    
  ECONOMIC VALUE SIMULATION 
    
  Economic value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. Economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. The change in net economic value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term earnings capability of the balance sheet. The same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation. The economic value simulation uses instantaneous rate shocks to the balance sheet. 
    
  The following chart reflects the estimated change in net economic value over different rate environments using economic value simulation for the balances at the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands): 

The shock down 200 or 300 basis points analysis is not as meaningful since interest rates across most of the yield curve are at historic lows and cannot decrease another 200 or 300 basis points.  While management considers this scenario highly unlikely, the natural floor increases the Company s sensitivity in rates down scenarios.  
    
  Compared to September 30, 2015, the Company s economic value of equity model as of September 30, 2016 projects that an instantaneous change in market interest rates would result in more overall variation in the Company s estimated economic value of equity in the shock up 100, 200 or 300 basis point and shock down 100 basis point interest rate scenarios, while the Company is     less     sensitive to market interest rates in a shock down 200 and 300 basis point scenario. The Company believes the down 200 and 300 basis point scenarios are not plausible given the current low level of interest rates.

ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  The Company maintains  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating its disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
    
  Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. There was no change in the internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting.
