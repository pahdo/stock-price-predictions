Note 1   Basis of Presentation  

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements of EnerJex Resources, Inc. ( we ,  us ,  our ,  EnerJex  and  Company )
have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information
and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair
presentation.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  The results of operations for the interim
period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year.  Certain amounts in the prior year
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentations.  The statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015. 

Our consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, EnerJex Kansas, Inc., Black Sable Energy, LLC, Working Interest, LLC and Black Raven
Energy, Inc. for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015. All intercompany
transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Note 2   Going Concern  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. 

On October 3, 2011, the Company, entered into
an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Texas Capital Bank, and other financial institutions and banks ( TCB 
or  Bank ) that may become a party to the Credit Agreement from time to time. The facilities provided under the Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement was to be used to refinance a prior outstanding revolving loan facility with TCB dated July 3, 2008,
and for working capital and general corporate purposes. On August 15, 2014 the Company entered into an Eighth Amendment to the
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Among other things the Eighth Amendment extended the maturity of the Agreement by three
years to October 3, 2018. On August 12, 2015, the Company entered into a Tenth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
Among other things the Tenth Amendment established the requirement of monthly borrowing base reductions commencing September 1,
2015 and continuing on the first of each month thereafter. On November 13, 2015, the Company entered into a Eleventh Amendment
to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Eleventh Amendment reflects the following changes: (i) waived certain provisions
of the Credit Agreement, (ii) suspend certain hedging requirements, and (iii) to make certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement. 

On April 1, 2016 the Company informed the Bank
that it would cease making the mandatory monthly borrowing base reduction payments and did not make the required April 1, 2016
payment. The Company made its mandatory quarterly interest payment on April 6, 2016 and on April 7, 2016 entered into a Forbearance
Agreement whereby the Bank agreed to not exercise remedies and rights afforded it under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
for thirty days. On May 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank amended to the Forbearance Agreement to extend the forbearance period
to August 31, 2016. On July 29, 2016, the Company and the Bank entered into a Third Forbearance Agreement which extended the forbearance
period to October 1, 2016. Upon the expiration of the Third Forbearance agreement, the Company did not enter into a fourth Forbearance
Agreement. Also, at that time the Company discontinued payment of interest on its outstanding loan obligations with the Bank. 

The Company is evaluating plans to restructure,
amend or refinance existing debt through private options. However, if the Company is
not able to restructure, amend or refinance its existing debt, the debt is due and payable and the Company does not have sufficient
liquidity to repay those amounts. In that event, if the Company is unable to reach an agreement with the Bank, the Company could
be required to immediately file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

As shown in the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred losses in 2015 and 2016, also generating negative cash flows from operating
activities. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $84,371,617 and a working capital deficit (total
current liabilities exceeded total current assets) of $16,550,678.  The Company s cash balance and revenues generated
are not currently sufficient and cannot be projected to cover operating expenses for the next twelve months from the filing date
of this report. 

These factors raises substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Note 3   Stock Options  

A summary of stock options
is as follows:  

Note 4   Fair Value Measurements  

We hold certain financial assets which are required
to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 157,
  Fair Value Measurements   ( ASC Topic 820-10 ). ASC Topic 820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (Level 3 measurements). ASC Topic 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement
assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820-10 are described below: 

Level 1. Valuations based on quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access.  

Level 2. Valuations based on quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs
that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We
consider the derivative liability to be Level 2. We determine the fair value of the derivative liability utilizing
various inputs, including NYMEX price quotations and contract terms. 

Level 3. Valuations based on inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. We consider
our marketable securities to be Level 3 

Our derivative instruments consist of fixed
price commodity swaps and deferred premium puts. 

Note 5   Asset Retirement Obligation  

Our asset retirement obligations relate to the
liabilities associated with the abandonment of oil and natural gas wells. The amounts recognized are based on numerous estimates
and assumptions, including future retirement costs, inflation rates and credit adjusted risk-free interest rates. The following
shows the changes in asset retirement obligations: 

Note 6   Derivative Instruments  

We have entered into certain derivative or physical
arrangements with respect to portions of our crude oil production to reduce our sensitivity to volatile commodity prices and/or
to meet hedging requirements under our Credit Facility. We believe that these derivative arrangements, although not free
of risk, allow us to achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations. However,
derivative arrangements limit the benefit of increases in the prices of crude oil. Moreover, our derivative arrangements apply
only to a portion of our production. 

We have an Inter-creditor Agreement in place
between us, our counterparties, BP Corporation North America, Inc. ( BP ) and our agent Texas Capital Bank, N.A., which
allows Texas Capital Bank to also act as agent for the counterparties for the purpose of holding and enforcing any liens or security
interests resulting from our derivative arrangements. Therefore, we are not required to post additional collateral, including
cash. 

The following derivative contract was in place
at September 30, 2016: 

Monthly volume is the weighted average throughout
the period. 

The total fair value of the derivative contract
is shown as a derivative receivable in both the current and non-current sections of the balance sheet.  

Note 7  
Long-Term Debt  

Senior Secured Credit Facility   

On October 3, 2011, the Company and DD Energy,
Inc., EnerJex Kansas, Inc., Black Sable Energy, LLC and Working Interest, LLC ( Borrowers ) entered into an Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement with Texas Capital Bank, N.A. (the  Bank ) and other financial institutions and banks
that may become a party to the Credit Agreement from time to time. The facilities provided under the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement were used to refinance Borrowers  prior outstanding revolving loan facility with Bank, dated July 3, 2008, and
for working capital and general corporate purposes.  

At our option, loans under the facility will
bear stated interest based on the Base Rate plus Base Rate Margin, or Floating Rate plus Floating Rate Margin (as those terms are
defined in the Credit Agreement). The Base Rate will be, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of (a) the
Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% and (b) the Bank s prime rate. The Floating Rate shall mean, at Borrower s option, a
per annum interest rate equal to (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus Eurodollar Margin, or (ii) the Base Rate plus Base Rate Margin (as
those terms are defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). Eurodollar borrowings may be for one, two, three, or nine
months, as selected by the Borrowers. The margins for all loans are based on a pricing grid ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% for the
Base Rate Margin and 2.25% to 3.00% for the Floating Rate Margin based on the Company s Borrowing Base Utilization Percentage
(as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement).  

On December 15, 2011, we entered into a First
Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Second Amended and Restated Promissory Note in the amount of $50,000,000
with the Bank. The Amendment reflected the addition of Rantoul Partners as an additional Borrower and added as additional security
for the loans the assets held by Rantoul Partners.  

On August 31, 2012, we entered into a Second
Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the Bank. The Second Amendment: (i) increased our borrowing base to $7,000,000,
(ii) reduced the minimum interest rate to 3.75%, and (iii) added additional new leases as collateral for the loan.  

On November 2, 2012, we entered into a Third
Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the Bank. The Third Amendment (i) increased our borrowing base to $12,150,000,
and (ii) clarified certain continuing covenants and provided a limited waiver of compliance with one of the covenants so clarified
for the quarter ended December 31, 2011.  

On January 24, 2013, we entered into a Fourth
Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which was made effective as of December 31, 2012 with the Bank.  The Fourth
Amendment reflects the following changes: (i) the Bank consented to the restructuring transactions related to the dissolution of
Rantoul Partners, and (ii) the Bank terminated a Limited Guaranty, as defined in the Credit Agreement, executed by Rantoul Partners
in favor of the Bank.  

On April 16, 2013, the Bank increased our borrowing
base to $19.5 million.  

On September 30, 2013, we entered into a Fifth
Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  The Fifth Amendment reflects the following changes:  (i) an
expanded principal commitment amount of the Bank to $100,000,000, (ii) an increase in our Borrowing Base to $38,000,000, (iii)
the addition of Black Raven Energy, Inc. to the Credit Agreement as a borrower party, (iv) the addition of certain collateral and
security interests in favor of the Bank, and (v) the reduction of our current interest rate to 3.30%.    

On November 19, 2013, we entered into a Sixth
Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Sixth Amendment reflects the following changes: (i) the addition of
Iberia Bank as a participant in our credit facility, and (ii) a technical correction to our covenant calculations. 

On May 22, 2014, we entered into a Seventh Amendment
to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Seventh Amendment reflects the Bank s consent to our issuance of up to
850,000 shares of our 10% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock. 

On August 15, 2014, we entered into an Eighth
Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Eighth Amendment reflects the following changes: (i) the borrowing
base was increased from $38 million to $40 million, and (ii) the maturity of the facility was extended by three years to October
3, 2018. 

On April 29, 2015, we entered into a Ninth
Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. In the Ninth Amendment, the Banks (i) re-determined the Borrowing Base
based upon the recent Reserve Report dated January 1, 2015, (ii) imposed affirmative obligations on the Company to use a portion
of proceeds received with regard to future sales of securities or certain assets to repay the loan, (iii) consented to non-compliance
by the Company with certain terms of the Credit Agreement, (iv) waived certain provisions of the Credit Agreement, and (v) agreed
to certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement. 

On May 1, 2015, the Borrowers and the Banks
entered into a Letter Agreement to clarify that up to $1,000,000 in proceeds from any potential future securities offering will
be unencumbered by the Banks  Liens as described in the Credit Agreement through November 1, 2015, and that, until November
1, 2015, such proceeds shall not be subject to certain provisions in the Credit Agreement prohibiting the Company from declaring
and paying dividends that may be due and payable to holders of securities issued in such potential offerings or issued prior to
the Letter Agreement. 

On August 12, 2015, we entered into a Tenth
Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Tenth Amendment reflects the following changes: (i) allow the Company
to sell certain oil assets in Kansas, (ii) allow for approximately $1,300,000 of the proceeds from the sale to be reinvested in
Company owned oil and gas projects and (iii) apply not less than $1,500,000 from the proceed of the sale to outstanding loan balances. 

On November 13, 2015, the Company entered into
a Eleventh Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Eleventh Amendment reflects the following changes: (i) waived
certain provisions of the Credit Agreement, (ii) suspend certain hedging requirements, and (iii) to make certain other amendments
to the Credit Agreement. 

Our current borrowing base is $17,925,000 of
which we had borrowed $17,925,000 as of September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016 and at December 31, 2015 the interest rate on
amounts borrowed under our credit facility was approximately 5.5% and 4.3% respectively. This facility expires on October 3, 2018.  

On April 1, 2016 the Company informed the Bank
that it would cease making the mandatory monthly borrowing base reduction payments and did not make the required April 1, 2016
payment. The Company made its mandatory quarterly interest payment on April 6, 2016 and on April 7, 2016 entered into a Forbearance
Agreement whereby the Bank agreed to not exercise remedies and rights afforded it under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
for thirty days. On May 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank amended the Forbearance Agreement to extend the forbearance period to
August 31, 2016. On July 29, 2016, the Company and the Bank entered into a Third Forbearance Agreement which extended the forbearance
period to October 1, 2016. Upon the expiration of the Third Forbearance agreement, the Company did not enter into a fourth Forbearance
Agreement. Also, at that time the Company discontinued payment of interest on its outstanding loan obligations with the Bank. 

The Company is evaluating plans to restructure,
amend or refinance existing debt through private options. However, if the Company is
not able to restructure, amend or refinance its existing debt, the debt is due and payable and the Company does not have sufficient
liquidity to repay those amounts. In that event, if the Company is unable to reach an agreement with the Bank, the Company could
be required to immediately file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Note 8   Commitments   Contingencies  

As of September 30, 2016 the Company had an
outstanding irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $50,000 issued in favor of the Texas Railroad Commission. The letter
of credit is required by the Texas Railroad Commission for all companies operating in the state of Texas with production greater
than limits they prescribe. 

Rent expense for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $104,000 and $112,000 respectively. Future non-cancellable minimum lease payments are approximately
$35,000 for the remainder of 2016, $145,000 for 2017, $90,000 for 2018 and $77,000 for 2019.  

Note 9   Impairment of Oil and Gas
Properties  

Pursuant to full cost accounting rules, the
Company must perform a ceiling test each quarter on its proved oil and natural gas assets within each separate cost center. All
of the Company s costs are included in one cost center as all of the Company s operations are located in the United
States. The Company s ceiling test was calculated using trailing twelve-month, unweighted-average first-day-of-the-month
prices for oil and natural gas as of September 30, 2016, which were based on a West Texas Intermediate oil price of $41.97 per
Bbl and a Henry Hub natural gas price of $2.39 per Mcf (adjusted for basis and quality differentials), respectively. This test
resulted in a pre-tax write-down of $800,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and $7,444,597 for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016. In 2015 the Company recorded pre  tax write-downs of approximately $48.9 million. Additional material
write-downs of the Company s oil and gas properties could occur in subsequent quarters in the event that oil and natural
gas prices remain at current depressed levels, or if the Company experiences significant downward adjustments to its estimated
proved reserves. 

Note 10   Subsequent Events  

On October 1, 2016, the Company and the Bank
could not reach an agreement to extend the Third Amendment to the Forbearance Agreement. Following this outcome, the Company decided
to discontinue payment of interest on its outstanding loan obligations with the Bank. The Company is evaluating plans to restructure,
amend or refinance existing debt through private options and is optimistic of a successful outcome. However, it could seek a protected
reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. federal bankruptcy code. 

We have reviewed
all material events through the date of this report in accordance with ASC 855-10.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

The following discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to our financial
statements included elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected
events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including
those discussed under ITEM 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report.  

Overview   

Our principal strategy is to acquire, develop,
explore and produce domestic onshore oil properties. Our business activities are currently focused in Kansas, Colorado and Texas. 

We continue to investigate multiple opportunities
to both unlock value and accelerate growth in an accretive manner on behalf of shareholders, including but not limited to mergers,
acquisitions, joint ventures, and non-dilutive financings. There can be no assurance of the results or timing associated with this
process. 

We have substantially curtailed capital spending
in the current commodity price environment. Once the commodity market improves, we intend to focus our capital budget on the development
of our Colorado and Kansas properties where we have identified hundreds of drilling locations and reactivation or recompletion
opportunities that we believe will generate high rates of return with low risk profiles. 

Recent Developments   

The following is a brief description of
our most significant corporate developments that have occurred since the end of 2015: 

On April 1, 2016 the Company informed the Bank
that it would cease making the mandatory monthly borrowing base reduction payments and did not make the required April 1, 2016
payment. The Company made its mandatory quarterly interest payments on April 6, 2016, and May 2, 2016. On April 7, 2016 the Company
entered into a Forbearance Agreement whereby the Bank agreed to not exercise remedies and rights afforded it under the Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement for thirty days. The thirty day period was to be used by the Company to pursue strategic alternatives. 

On April 28, 2016 the Bank informed the Company
that it would extend the above Forbearance Agreement period to May 31, 2016 upon effecting a principal reduction of $125,000. In
addition, the Company will receive an automatic extension to September 15, 2016 upon meeting certain terms and conditions specified
by the Bank. On May 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank amended to the Forbearance Agreement to extend the forbearance period to
August 31, 2016. On July 29, 2016, the Company and the Bank amended the Forbearance Agreement to extend the forbearance period
to October 1, 2016. 

On October 1, 2016, the Company and the Bank
could not reach an agreement to extend the Third Amendment to the Forbearance Agreement. Following this outcome, the Company decided
to discontinue payment of interest on its outstanding loan obligations with the Bank. The Company is evaluating plans to restructure,
amend or refinance existing debt through private options and is optimistic of a successful outcome. However, it could seek a protected
reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. federal bankruptcy code. 

Net Production, Average Sales Price and Average Production
and Lifting Costs   

The table below sets forth our net oil production
(net of all royalties, overriding royalties and production due to others), the average sales prices, average production costs and
direct lifting costs per unit of production for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

(1)   
      Production costs include all operating expenses, transportation expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization, lease operating expenses and all associated taxes. Impairment of oil properties is not included in production costs.   

(2)   
      Direct lifting costs do not include impairment expense or depreciation, depletion and amortization.   

Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 compared.  

Income :  

Oil Revenues   

Oil revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 were $454,825 compared to revenues of $943,597 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Of the revenue
decrease of $488,772 approximately $270 thousand was due to lower production volumes. Production decreased in the third quarter
of 2016 from 22,346 barrels produced in 2015 to 14,015 barrels produced in 2016. Production decreases in the quarter are primarily
the result of depletion and the curtailment of both growth and maintenance capital. Additionally, revenues decreased approximately
$218 thousand due to lower crude oil prices. Crude oil prices dropped $9.78 or 23.2% from an average price of $32.45 per barrel
for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $42.23 per barrel for the same period in 2015. 

Oil revenues for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 were $1,581,972 compared to revenues of $3,822,466 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Of the revenue decrease
of $2,240,494 approximately $1.4 million was due to lower production volumes. Production decreased in the first nine months of
2016 from 84,310 barrels produced in 2015 to 44,961 barrels produced in 2016. Production decreases are the result of depletion,
the curtailment of both growth and maintenance capital expenditures, and sale of non-core assets. Additionally, revenues decreased
approximately $.8 million due to lower crude oil prices. Crude oil prices dropped $10.15 or 22.4% from an average price of $45.34
per barrel for the first nine months of 2015 compared to $35.19 per barrel for the same period in 2016. 

Natural Gas Revenues   

Natural gas revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 were $18,929 compared to revenues of $85,793 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Of the revenue decrease
of $66,864 approximately $64,000 was due to lower production volumes. Production decreased in the third quarter 2016 from 50,202
mcf produced in 2015 to 11,493 mcf for the comparable period of 2016. The production decrease was due primarily to depletion of
reserves and the curtailment of both growth and maintenance capital expenditures. Additionally, approximately $3 thousand of the
revenue decrease was due to lower natural gas prices. Natural gas prices dropped $.06 or 3.6% from an average price of $1.71 per
mcf in the third quarter of 2015 to an average price of $1.65 per mcf for the same period of 2016. 

Natural gas revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were $43,461 compared to revenues of $290,246 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Of the revenue decrease
of $246,785 approximately $143 thousand was due to lower production volumes. Production decreased in the first nine months of 2016
from 171,275 mcf in 2015 to 39,692 mcf for the comparable period of 2016. Production decreases are the result of natural depletion
and the curtailment of both growth and maintenance capital expenditures. Additionally, revenues declined $104 thousand due to lower
natural gas prices. Natural gas prices dropped $.60 or 35.4% from an average price of $1.69 per mcf for the first nine months of
2015 to an average price of $1.09 per mcf for the same period of 2016. 

Expenses:   

Direct Operating Costs   

Direct operating costs include direct labor
and equipment costs related to pumping, gauging, pulling, well repairs, compression, transportation costs, and general maintenance
requirements in our oil and gas fields. These costs also include certain contract labor costs, and other non-capitalized expenses. 

Direct operating costs for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 decreased $290,579, or 33.8% to $569,109 from $859,688 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Direct operating costs per boe increased $7.74 or approximately 27.6% in 2016 compared to 2015 at $35.73 per boe and $27.99 per
boe respectively. 

Direct operating costs for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 decreased $1,391,295, or 42.1% to $1,916,774 from $3,308,069 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Direct
operating costs per boe increased $7.85 or approximately 26.8% in 2016 compared to 2015 at $37.16 per boe and $29.31 per boe respectively. 

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization   

Depreciation, depletion and amortization
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $63,644 compared to $112,288 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease in depletion expense of approximately $58,000 is due to a lower per boe depletion rates in 2016 compared to 2015 combined
with lower production in 2016 versus 2015. The lower depletion rate resulted from the write-down of oil and gas properties mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Full Cost Ceiling Test rules (see footnote 9 to the financial statements for
a full explanation of the Ceiling Test). Depletion expense per boe decreased $3.09 or 69.6% in the third quarter of 2016 compared
to the same period of 2015. 

Depletion expense decreased approximately $832,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015. This decrease was due primarily to the
write-down of oil and gas assets referred to above, resulting in a depletion expense per boe decrease of $5.27 or 57.6% for the
first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. 

Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties   

Under the full cost method of accounting, capitalized
oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the sum
of the present value, discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves and the cost of unproved
properties not subject to amortization (without regard to estimates of fair value), or estimated fair value, if lower, of unproved
properties that are not subject to amortization. Should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling, an impairment expense is recognized. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
we recognized an impairment expense on our evaluated oil and gas properties of $800,000 compared to $9,720,983 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the write-down was $7,444,597 versus $37,543,972 for the
comparable period of 2015. 

Professional Fees   

Professional fees for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 were $43,968 compared to $136,464 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in professional
fees of approximately $92,000 was due primarily to reduced spending in 2016 on consultation fees associated with an investor relations
consulting groups and reduced legal expenses. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
professional fees were $181,086 compared to $487,287 for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in professional fee expenses were
due primarily to reduced spending on investor relations, utilization of third party engineering consultants and legal fees.   

Salaries   

Salaries for the third quarter of 2016 decreased
37% from $471,756 in the third quarter of 2015 to $297,244 in the current quarter. Salaries for nine months ended September 30,
2016 decreased $440,876 or 29.7% to $1,044,639 compared to $1,485,515 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  These
decreases in salaries were due to reductions of Company personnel. 

Administrative Expenses   

For the third quarter of 2016 Administrative
expense increased $28,390 or 29.7% to $124,090 from $95,700 in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in costs was due primarily
to lower G A reimbursements from a joint venture partner and slightly increased insurance and IT costs. 

Administrative expenses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were $435,616 compared to $525,733 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Administrative expenses
decreased approximately $90,000 or 17.1% in 2016 due primarily lower SEC related expenditures, lower travel costs, lower rents
and diminished expenditures for employee training. These decreases were partially offset by lower reimbursements from a joint venture
partner. 

Interest Expense   

Interest expense for the third quarter of
2016 was $339,719 compared to $306,933 for the comparable quarter of 2015, an increase of approximately $33,000. Interest expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,001,937 compared to $937,638 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 an
increase of approximately $64,000. Interest expense increased as a result of higher interest rates. This increase was partially
offset by decreased outstanding borrowings in 2016 compared to 2015. 

Gain (Loss) on Derivatives   

We incurred an unrealized losses of $68,459
in the third quarter of 2016 and $2,449,855 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the marking to market of our derivative
contracts for the quarter and nine months of 2016 compared to an unrealized gain of $941,076 in the third quarter of 2015 and an
unrealized loss of $1,234,573 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change in values was due primarily to the completion
of contracts during the quarter and nine month period ending September 30, 2016. 

Other Income   

Other income decreased
$649,451 in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and decreased $686,608 for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. These decreases were due primarily to the realization of gains and the
concomitant expiration of contracts in our portfolio of derivative contracts for the respective accounting periods. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity is a measure of a company's ability
to meet potential cash requirements. We have historically met our capital requirements through debt financing, revenues from operations,
asset sales, and the issuance of equity securities. Due to the decline in oil prices, the resulting decline in our reserves as
reflected in our reserve report which caused a corresponding reduction in our borrowing base, and the recent issuances of equity
securities from our  shelf  registration, it will be more difficult in 2016 to use our historical means of meeting our
capital requirements to provide us with adequate liquidity to fund our operations and capital program. 

The Company s liquidity outlook has
continued to decline due to continued low commodity prices. The significant risks and uncertainties described in the Risk Factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

As of the filing date, November 14, 2016,
the Company is in default under its credit facility with the Bank. If the Company is unable to obtain a waiver or other suitable
relief from the Bank under the credit facility the Bank could accelerate the outstanding indebtedness, which would make it immediately
due and payable. If the Company is unable to obtain a waiver from or otherwise reach an agreement with the Bank, the Company will
not have sufficient liquidity to repay its indebtedness. 

The Company is evaluating plans to restructure,
amend or refinance existing debt through private options. However, if the Company is not able to restructure, amend or refinance its existing
debt, the debt is due and payable and the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to repay those amounts. In that event, if the Company is unable to reach an agreement with the Bank,
the Company could be required to immediately file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

The following table summarizes total current
assets, total current liabilities and working capital. 

Senior Secured Credit Facility   

On October 3, 2011, the Company and DD Energy,
Inc., EnerJex Kansas, Inc., Black Sable Energy, LLC and Working Interest, LLC ( Borrowers ) entered into an Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement with Texas Capital Bank, N.A. (the  Bank ) and other financial institutions and banks
that may become a party to the Credit Agreement from time to time. The facilities provided under the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement were used to refinance Borrowers prior outstanding revolving loan facility with Bank, dated July 3, 2008, and for working
capital and general corporate purposes.  

At our option, loans under the facility will
bear stated interest based on the Base Rate plus Base Rate Margin, or Floating Rate plus Floating Rate Margin (as those terms are
defined in the Credit Agreement). The Base Rate will be, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of (a) the
Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% and (b) the Bank s prime rate. The Floating Rate shall mean, at Borrower s option, a
per annum interest rate equal to (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus Eurodollar Margin, or (ii) the Base Rate plus Base Rate Margin (as
those terms are defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). Eurodollar borrowings may be for one, two, three, or nine
months, as selected by the Borrowers. The margins for all loans are based on a pricing grid ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% for the
Base Rate Margin and 2.25% to 3.00% for the Floating Rate Margin based on the Company s Borrowing Base Utilization Percentage
(as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). 

On December 15, 2011, we entered into a First
Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Second Amended and Restated Promissory Note in the amount of $50,000,000
with the Bank, which closed on December 15, 2011. The Amendment reflected the addition of Rantoul Partners as an additional Borrower

Rantoul Partners, and (ii) the Bank terminated a Limited Guaranty, as defined in the Credit Agreement, executed by Rantoul Partners
in favor of the Bank. 

On April 16, 2013, the Bank increased our borrowing
base to $19.5 million. 

On September 30, 2013, we entered into a Fifth

principal commitment amount of the Bank to $100,000,000, (ii) an increase in our Borrowing Base to $38,000,000, (iii) the addition
of Black Raven Energy, Inc. to the Credit Agreement as a borrower party, (iv) the addition of certain collateral and security interests
in favor of the Bank, and (v) the reduction of our current interest rate to 3.30%.   

On November 19, 2013, we entered into a Sixth
Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Sixth Amendment reflects the following changes: (i) the addition of
Iberia Bank as a participant into our credit facility, and (ii) made a technical correction to our covenant calculations. 

On May 22, 2014, we entered into a Seventh Amendment
to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Seventh Amendment reflects the Bank s consent to our issuance of up to
850,000 shares of our 10% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock. 

On August 15, 2014, we entered into an Eighth
Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Eighth Amendment reflects the following changes: (i) the borrowing
base was increased from $38 million to $40 million, and (ii) the maturity of the facility was extended by three years to October

On April 29, 2015, we entered into a Ninth Amendment
to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. In the Ninth Amendment, the Banks (i) re-determined the Borrowing Base based upon the
recent Reserve Report dated January 1, 2015, (ii) imposed affirmative obligations on the Company to use a portion of proceeds received
with regard to future sales of securities or certain assets to repay the loan, (iii) consented to non-compliance by the Company
with certain terms of the Credit Agreement, (iv) waived certain provisions of the Credit Agreement, and (v) agreed to certain other
amendments to the Credit Agreement. 

On May 1, 2015, the Borrowers and the Banks
entered into a Letter Agreement to clarify that up to $1,000,000 in proceeds from any potential future securities offering will
be unencumbered by the Banks  Liens as described in the Credit Agreement through November 1, 2015, and that, until November
1, 2015, such proceeds shall not be subject to certain provisions in the Credit Agreement prohibiting the Company from declaring
and paying dividends that may be due and payable to holders of securities issued in such potential offerings or issued prior to
the Letter Agreement. 

On August 12, 2015, we entered into a Tenth
Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Tenth Amendment reflects the following changes: (i) allow the Company
to sell certain oil assets in Kansas, (ii) allow for approximately $1,300,000 of the proceeds from the sale to be reinvested in
Company owned oil and gas projects and (iii) apply not less than $1,500,000 from the proceed of the sale to outstanding loan balances. 

On November 13, 2015, the Company entered into
a Eleventh Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Eleventh Amendment reflects the following changes: (i) waived
certain provisions of the Credit Agreement, (ii) suspend certain hedging requirements, and (iii) to make certain other amendments
to the Credit Agreement. 

Our current borrowing base is $17,925,000,
of which we had borrowed $17,925,000 as of September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016 and at December 31, 2015 the interest rate
on amounts borrowed under our credit facility was approximately 5.5% and 4.3% respectively. This facility expires on October 3,
2018.  

On April 1, 2016 the Company informed the
Bank that it would cease making the mandatory monthly borrowing base reduction payments and did not make the required April 1,
2016 payment. The Company made its mandatory quarterly interest payment on April 6, 2016 and on April 7, 2016 entered into a Forbearance
Agreement whereby the Bank agreed to not exercise remedies and rights afforded it under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
for thirty days. On May 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank amended the Forbearance Agreement to extend the forbearance period to
August 31, 2016. On July 29, 2016, the Company and the Bank entered into a Third Forbearance Agreement which extended the forbearance
period to October 1, 2016. Upon the expiration of the Third Forbearance agreement, the Company did not enter into a fourth Forbearance
Agreement. Also, at that time the Company discontinued payment of interest on its outstanding loan obligations with the Bank. 

The Company is evaluating plans to restructure,
amend or refinance existing debt through private options. However, if the Company is
not able to restructure, amend or refinance its existing debt, the debt is due and payable and the Company does not have sufficient
liquidity to repay those amounts. In that event, if the Company is unable to reach an agreement with the Bank, the Company could
be required to immediately file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Satisfaction of our cash obligations
for the next 12 months   

We intend to meet our near term cash obligations
through the monetization of derivative contracts, assets sales and cash flow generated from operations. Due to the declines in
oil prices, the resulting decline in our reserves caused a corresponding reduction to our borrowing base, and recent issuances
of equity securities from our  shelf  registration, it will be more difficult in 2016 to use our historical means to
meet our cash obligations in the next twelve months. 

Summary of product research and development   

We do not anticipate performing any significant
product research and development under our plan of operation. 

Expected purchase or sale of any significant
equipment   

We anticipate that we will purchase the necessary
production and field service equipment required to produce oil during our normal course of operations over the next twelve months. 

Significant changes in the number of employees   

We added two technical employees in October
2014 and by September 1, 2015, we had eliminated 11 full time positions associated with non-core asset sales. We currently have
16 full-time employees, including field personnel. As production and drilling activities increase or decrease, we may have to
continue to adjust our technical, operational and administrative personnel as appropriate. We are using and will continue to use
independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, particularly in the area of land services, reservoir
engineering, geology drilling, water hauling, pipeline construction, well design, well-site monitoring and surveillance, permitting
and environmental assessment. We believe that this use of third-party service providers may enhance our ability to contain operating
and general expenses, and capital costs. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our critical accounting estimates include the
value of our oil and gas properties, asset retirement obligations, and share-based payments. 

Oil and Gas Properties   

We follow the full-cost method of accounting
under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We also capitalize
internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include
costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities.  

Proved properties are amortized using the units
of production (UOP) method. Currently we only have operations in the Unites States of America. The UOP calculation multiplies the
percentage of estimated proved reserves produced each quarter by the cost of these reserves. The amortization base in the UOP calculation
includes the sum of proved property, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A), estimated future development
costs (future costs to access and develop proved reserves) and asset retirement costs, less related salvage value.  

The cost of unproved properties are excluded
from the amortization calculation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to such properties or until
development projects are placed into service. Geological and geophysical costs not associated with specific properties are recorded
as proved property immediately. Unproved properties are reviewed for impairment quarterly.  

Under the full cost method of accounting, the
net book value of oil and gas properties, less deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated  ceiling.  The ceiling
limitation is (a) the present value of future net revenues computed by applying current prices of oil   gas reserves (with
consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved
oil   gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented, less estimated future expenditures (based on current
costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of 10 percent and assuming
continuation of existing economic conditions plus (b) the cost of properties not being amortized plus (c) the lower of cost or
estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized less (d) income tax effects related to differences
between book and tax basis of properties. Future cash outflows associated with settling accrued retirement obligations are excluded
from the calculation. Estimated future cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an unweighted arithmetic average
of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months held flat for the life of the production, except
where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. 

Any excess of the net book value of proved
oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, over the ceiling is charged to expense and reflected as additional
DD A in the statement of operations. The ceiling calculation is performed quarterly. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we incurred a $7,444,597 impairment charge and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 our impairment charge was $37,543,972.
For the year ended December 31, 2014, there were no impairments resulting from the quarterly ceiling tests.  

Proceeds from the sale or disposition of oil
and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction to capitalized costs unless a significant portion (greater than 25%) of our
reserve quantities are sold, in which case a gain or loss is recognized in income. 

Asset Retirement Obligations   

The asset retirement obligation relates to the
plugging and abandonment costs when our wells are no longer useful. We determine the value of the liability by obtaining quotes
for this service and estimate the increase we will face in the future. We then discount the future value based on an intrinsic
interest rate that is appropriate for us. If costs rise more than what we have expected there could be additional charges in the
future however we monitor the costs of the abandoned wells and we will adjust this liability if necessary. 

Share-Based Payments   

The value we assign to the options and warrants
that we issue is based on the fair market value as calculated by the Black-Scholes pricing model. To perform a calculation of the
value of our options and warrants, we determine an estimate of the volatility of our stock. We need to estimate volatility
because there has not been enough trading of our stock to determine an appropriate measure of volatility. We believe our estimate
of volatility is reasonable, and we review the assumptions used to determine this whenever we issue new equity instruments. If
we have a material error in our estimate of the volatility of our stock, our expenses could be understated or overstated. 

Effects of Inflation and Pricing   

The oil industry is very cyclical and the demand
for goods and services of oil field companies, suppliers and others associated with the industry puts extreme pressure on the economic
stability and pricing structure within the industry. Material changes in prices impact revenue stream, estimates of future reserves,
borrowing base calculations of bank loans and value of properties in purchase and sale transactions. Material changes in prices
can impact the value of oil companies and their ability to raise capital, borrow money and retain personnel. We anticipate business
costs and the demand for services related to production and exploration will fluctuate while the commodity prices for oil remains
volatile. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK.  

We are a smaller reporting Company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES . 

Our chief executive officer, Robert G. Watson,
Jr., and our chief financial officer, Douglas M. Wright, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this
Report pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13-a-15(b). Based on the evaluation, Mr. Watson and Mr. Wright concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  

We may become involved in various routine legal
proceedings incidental to our business. However, to our knowledge as of the date of this transition report, there are no material
pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our property is subject, except the legal proceedings discussed
below. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

In addition to the other information set
forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our
2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on April 11, 2016, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future
results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially
affect our business, financial condition or future results 

The Company is in default of its obligations under its
Senior Secured Credit Facility   

On April 1, 2016 the Company informed the
Bank that it would cease making the mandatory monthly borrowing base reduction payments and did not make the required April 1,
2016 payment. The Company made its mandatory quarterly interest payment on April 6, 2016 and on April 7, 2016 entered into a Forbearance
Agreement whereby the Bank agreed to not exercise remedies and rights afforded it under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
for thirty days. On May 31, 2016, the Company and the Bank amended the Forbearance Agreement to extend the forbearance period to
August 31, 2016. On July 29, 2016, the Company and the Bank entered into a Third Forbearance Agreement which extended the forbearance
period to October 1, 2016. Upon the expiration of the Third Forbearance agreement, the Company did not enter into a fourth Forbearance
Agreement. Also, at that time the Company discontinued payment of interest on its outstanding loan obligations with the Bank. 

The Company is evaluating plans to restructure,
amend or refinance existing debt through private options. However, if the Company is
not able to restructure, amend or refinance its existing debt, the debt is due and payable and the Company does not have sufficient
liquidity to repay those amounts. In that event, if the Company is unable to reach an agreement with the Bank, the Company could
be required to immediately file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

We may seek the protection of the United States Bankruptcy
Court ( Bankruptcy Court ) which may harm our business.   

The Company is analyzing various strategic alternatives to address its and our liquidity and capital structure,
including strategic and refinancing alternatives through a private restructuring. However, a filing under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code ( Chapter 11 ) may be unavoidable. Seeking Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. As long as a Chapter 11 proceeding
continues, our senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization
instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. Bankruptcy Court protection also might make it more difficult to retain
management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. Also during the Chapter 11 proceedings,
our ability to enter into new commodity derivatives covering additional estimated future production would be dependent upon either
entering into unsecured hedges or obtaining Bankruptcy Court approval to enter into secured hedges.
