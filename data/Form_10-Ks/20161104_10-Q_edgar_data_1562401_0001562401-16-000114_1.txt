CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  Various statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of American Homes 4 Rent (the  Company,   we,   our  and  us ), including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future revenues, income and capital spending. Our forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as  estimate,   project,   predict,   believe,   expect,   intend,   anticipate,   potential,   plan,   goal  or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These and other important factors, including those discussed or incorporated by reference under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors , Part I, Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 
    
  While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, assumptions and expectations, they are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not unduly rely on them. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date of this report. We are not obligated to update or revise these statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by applicable law.

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note   1  .   Organization and Operations 
    
  American Homes 4 Rent (the  Company,   we,   our  and  us ) is a Maryland real estate investment trust ( REIT ) formed on October 19, 2012. We are focused on acquiring, renovating, leasing and operating single-family homes as rental properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   48,153   single-family properties in   22   states, including   1,238   properties held for sale. 
    
  From our formation through June 10, 2013, we were externally managed and advised by American Homes 4 Rent Advisor, LLC (the  Advisor ) and the leasing, managing and advertising of our properties was overseen and directed by American Homes 4 Rent Management Holdings, LLC (the  Property Manager ), both of which were subsidiaries of American Homes 4 Rent, LLC ( AH LLC ). On June 10, 2013, we acquired the Advisor and the Property Manager from AH LLC in exchange for   4,375,000   Series D units and   4,375,000   Series E units in American Homes 4 Rent, L.P. (the  operating partnership ), therefore internalizing our management including all administrative, financial, property management, marketing and leasing personnel, including executive management. The Company consolidates the Advisor and the Property Manager and the results of these operations are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Previously, AH LLC exercised control over the Company through the contractual rights provided to the Advisor through an advisory management agreement. Accordingly, the contribution of certain properties by AH LLC to the Company have been deemed to be transactions between entities under common control, and as such, the accounts relating to the properties contributed have been recorded by us as if they had been acquired by us on the dates such properties were acquired by AH LLC. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements include AH LLC s historical carrying values of the properties that had been acquired by AH LLC. Effective August 31, 2016, AH LLC was liquidated and its ownership interests in the operating partnership were distributed to its members. 

Note   2  .   Significant Accounting Policies    
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and include the accounts of the Company, the operating partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company consolidates real estate partnerships and other entities that are not variable interest entities ( VIEs ) when it owns, directly or indirectly, a majority interest in the entity or is otherwise able to control the entity. The Company consolidates VIEs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 810,   Consolidation,   if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE as determined by its power to direct the VIE s activities and the obligation to absorb its losses or the right to receive its benefits, which are potentially significant to the VIE. Entities for which the Company owns an interest, but does not consolidate, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as an investment in unconsolidated subsidiary and are included in escrow deposits, prepaid expenses and other assets within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Ownership interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of the Company held by outside parties are included in noncontrolling interest within the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Any references in this report to the number of properties is outside the scope of our independent registered public accounting firm s review of our financial statements, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods have been made. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest     (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   deferred financing costs, net of amortization, related to our asset-backed securitizations have been classified in asset-backed securitizations, net within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Prior to January 1, 2016, these costs were included in deferred costs and other intangibles, net within the condensed  
  
   7 

consolidated balance sheets. All prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. This resulted in the reclassification of   $56.6 million   of deferred financing costs, net of amortization, from deferred costs and other intangibles, net to asset-backed securitizations, net as of December 31, 2015, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, due to the stabilization of our portfolio and the majority of our properties having been initially leased, vacant single-family properties and other expenses have been reclassified in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, with vacant single-family property operating expenses combined with leased single-family property operating expenses, which are both included in property operating expenses within the condensed consolidated statements of operations, and other expenses reclassified to other expenses within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. This resulted in the reclassification of the   $2.5 million   and   $13.0 million  , respectively, of vacant single-family properties and other expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , with   $1.4 million   and   $10.3 million  , respectively, of vacant single-family property operating expenses reclassified to property operating expenses and   $1.1 million   and   $2.7 million  , respectively, of other expenses reclassified to other expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Effective July 1, 2016, due to recently increased volume in the Company's sales of single-family properties, gains and losses from the sales of single-family properties have been included in gain on sale of single-family properties, net within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Prior period gains and losses from the sales of single-family properties, which were previously included in other revenues have been reclassified to gain on sale of single-family properties, net to conform to the current presentation.  
    
  There have been no other changes to our significant accounting policies that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, compared to those policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . Therefore, notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in our most recent audited consolidated financial statements have been omitted. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326)  , to amend the accounting for credit losses for certain financial instruments by requiring companies to recognize an estimate of expected credit losses as an allowance in order to recognize such losses more timely than under previous guidance that had allowed companies to wait until it was probable such losses had been incurred. The guidance will be effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718),   which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than one year. Lessor accounting will remain similar to lessor accounting under previous GAAP, while aligning with the FASB's new revenue recognition guidance. The guidance will be effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The guidance will be effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which provides guidance on revenue recognition and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , most industry-specific guidance and some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35,    Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts  .  The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance.  
  
   8 

These judgments may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The guidance will be effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those annual periods. At that time, the Company may adopt the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption of this guidance and does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements. 

Note   3  .   Single-Family Properties    
    
  Single-family properties, net, consisted of the following as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Single-family properties, net increased   $1.2 billion   to   $7.5 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6.3 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  , primarily related to the acquisition of   8,936   properties in connection with the Merger with American Residential Properties, Inc. ("ARPI") (see Note 10). Single-family properties, net at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , included   $15.4 million   and   $8.5 million  , respectively, related to properties for which the recorded grant deed had not been received. For these properties, the trustee or seller has warranted that all legal rights of ownership have been transferred to us on the date of the sale, but there was a delay for the deeds to be recorded. 
    
  Depreciation expense related to single-family properties was   $67.2 million   and   $63.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $194.2 million   and   $165.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold   453   and   587   homes, respectively, which     generated total net proceeds of   $56.2 million   and   $71.9 million  , respectively, and resulted in a net gain on sale of   $11.7 million   and   $12.6 million  , respectively. In accordance with ASC 350,   Intangibles Goodwill and Other  , the Company allocates a portion of goodwill to the carrying values of its leased properties sold, which results in a reduction to the gain on sale. The amount of goodwill allocated to leased properties sold during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   $0.4 million  , which reduced goodwill to   $120.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $120.7 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . 

Note   4  .   Rent and Other Receivables, Net    
    
  Included in rent and other receivables, net is an allowance for doubtful accounts of   $4.5 million   and   $3.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Also included in rent and other receivables, net, are non-tenant receivables, which totaled   $0.7 million   and   $1.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Note   5  .   Deferred Costs and Other Intangibles, Net    
    
  Deferred costs and other intangibles, net, consisted of the following as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

Amortization expense related to deferred leasing costs, the value of in-place leases, trademark and database was   $6.9 million   and   $2.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $26.7 million   and   $10.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which has been included in depreciation and amortization within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Deferred financing costs relate to our revolving credit facilities. Amortization of deferred financing costs was   $0.5 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1.9 million   and   $1.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which has been included in gross interest, prior to interest capitalization (see Note   6  ). 
    
  The following table sets forth the estimated annual amortization expense related to deferred costs and other intangibles, net as of   September 30, 2016  , for future periods (in thousands):

              (8) 
    Deferred financing costs relate to our asset-backed securitizations and our term loan facility. Amortization of deferred financing costs was   $2.2 million   and   $1.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $6.3 million   and   $5.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which has been included in gross interest, prior to interest capitalization. 
       
  Asset-Backed Securitization 
    
  In connection with the Merger with ARPI on February 29, 2016 (see Note 10), the Company assumed a securitization loan (the "ARP 2014-SFR1 securitization ), which involved the issuance and sale of single-family rental pass-through certificates that represent beneficial ownership interests in a loan secured by   2,875   homes held by a special purpose entity, ARP 2014-1 Borrower, LLC (the  Borrower ). The Borrower under the loan was wholly owned by another special purpose entity (the  Equity Owner ) and the Equity Owner was wholly owned by the operating partnership. The loan, at the time of its origination by ARPI in August 2014, had an original principal amount of   $342.2 million   and an initial term of   two   years, with   three  ,   12  -month extension options, resulting in a fully extended maturity date of September 9, 2019. It was comprised of   six   floating rate components computed monthly based on 1-month LIBOR for each interest period plus a fixed component spread for each of the   six   components resulting in an effective weighted-average interest rate of 1-month LIBOR plus   2.11%  . Interest on the loan was paid monthly. 
    
  The   2,875   homes securing the loan were substantially similar to the other properties owned by the Company and were leased  
  
   11 

to tenants underwritten on substantially the same basis as the tenants in the Company s other properties. During the duration of the loan, the Borrower s properties were not generally able to be transferred, sold or otherwise securitized, the Company could have substituted properties only if a property owned by the Borrower became a disqualified property under the terms of the loan, and the Borrower was limited in its ability to incur any additional indebtedness.  
    
  The loan was also secured by a security interest in all of the Borrower s personal property and a pledge of all of the assets of the Equity Owner, including a security interest in its membership interest in the Borrower. The Company provided a limited guaranty (i) for certain losses arising out of designated acts of intentional misconduct and (ii) for the principal amount of the loan and all other obligations under the loan agreement in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. The loan required that we maintained certain covenants, including but not limited to, a minimum debt yield on the collateral pool of properties. In September 2016, the Company paid off the ARP 2014-SFR1 asset-backed securitization using available cash and borrowings from our credit facilities, which resulted in a   $10.7 million   loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of the discount on the securitization. The payoff of the ARP 2014-SFR1 asset-backed securitization resulted in the release of the   2,875   collateralized homes and   $10.1 million   of restricted cash for lender requirements. 
    
  Exchangeable Senior Notes, Net 
    
  In connection with the Merger with ARPI on February 29, 2016 (see Note 10), the Company assumed   3.25%   exchangeable senior notes due 2018 that have a   $115.0 million   aggregate principal amount and a fair value at assumption of   $112.3 million  . The exchangeable senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the operating partnership and rank equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the operating partnership. Interest is payable in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning May 15, 2016, until the maturity date of November 15, 2018. The operating partnership s obligations under the exchangeable senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. The exchangeable senior notes bear interest at a rate of   3.25%   per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature, which provides that the exchangeable senior notes may, under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at the option of the operating partnership, based on an initial exchange rate of   46.9423   shares of ARPI's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. The adjusted initial exchange rate would be   53.2795   shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, based on the   1.135   exchange ratio of ARPI shares to our shares resulting from our merger with ARPI. The current exchange rate as of   September 30, 2016  , was   54.6381   shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. The exchange rate changes over time based on our common share price and distributions to common shareholders. 
    
  Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 15, 2018, the notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holders only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter beginning after December 31, 2013 (and only during such quarter) if the closing sale price per share of our common stock is more than   130%   of the then-current exchange price for at least   20   trading days (whether or not consecutive) in the period of   30   consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the   five   consecutive business-day period following any   five   consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes was less than   98%   of the product of the closing sale price per share of our common stock multiplied by the then-current exchange rate; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described in the indenture. On or after August 15, 2018, the notes will be exchangeable at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding the maturity date. Subject to its election to satisfy its exchange obligations entirely in shares of our common stock, upon exchange, the operating partnership will pay or deliver, as the case may be, to exchanging holders in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of notes being exchanged a settlement amount either solely in cash, solely in common shares or in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. 
    
  The fair value of the exchangeable senior notes, which was calculated using a binomial lattice model at the time of assumption, was   $112.3 million  , which represents the   $115.0 million   face value less a discount of   $2.7 million  , which will be amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The amount recorded to exchangeable senior notes, net at the time of assumption was   $105.3 million  , which represents the fair value of   $112.3 million  , less the fair value of the exchange settlement feature of the notes of   $7.0 million  , which was calculated using a straight-debt rate of   6.7%   at the time of assumption. The fair value of the exchange settlement feature was recorded in additional paid-in capital and will be amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the notes.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the exchangeable senior notes, net had a balance of   $107.3 million   in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, which was net of an unamortized discount of   $2.1 million   and   $5.6 million   of unamortized fair value of the exchange settlement feature, which was included in additional paid-in capital within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Credit Facilities 
    
  In March 2013, the Company entered into a   $500.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility with a financial institution,  
  
   12 

which was subsequently amended in September 2013 to, among other things, expand our borrowing capacity to   $800.0 million   and extend the repayment period to September 30, 2018. All borrowings under the credit facility accrued interest at   1-month LIBOR   plus   2.75%   until March 2017, and thereafter at   1-month LIBOR   plus   3.125%  . The credit facility was secured by our operating partnership s membership interests in entities that own certain of our single-family properties and required that we maintain certain financial covenants. In July 2016, the Company paid off the   $142.0 million   of borrowings that had been outstanding on the credit facility as of June 30, 2016, using proceeds from our   6.35%   Series E perpetual preferred share offering, and terminated the credit facility in August 2016. The termination of the credit facility resulted in   $2.7 million   of charges during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , related to deferred financing cost write-offs, that were included in loss on early extinguishment of debt within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  In August 2016, the Company entered into a   $1.0 billion   credit agreement providing for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of   $650.0 million   and a delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of   $350.0 million  . The interest rate on the revolving credit facility is, at the Company s election, a LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from   1.75%   to   2.30%   or a base rate (generally determined according to a prime rate or federal funds rate) plus a margin ranging from   0.75%   to   1.30%  . Loans under the term loan facility accrue interest, at the Company s election, at either a LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from   1.70%   to   2.30%   or a base rate plus a margin ranging from   0.70%   to   1.30%  . In each case, the actual margin is determined according to a ratio of the Company s total indebtedness to total asset value in effect from time to time. Based on current credit metrics for LIBOR based borrowings as of   September 30, 2016  , the revolving credit facility bears interest at 1-month LIBOR plus   1.85%  , and the term loan facility bears interest at 1-LIBOR plus   1.80%  . The credit agreement includes an accordion feature allowing the revolving credit facility or the term loan facility to be increased to an aggregate amount not to exceed   $1.75 billion  , subject to certain conditions. The facilities mature on August 16, 2019. No amortization payments are required on the term loan facility prior to the maturity date. The Company has the option to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility for up to   one   year, and has   two   options to extend the maturity date of the term loan facility for up to   one   year each, in both cases upon payment of an extension fee. The credit agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $75.0 million   of outstanding borrowings against the revolving credit facility,   $250.0 million   of outstanding borrowings against the term loan facility, net and was in compliance with all loan covenants.

Issuance of Class A Common Shares and Class A Units 
    
  In February 2016, the Company issued   36,546,170   Class A common shares,   $0.01   par value per share, and   1,343,843   Class A units in connection with the Merger with ARPI (see Note 10). Class A units represent voting equity interests in our operating partnership. Holders of Class A units in our operating partnership have the right to redeem the units for cash or, at the election of the Company, exchange the units for the Company's Class A common shares on a   one  -for-one basis.  
    
  Perpetual Preferred Shares 
    
  Perpetual preferred shares represent non-voting preferred equity interests in the Company and entitle holders to a cumulative annual cash dividend equal to   6.5%   for Series D cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares ("Series D perpetual preferred shares") and   6.35%   for Series E cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares ("Series E perpetual preferred shares"), which is applied to the liquidation preference at issuance of   $25   per share. The Company may, at its option, redeem the perpetual preferred shares for cash, in whole or in part, from time to time, at any time on or after May 24, 2021, for the Series D perpetual preferred shares and June 29, 2021, for the Series E perpetual preferred shares or within   120   days after the occurrence of a change in control at a redemption price equal to the   $25   per share liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends.  
    
    During May 2016, the Company issued   10,750,000     6.5%   Series D perpetual preferred shares in an underwritten public offering and concurrent private placement, raising gross proceeds of   $268.8 million   before offering costs of   $8.5 million  .  
    
    During June 2016, the Company issued   9,200,000     6.35%   Series E perpetual preferred shares in an underwritten public offering, raising gross proceeds of   $230.0 million   before offering costs of   $7.5 million  .  
    
  Participating Preferred Shares 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the initial liquidation preference on the Company s participating preferred shares, as adjusted by an amount equal to   50%   of the cumulative change in value of an index based on the purchase prices of single-family properties located in our top   20   markets, for all of the Company s outstanding   5.0%   Series A participating preferred shares,   5.0%   Series B participating preferred shares and     5.5%     Series C participating preferred shares was   $470.9 million  . 
    
  Conversion of Series C Convertible Units into Class A Units 
    
  The Series C convertible units represented voting equity interests in our operating partnership owned by former AH LLC members. On February 28, 2016, the third anniversary of their original issue date, the   31,085,974   Series C convertible units converted into Class A units on a   one  -for-one basis in accordance with their terms. 
    
  Conversion of Series E Convertible Units into Series D Convertible Units 
    
  The Series E convertible units represented non-voting equity interests in our operating partnership. Series E convertible units did not participate in any distributions and were convertible into Series D convertible units on February 29, 2016, subject to an earn-out provision based on the level of pro forma annualized EBITDA contribution, as defined, of the Advisor and the Property Manager. The terms of the earn-out provision were met in full and, therefore, the   4,375,000   Series E convertible units were converted into Series D convertible units on a   one  -for-one basis on February 29, 2016. The fair value of the Series D convertible units was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which was primarily driven by the most recent trading price of the Company s Class A common shares into which the Series D convertible units are ultimately convertible. Based on this valuation, the conversion of Series E convertible units into Series D convertible units resulted in a gain of   $11.5 million   which was recorded in gain on conversion of Series E units within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, the Series E convertible units had a   $2.8 million   contingent beneficial conversion feature that represents a return to the Series E convertible unit holders in the form of additional noncontrolling interest, calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value of the Series D units and the Class A units at the time of the conversion of the Series E units into Series D units in February 2016. The contingent beneficial conversion feature was recognized when the contingency was met, which occurred when the Series D units converted into Class A units on September 30, 2016.  
    
  Conversion of Series D Convertible Units into Class A Units 
    
  The Series D convertible units represented non-voting equity interests in our operating partnership owned by former AH LLC members and began participating in distributions, representing   70%   of distributions declared on Class A units,   30   months after their issuance. The Series D convertible units were automatically convertible into Class A units on a   one  -for-one basis only after the later of (1)   30   months after the date of issuance and (2) the earlier of (i) the date on which adjusted funds from operations per Class A  
  
   14 

common share aggregated to   $0.80   or more over four consecutive quarters following the original issuance date of the units and (ii) the date on which the daily closing price of our Class A common shares on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") averaged   $18.00   or more for two consecutive quarters following the original issuance date of the units. On September 30, 2016, the above-referenced conversion contingency was met and the   8,750,000   Series D convertible units were converted into Class A units on a   one  -for-one basis, which resulted in a   $4.8 million   noncash charge that was included in noncontrolling interest within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The noncash charge relates to a contingent beneficial conversion feature that represents a return to the Series D convertible unit holders in the form of additional noncontrolling interest, calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value of the Series D units and the Class A units at the time of their respective issuances, which was recognized when the contingency was met.  
    
  Distributions 
    
  Our board of trustees declared distributions that totaled   $0.05   per share on our Class A and Class B common shares during the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Distributions declared on our   5.0%   Series A participating preferred shares,   5.0%   Series B participating preferred shares and   5.5%   Series C participating preferred shares during the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , totaled   $0.3125   per share,   $0.3125   per share and   $0.34375   per share, respectively.  Distributions declared on our   6.5%   Series D perpetual preferred shares and   6.35%   Series E perpetual preferred shares totaled   $0.40625   per share and   $0.40569   per share, respectively, during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . Distributions declared on our Series C convertible units totaled   zero   and   $0.15113   per unit during the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Distributions declared on our Series D convertible units totaled   $0.035   per unit for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , which represents   70%   of distributions declared on Class A units. 
    
  Noncontrolling Interest 
    
  Noncontrolling interest as reflected in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets primarily consists of the interest held by former AH LLC members in units in the Company s operating partnership. Former AH LLC members owned   54,276,644   and   14,440,670  , or approximately   18.5%   and   6.5%  , of the total   293,987,819   and   222,311,255   Class A units in the operating partnership as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Additionally, former AH LLC members owned   zero   and all   31,085,974   of the Series C convertible units and owned   zero   and all   4,375,000   of the Series D convertible units in the operating partnership as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Noncontrolling interest also includes interests held by former ARPI employees in Class A units of the Company's operating partnership, which were issued in connection with the Merger with ARPI in February 2016. Former ARPI Class A unit holders owned   1,279,316  , or approximately   0.4%   of the total   293,987,819   Class A units in the operating partnership as of   September 30, 2016  . Also included in noncontrolling interest is the outside ownership interest in a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.

  Share Repurchase Program 
    
  On   September 21, 2015  , the Company announced that our Board of Trustees approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to   $300.0 million   of our outstanding Class A common shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The program does not have an expiration date, but may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. All repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an authorized and unissued status. In addition, the excess of the purchase price over the par value of shares repurchased is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased and retired approximately   6.2 million   of our Class A common shares, on a settlement basis, in accordance with the program at a weighted-average price of   $15.44   per share and a total price of   $96.0 million  .  
  
   16 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we repurchased and retired approximately   3.4 million   of our Class A common shares, in accordance with the program at a weighted-average price of   $15.76   per share and a total price of   $53.7 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a remaining repurchase authorization of   $146.7 million   under the program.  
    
  Secondary Offering 
    
  In September 2016, the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (the "Selling Shareholder") sold   43.5 million   of the Company's Class A common shares at an offering price of   $21.75   per share, in a registered offering (the "Secondary Offering"). The Company did not sell any shares in, or receive any proceeds from, the Secondary Offering. The Company incurred approximately   $0.2 million   of expenses in the third quarter of 2016 related to the Secondary Offering, which were included in acquisition fees and costs expensed within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Note   9  .   Related Party Transactions    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , former AH LLC members owned approximately   2.8%   and   3.3%  , respectively, of our outstanding Class A common shares. On a fully-diluted basis, former AH LLC members held (including consideration of   635,075   Class B common shares as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  ,   54,276,644   and   14,440,670   Class A units as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively,   zero   and all   31,085,974   Series C convertible units as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively,   zero   and all   4,375,000   Series D convertible units as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and   zero   and all   4,375,000   Series E convertible units as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively) an approximate   18.6%   and   22.1%   interest at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a net receivable of   $1.3 million   due from affiliates primarily related to expense reimbursements due from a joint venture, which was included in escrow deposits, prepaid expenses and other assets within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a net payable of   $4.1 million   payable to affiliates related to declared and unpaid distributions on the Series C units, partially offset by expense reimbursements from affiliates, which was included in amounts payable to affiliates within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  In June 2014, the Company and the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation ("APFC") formed a joint venture (the "Alaska Joint Venture II"). As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we had contributed   $40.0 million   to the Alaska Joint Venture II and APFC had contributed   $160.0 million  . During the third quarter of 2016, the Alaska Joint Venture II paid distributions totaling   $0.4 million   and   $1.6 million   to us and APFC, respectively. In evaluating the Company's interest in the Alaska Joint Venture II, we concluded that the entity is not a variable interest entity after applying the variable interest model and, therefore, we account for our interest in the Alaska Joint Venture II as an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary using the equity method of accounting after applying the voting interest model. As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance of the Company's investment in the Alaska Joint Venture II was   $33.3 million  , which is included in escrow deposits, prepaid expenses and other assets within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company has a promoted interest in the Alaska Joint Venture II in addition to owning   20%   of its equity.

  On February 29, 2016, the Company completed a merger with ARPI, in which ARPI merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of us in a stock-for-stock transaction, with our subsidiary continuing as the surviving entity (the "Merger"). The purpose of this acquisition was to solidify our position as the largest public owner and operator of single-family rental properties, increase scale and achieve operating synergies. ARPI s portfolio is substantially similar to our own, meets our high quality portfolio standards and the acquisition of their portfolio has allowed us to add density in key markets. As a result of the Merger, each holder of ARPI common stock received   1.135   of our Class A common shares for each share of ARPI common stock and each holder of limited partnership interests in ARPI s operating partnership received   1.135   Class A units of our operating partnership. We issued   36,546,170   Class A common shares and   1,343,843   Class A units in connection with the Merger, representing   12.7%   of the total Class A common shares, Class B common shares and units of our operating partnership, collectively, as of the acquisition date. The equity transaction consideration of   $530.5 million   was calculated based on the   36,546,170   Class A common shares and   1,343,843   Class A units issued in connection with the Merger valued at the Company s closing share price on the acquisition date of   $14.00   per share. Transaction costs incurred by the Company related to the Merger totaled   $7.7 million  , of which   $0.5 million   was incurred during the   third   quarter of   2016  .

Note   11  .   Earnings per Share    
    
  The following table reflects the computation of net income (loss) per share on a basic and diluted basis for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands, except share data):  

Total weighted-average shares for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , excludes an aggregate of   81,898,292   shares or units in our operating partnership, participating preferred shares, common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, restricted stock units and common shares issuable upon the conversion of our exchangeable senior notes from dilutive securities because they were antidilutive due to the net loss attributable to common shareholders in those periods. Total weighted-average shares for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , excludes an aggregate of   73,993,944   shares or units in our operating partnership, participating preferred shares, common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, and restricted stock units from dilutive securities because they were antidilutive due to the net loss attributable to common shareholders in those periods. 

Note   12  .   Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we had commitments to acquire   103   and   12   single-family properties, respectively, with an aggregate purchase price of   $22.4 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had sales in escrow for approximately   445   of our single-family properties for an aggregate selling price of   $26.7 million  . 
    
  We are involved in various legal and administrative proceedings that are incidental to our business. We believe these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations upon resolution. 

Note   13  .   Noncash Transactions    
    
  On February 29, 2016 we completed our Merger with ARPI in a stock-for-stock transaction.  Each holder of ARPI common stock received   1.135   of our Class A common shares for each share of ARPI common stock and each holder of limited partnership interests in ARPI's operating partnership received   1.135   Class A units of our operating partnership. We issued   36,546,170   Class A common shares and   1,343,843   Class A units in connection with the Merger, representing   12.7%   of the total Class A common shares, Class B common shares and units of our operating partnership, collectively, as of the acquisition date (see Note 10). 

Note   14  .   Fair Value    
    
  The carrying amount of rents and other receivables, restricted cash, escrow deposits, prepaid expenses and other assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these amounts. The Company s interest rate cap agreement and preferred shares derivative liability are the only financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

19 

Our credit facilities, term loan facility, asset-backed securitizations, exchangeable senior notes and secured note payable are also financial instruments, which are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as they were estimated by using unobservable inputs. We estimated their fair values by modeling the contractual cash flows required under the instruments and discounting them back to their present values using estimates of current market rates. The following table displays the carrying values and fair values of our debt instruments as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

(2) 
    The exchangeable senior notes, net are presented net of unamortized discounts. As they were recently acquired in connection with the Merger with ARPI in February 2016, we believe the fair value approximates the carrying value. 
              (3) 
    As our revolving credit facility bears interest at a floating rate based on an index plus a spread, which is a LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from   1.75%   to   2.30%   or a base rate (generally determined according to a prime rate or federal funds rate) plus a margin ranging from   0.75%   to   1.30%  , and since this facility was recently entered into in August 2016, management believes that the carrying value of the revolving credit facility as of   September 30, 2016  , reasonably approximates fair value. 
              (4) 
    The carrying value of the term loan facility excludes   $3.4 million   of deferred financing costs as of   September 30, 2016  . As our term loan facility bears interest at a floating rate based on an index plus a spread, which is a LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from   1.70%   to   2.30%   or a base rate (generally determined according to a prime rate or federal funds rate) plus a margin ranging from   0.70%   to   1.30%  , and since this facility was recently entered into in August 2016, management believes that the carrying value of the term loan facility as of   September 30, 2016  , reasonably approximates fair value. 
       
  Valuation of the preferred shares derivative liability considers scenarios in which the preferred shares would be redeemed or converted into Class A common shares by the Company and the subsequent payoffs under those scenarios. The valuation also considers certain variables such as the risk-free rate matching the assumed timing of either redemption or conversion, volatility of the underlying home price appreciation index, dividend payments, conversion rates, the assumed timing of either redemption or conversion and an assumed drift factor in home price appreciation across certain metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, as outlined in the agreement. 
     
  The following table sets forth the fair value of our contingently convertible Series E units liability and preferred shares derivative liability as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):

Item 2.      Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Overview 
    
  We are a Maryland REIT focused on acquiring, renovating, leasing and operating single-family homes as rental properties. We commenced operations in November 2012 to continue the investment activities of AH LLC, which was founded by our chairman, B. Wayne Hughes, in 2011 to take advantage of the dislocation in the single-family home market. Effective August 31, 2016, AH LLC was liquidated and its ownership interests in the operating partnership were distributed to its members. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   48,153   single-family properties, in selected sub-markets of MSAs in   22   states, including   1,238   properties held for sale, of which   1,060   properties were former ARPI properties, compared to   38,780   single-family properties in   22   states, including   45   properties held for sale, as of   December 31, 2015  , and   38,377   single-family properties in   22   states, including   46   properties held for sale, as of   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an additional   103   properties in escrow that we expected to acquire, subject to customary closing conditions, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $22.4 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   44,746  , or   95.4%  , of our total properties (excluding held for sale properties) were leased, compared to   36,403  , or   94.0%  , of our total properties (excluding held for sale properties) as of   December 31, 2015  , and   35,617  , or   92.9%  , of our total properties (excluding held for sale properties) as of   September 30, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio of single-family properties was internally managed through our proprietary property management platform.

  Merger with American Residential Properties, Inc. 
    
  On February 29, 2016, the Company completed its Merger with ARPI, in which ARPI merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of us in a stock-for-stock transaction, with our subsidiary continuing as the surviving entity. As a result of the Merger, each holder of ARPI common stock received 1.135 of our Class A common shares for each share of ARPI common stock and each holder of limited partnership interests in ARPI s operating partnership received 1.135 Class A units of our operating partnership. We issued 36,546,170 Class A common shares and 1,343,843 Class A units in connection with the Merger, representing 12.7% of the total Class A common shares, Class B common shares and units of our operating partnership, collectively, as of the acquisition date (see Note 10). 
    
  Factors That Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
    
  Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include our ability to identify and acquire properties; our pace of property acquisitions; the time and cost required to gain access to the properties and then to renovate and lease a newly acquired property at acceptable rental rates; occupancy levels; rates of tenant turnover; the length of vacancy in properties between tenant leases; our expense ratios; our ability to raise capital; and our capital structure. 
    
  Property Acquisitions and Dispositions 
    
  Since our formation, we have rapidly but systematically grown our portfolio of single-family homes. Our ability to identify and acquire single-family homes that meet our investment criteria is impacted by home prices in our target markets, the inventory of properties available-for-sale through our acquisition channels, competition for our target assets and our available capital. Our level of acquisition activity has fluctuated based on the number of suitable investments and the level of capital available to invest. Our acquisition pace for individually acquired properties has decreased over the past year. During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , our total portfolio increased by   115   homes, including   246   homes acquired through trustee acquisitions,   172   homes acquired through bulk acquisitions,   153   homes acquired through broker acquisitions and net of   456   homes sold or rescinded, of which   312   properties were former ARPI properties. 
    
  Property Operations 
    
  The acquisition of properties involves expenditures in addition to payment of the purchase price, including property inspections, closing costs, liens, title insurance, transfer taxes, recording fees, broker commissions, property taxes and homeowner association ( HOA ) fees, when applicable. In addition, we typically incur costs between $5,000 and $25,000 to renovate a home to prepare it for rental. Renovation work varies, but may include paint, flooring, carpeting, cabinetry, appliances, plumbing hardware and other items required to prepare the home for rental. The time and cost involved in initially accessing our homes to prepare them for  
  
   23 

rental can impact our financial performance and varies among properties based on several factors, including the source of acquisition channel, whether the property is located in a judicial or non-judicial foreclosure state, if applicable, and whether or not the home is occupied at the time of acquisition. This process of finalizing the acquisition and gaining initial access to the home can range from immediate access to multiple months and, on average, takes approximately 15 to 25 days. Additionally, after gaining access to the home, the time to renovate a property can vary significantly among properties and is most impacted by the age and condition of the property. On average, it takes approximately 60 to 70 days to complete the renovation process after gaining initial access to the home. Our operating results are also impacted by the amount of time it takes to market and lease a property, which can vary greatly among properties, and is impacted by local demand, our marketing techniques and the size of our available inventory. On average, it takes approximately 20 to 30 days to lease a property after completing the renovation process. Lastly, our operating results are impacted by the length of stay of our tenants and the amount of time it takes to prepare and re-lease a property after a tenant vacates. This process, which we refer to as  turnover,  is impacted by numerous factors, including the condition of the home upon move-out of the previous tenant, and by local demand, our marketing techniques and the size of our available inventory at the time of the turnover. On average, it takes approximately 50 to 60 days to complete the turnover process. 
    
  Revenue 
    
  Our revenue is derived primarily from rents collected under lease agreements with tenants for our single-family properties. These include short-term leases that we enter into directly with our tenants, which typically have a term of one year. Our rental rates and occupancy levels are affected by macroeconomic factors and local and property-level factors, including market conditions, seasonality and tenant defaults, and the amount of time it takes to renovate and re-lease properties when tenants vacate. We generally do not offer free rent or other concessions in connection with leasing our properties. Additionally, our ability to collect revenues and related operating results are impacted by the credit worthiness and quality of our tenants. On average, our tenants have household incomes ranging from $70,000 to $100,000 and primarily consist of families with approximately two adults and one or more children. 
    
  In addition to rental revenues, we receive fees and other reimbursements, referred to as  tenant charge-backs , from our tenants, which are primarily designed to recover costs for certain items, such as utilities, damages and maintenance. In accordance with GAAP, these fees and tenant charge-backs are presented gross in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  As our total portfolio occupancy continues to stabilize, our ability to maintain and grow revenues will be dependent on our ability to retain tenants and increase rental rates. We believe that our platform will allow us to achieve strong tenant retention and lease renewal rates at our properties. The average increase in rent for renewals was   3.4%   and   3.3%  , respectively, and the average increase in rent for re-leases was   5.0%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Based on our Same-Home population of properties, we experienced retention rates of   67.6%   and   67.7%  , respectively, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The average increase in rent for renewals was   3.8%   and   3.0%  , respectively, and the average increase in rent for re-leases was   5.8%   and   3.8%  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Based on our Same-Home population of properties, we experienced retention rates of   68.4%   and   69.2%  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Expenses 
    
  We monitor the following categories of expenses that we believe most significantly affect our results of operations. 
          
  Property Operating Expenses 
    
  Once a property is available for lease, which we refer to as  rent-ready,  we incur ongoing property-related expenses, primarily HOA fees (when applicable); property taxes; insurance; marketing expenses; repairs and maintenance; and turnover costs, which may not be subject to our control. 
    
  Property Management Expenses 
    
  As we internally manage our portfolio of single-family properties through our proprietary property management platform, we incur costs such as salary expenses for property management personnel, lease expenses and operating costs for property management offices and technology expenses for maintaining the property management platform. As part of developing our property management platform, we have made significant investments in our infrastructure, systems and technology. We believe that these investments will enable the costs of our property management platform to become more efficient over time and as our overall portfolio grows in size. 
    
  Seasonality 
    
  We believe that our business and related operating results will be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year. In particular, we have experienced higher levels of tenant move-outs during the late spring and summer months, which impacts both our  
  
   24 

rental revenues and related turnover costs. Further, our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets for expenses such as HVAC repairs, turn costs and landscaping expenses during the summer season. 
          
  General and Administrative Expense 
    
  General and administrative expense primarily consists of payroll and personnel costs, trustees  and officers  insurance expenses, audit and tax fees, state taxes, trustee fees and other expenses associated with our corporate and administrative functions. 
    
  Results of Operations 
    
    Net loss attributable to common shareholders was   $21.2 million  , or   $0.09   per basic and diluted share, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of   $28.6 million  , or   $0.14   per basic and diluted share, for the     three months ended September 30, 2015  . This improvement was primarily attributable to higher revenues and a net gain on the sale of single-family properties, partially offset by increases in property operating and depreciation expenses resulting from growth in our property count, a rise in interest expense due to higher outstanding borrowings and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt. 
    
    Net loss attributable to common shareholders was   $35.9 million  , or   $0.15   per basic and diluted share, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of   $64.1 million  , or   $0.30   per basic and diluted share, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This improvement was primarily attributable to higher revenues, a net gain on the sale of single-family properties and a gain on the conversion of Series E convertible units into Series D convertible units, partially offset by increases in property operating and depreciation expenses resulting from growth in our property count, a rise in interest expense due to higher outstanding borrowings and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt. 
    
  As we continue to grow our portfolio with many of our homes still recently acquired and/or renovated, we distinguish our portfolio of homes between Same-Home properties, Non-Same-Home and Other properties and Former ARPI properties in evaluating our operating performance. We classify a property as Same-Home if it has been stabilized longer than 90 days prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented under comparison, which allows the performance of these properties to be compared between periods. Single-family properties that we acquire individually (i.e., not through a bulk purchase) are classified as either stabilized or non-stabilized. A property is classified as stabilized once it has been renovated and then initially leased or available for rent for a period greater than 90 days. We classify a property as Former ARPI if it was acquired through the ARPI merger and is not classified as held for sale as of the end of the current period. All other properties, including those classified as held for sale, are classified as Non-Same-Home and Other. 
    
  One of the primary financial measures we use in evaluating the operating performance of our single-family properties is core net operating income ( Core NOI ), which we define as rents and fees from single-family properties, net of bad debt expense, less property operating expenses for single-family properties, excluding expenses reimbursed by tenant charge-backs and bad debt expense.  We use Core NOI as a primary financial measure as it reflects the economic operating performance of our single-family properties without the impact of certain tenant reimbursed operating expenses that are presented gross in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in accordance with GAAP.

Comparison of the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016  , to the   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  The following table presents a summary of Core NOI for our Same-Home properties, Non-Same-Home and Other properties, Former ARPI properties and total properties for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

A reconciliation of Core NOI to net income or loss as determined in accordance with GAAP is located at the end of this Item 2  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Core Revenues from Single-Family Properties 
    
  Same-Home Properties 
    
  Core property revenues from Same-Home properties for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , increased   $5.6 million  , or   5.5%  , to   $107.2 million   from   $101.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This rise was primarily attributable to higher average monthly rental rates, which increased to   $1,496   per month as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1,443   per month as of   September 30, 2015  , and to higher average occupancy levels, which increased to   95.2%   as of   September 30, 2016  , from   94.1%   as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Non-Same Home and Other Properties 
    
  Core property revenues from Non-Same-Home and Other properties were   $60.5 million   and   $47.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in our average number of leased Non-Same-Home and Other properties, which rose to   13,135   leased properties for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   11,191   leased properties for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Core Property Operating Expenses 
    
  Core property operating expenses consist of direct property operating expenses, net of tenant charge-backs, and property management costs. 
    
  Same-Home Properties 
    
  Core property operating expenses from Same-Home properties for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , decreased   $0.9 million  , or   2.0%  , to $  41.8 million   from $  42.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Same-Home core property operating expenses as a percentage of total Same-Home core revenues from single-family properties decreased to   39.0%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   42.0%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily attributable to lower maintenance and turnover costs, net of tenant charge-backs, reduced property management expenses, as well as to higher core revenues from Same-Home properties. 
    
  Non-Same-Home and Other Properties 
    
  Core property operating expenses from Non-Same-Home and Other properties were   $23.0 million   and   $18.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. This increase was primarily attributable to growth in our average number of Non-Same-Home and Other properties, which rose to   13,911   properties for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   12,616   properties for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Non-Same-Home core property operating expenses as a percentage of total Non-Same-Home core revenues from single-family properties decreased to   38.0%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   40.1%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily attributable to higher core revenues from Non-Same-Home properties. 
     
  General and Administrative Expense 
    
  General and administrative expense, which primarily consists of payroll and personnel costs, trustees  and officers  insurance expense, audit and tax fees, state taxes, trustee fees and other expenses associated with our corporate and administrative functions, was   $7.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $6.1 million   for the same period in   2015  . This rise was primarily related to a   $0.9 million   increase in state taxes related to the growth of our portfolio. Annualized general and administrative expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , was   0.37%   of total quarter-end assets, compared to annualized general and administrative expense of   0.35%   of total quarter-end assets for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense was   $32.9 million   and   $23.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. This increase was primarily due to a rise in aggregate borrowings to   $2.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $2.5 billion   at   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Acquisition Fees and Costs Expensed 
    
  All costs of our internal acquisition function are expensed in accordance with GAAP. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , acquisition fees and costs expensed totaled   $1.8 million  , including   $0.5 million   of transaction costs related to the ARPI  
  
   27 

Merger and   $1.3 million   of other acquisition fees and costs expensed. For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , acquisition fees and costs expensed totaled   $4.2 million  , including   $4.1 million   of costs associated with purchases of single-family properties and   $0.1 million   of transaction costs related to portfolio and bulk transactions. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of buildings. Depreciation of our assets is calculated over their useful lives on a straight-line basis over 5 to 30 years. Our intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset s estimated economic useful life. Depreciation and amortization expense was   $75.4 million   and   $67.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. This increase was attributable to growth in our average number of depreciable properties.

  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  Our critical accounting policies are included in Item 7,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . There have been no significant changes to our policies during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see  Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies.  
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), which commenced with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We believe that we have operated, and continue to operate, in such a manner as to satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT. Accordingly, we will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that we qualify as a REIT and our distributions to our shareholders equal or exceed our REIT taxable income. 
    
  However, qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, including tests related to the percentage of income that we earn from specified sources and the percentage of our earnings that we distribute to our shareholders. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will continue to be organized or be able to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates, and we may be ineligible to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent tax years. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state or local income and capital taxes and U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income, if any. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS") will be subject to federal, state and local taxes on their income at regular corporate rates. The tax years from 2012 through   2015   remain open to examination by the taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. 
    
  ASC 740-10,   Income Taxes,   requires recognition of deferred tax assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, based solely on its technical merits, with the taxing authority having full authority of all relevant information. The measurement of a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold is based on a cumulative probability model under which the largest amount of tax benefit recognized is the amount with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no deferred tax assets and liabilities or unrecognized tax benefits recorded. We do not anticipate a significant change in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our liquidity and capital resources as of   September 30, 2016  , included cash and cash equivalents of $  106.3 million  . Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $75.0 million   was outstanding under our revolving credit facility, which provides for maximum borrowings of up to $650.0 million and   $250.0 million   was outstanding under our term loan facility, which provides for maximum borrowings of up to $350.0 million. 
        
  Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations, make distributions to our shareholders and meet other general requirements of our business. Our liquidity, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the acquisition, renovation and maintenance of our properties, HOA fees (as applicable), real estate taxes, non-recurring capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, general and administrative expenses, payment of quarterly dividends on our preferred shares, and payment of distributions to our Class A common shareholders. 
  
   31 

We seek to satisfy our liquidity needs through cash provided by operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, issuances of debt and equity securities (including OP units), asset-backed securitizations, property dispositions and joint venture transactions. We have financed our operations and acquisitions to date through the issuance of equity securities, borrowings under our credit facilities and asset-backed securitizations. Going forward, we expect to meet our operating liquidity requirements generally through cash on hand and cash provided by operations. We believe our rental income, net of operating expenses and recurring capital expenditures, will generally provide cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and dividend distributions. However, our real estate assets are illiquid in nature. A timely liquidation of assets might not be a viable source of short-term liquidity should a cash flow shortfall arise, and we may need to source liquidity from other financing alternatives. 
    
  To qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually to our shareholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and to pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we annually distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income. We intend to pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders, which in the aggregate are approximately equal to or exceed our net taxable income in the relevant year. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Our cash flows provided by operating activities depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy level of our properties, the rental rates achieved on our leases, the collection of rent from our tenants and the level of property operating expenses, property management operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $242.9 million  , which included inflows of   $230.1 million   from noncash adjustments to net income,   $11.7 million   from other changes in operating assets and liabilities and net income of   $1.1 million  . Net cash used for investing activities was   $452.0 million  , which primarily consisted of cash outflows of   $350.0 million   related to the payoff of the credit facility in connection with the ARPI Merger,   $188.7 million   related to the acquisition of properties,   $27.1 million   for the purchase of commercial real estate and   $21.7 million   of renovation costs to prepare our properties for rental, partially offset by cash inflows of   $71.9 million   of net proceeds received from the sales of single-family properties and   $44.5 million   of net proceeds received from the sales of non-performing loans. Renovation costs typically include paint, flooring, appliances, landscaping and other improvements. Net cash provided by financing activities was   $257.7 million  , which primarily consisted of cash inflows including   $482.8 million   of net proceeds from the issuance of perpetual preferred shares and   $325.0 million   of net borrowings against our revolving credit facilities and term loan facility, partially offset by cash outflows of   $374.0 million   for payments on our asset-backed securitizations and   $96.1 million   for repurchases of our Class A common shares. Net increase in cash and cash equivalents during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was   $48.6 million  . 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $155.9 million  , which included inflows of   $193.0 million   from noncash adjustments to net loss, partially offset by outflows of   $0.5 million   from other changes in operating assets and liabilities and a net loss of   $36.6 million  . Net cash used for investing activities was   $743.9 million  , which primarily consisted of cash outflows of   $555.0 million   related to the acquisition of properties and   $125.2 million   of renovation costs to prepare our properties for rental. These costs typically include paint, flooring, appliances, landscaping and other improvements. Net cash provided by financing activities was   $717.6 million  , which primarily consisted of cash inflows of   $1.0 billion   in proceeds from our securitization transactions in March 2015 and September 2015, partially offset by net repayments of borrowings under our credit facility of   $207.0 million  . Net increase in cash and cash equivalents during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , was $  129.6 million  . 
    
  Credit Facilities 
    
  In March 2013, the Company entered into a $500.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a financial institution, which was subsequently amended in September 2013 to, among other things, expand our borrowing capacity to $800.0 million and extend the repayment period to September 30, 2018. All borrowings under the revolving credit facility accrued interest at 1-month LIBOR plus 2.75% until March 2017, and thereafter at 1-month LIBOR plus 3.125%. The revolving credit facility was secured by our operating partnership s membership interests in entities that own certain of our single-family properties and required that we maintain certain financial covenants. In July 2016, the Company paid off the   $142.0 million   of borrowings that had been outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2016, using proceeds from our   6.35%   Series E perpetual preferred share offering, and terminated the revolving credit facility during August 2016. The termination of the revolving credit facility resulted in   $2.7 million   of charges during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , related to deferred financing cost write-offs, that were included in early extinguishment of debt within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  In August 2016, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion credit agreement providing for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million and a delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million. The interest rate on the revolving facility is, at the Company s election, a LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to  
  
   32 

2.30% or a base rate (generally determined according to a prime rate or federal funds rate) plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.30%. Loans under the term loan facility accrue interest, at the Company s election, at either a LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.70% to 2.30% or a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.70% to 1.30%. In each case, the actual margin is determined according to a ratio of the Company s total indebtedness to total asset value in effect from time to time. Based on current credit metrics for LIBOR based borrowings as of   September 30, 2016  , the revolving credit facility bears interest at 1-month LIBOR plus   1.85%  , and the term loan facility bears interest at 1-LIBOR plus   1.80%  . The revolving credit facility and the term loan facility have fully extended maturity dates of August 2020 and August 2021, respectively. The credit agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $75.0 million   outstanding borrowings against the revolving credit facility,   $250.0 million   outstanding borrowings against the term loan facility and was in compliance with all loan covenants. 
    
         Asset-Backed Securitization 
    
  In connection with the Merger with ARPI on February 29, 2016 (see Note 10), the Company assumed a securitization loan (the "ARP 2014-SFR1 securitization ), which involved the issuance and sale of single-family rental pass-through certificates that represent beneficial ownership interests in a loan secured by 2,875 homes held by a special purpose entity, ARP 2014-SFR1 Borrower, LLC (the  Borrower ). The Borrower under the loan was wholly owned by another special purpose entity (the  Equity Owner ) and the Equity Owner was wholly owned by the operating partnership. The loan, at the time of its origination by ARPI in August 2014, had an original principal amount of $342.2 million and an initial term of two years, with three, 12-month extension options, resulting in a fully extended maturity date of September 9, 2019. It was comprised of six floating rate components computed monthly based on 1-month LIBOR for each interest period plus a fixed component spread for each of the six components resulting in an effective weighted-average interest rate of 1-month LIBOR plus 2.11%. Interest on the loan was paid monthly. In September 2016, the Company paid off the ARP 2014-SFR1 asset-backed securitization using available cash and borrowings from our credit facilities, which resulted in a   $10.7 million   loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of the discount on the securitization. The payoff of the ARP 2014-SFR1 asset-backed securitization resulted in the release of the   2,875   collateralized homes and   $10.1 million   of restricted cash for lender requirements. 
    
  Exchangeable Senior Notes, Net 
    
  In connection with the Merger with ARPI on February 29, 2016 (see Note 10), the Company assumed 3.25% exchangeable senior notes due 2018 that have a $115.0 million aggregate principal amount and a fair value at assumption of   $112.3 million  . The exchangeable senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the operating partnership and rank equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the operating partnership. Interest is payable in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning May 15, 2016, until the maturity date of November 15, 2018. The operating partnership s obligations under the exchangeable senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. The exchangeable senior notes bear interest at a rate of 3.25% per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature, which provides that the exchangeable senior notes may, under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at the option of the operating partnership, based on an initial exchange rate of   46.9423   shares of ARPI's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. The adjusted initial exchange rate would be 53.2795 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, based on the 1.135 exchange ratio of ARPI shares to our shares resulting from our merger with ARPI. The current exchange rate as of   September 30, 2016  , was   54.6381   shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes. The exchange rate changes over time based on our common share price and distributions to common shareholders. The exchangeable senior notes will be exchangeable for our common shares based on certain triggering events (see Note 6). 
    
  The fair value of the exchangeable senior notes, which was calculated using a binomial lattice model at the time of assumption, was $112.3 million, which represents the $115.0 million face value less a discount of $2.7 million, which will be amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The amount recorded to exchangeable senior notes, net at the time of assumption was $105.3 million, which represents the fair value of $112.3 million, less the fair value of the exchange settlement feature of the notes of $7.0 million, which was calculated using a straight-debt rate of 6.7% at the time of assumption. The fair value of the exchange settlement feature was recorded in additional paid-in capital and will be amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the notes.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the exchangeable senior notes, net had a balance of   $107.3 million   in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, which was net of an unamortized discount of   $2.1 million   and   $5.6 million   of unamortized fair value of the exchange settlement feature, which was included in additional paid-in capital within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Share Repurchase Program 
    
  On   September 21, 2015  , the Company announced that our Board of Trustees approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to   $300.0 million   of our outstanding Class A common shares from time to time in the open market or  
  
   33 

in privately negotiated transactions. We repurchased and retired   6.2 million   of our Class A common shares, on a settlement date basis, at a weighted-average price of   $15.44   per share and a total price of   $96.0 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , in accordance with the program. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we repurchased and retired approximately   3.4 million   of our Class A common shares, in accordance with the program at a weighted-average price of   $15.76   per share and a total price of   $53.7 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a remaining repurchase authorization of   $146.7 million   under the program (see Note 8).  
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have no obligations, assets or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. 
    
  Non-GAAP Measures 
    
  Core Net Operating Income ("Core NOI"), Same-Home Core NOI and Same-Home Core NOI after capital expenditures 
    
  Core NOI and Same-Home Core NOI are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that we define as rents and fees from single-family properties, net of bad debt expense, less property operating expenses for single-family properties, excluding expenses reimbursed by tenant charge-backs and bad debt expense.     A property is classified as Same-Home if it has been stabilized longer than 90 days prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented under comparison. A property is removed from Same-Home if it has been classified as held for sale or has been taken out of service as a result of a casualty loss.     Single-family properties that we acquire individually (i.e., not through a bulk purchase) are classified as either stabilized or non-stabilized. A property is classified as stabilized once it has been renovated and then initially leased or available for rent for a period greater than 90 days.    
    
  Core NOI and Same-Home Core NOI also excludes (1)   noncash fair value adjustments associated with remeasuring our Series E convertible units liability and preferred shares derivative liability to fair value  , (2) noncash gain or loss on conversion of convertible units, (3) gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, (4) gain or loss on sale of single-family properties, (5) depreciation and amortization, (6) acquisition fees and costs expensed   incurred with recent business combinations and the acquisition of individual properties  , (7) noncash share-based compensation expense, (8) interest expense, (9) general and administrative expense, (10) other expenses and (11) other revenues. We further adjust Same-Home Core NOI by subtracting capital expenditures to calculate Same-Home Core NOI after capital expenditures, which we believe is a meaningful supplemental non-GAAP financial measure because it more fully reflects our operating performance after the impact of all property-level expenditures, regardless of whether they are capitalized or expensed.    
    
  We consider Core NOI, Same-Home Core NOI and Same-Home Core NOI after capital expenditures to be meaningful financial measures because we believe they are helpful to investors in understanding the operating performance of our single-family properties without the impact of certain operating expenses that are reimbursed through tenant charge-backs.    
    
  Core NOI, Same-Home Core NOI and Same-Home Core NOI after capital expenditures should be considered only as supplements to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance. Core NOI, Same-Home Core NOI and Same-Home Core NOI after capital expenditures should not be used as measures of our liquidity, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. Core NOI, Same-Home Core NOI and Same-Home Core NOI after capital expenditures also should not be used as substitutes for net income (loss) or net cash flows from operating activities (as computed in accordance with GAAP).    
  
   34 

The following is a reconciliation of Core NOI, Same-Home Core NOI and Same-Home Core NOI after capital expenditures to net loss attributable to common shareholders as determined in accordance with GAAP for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands): 

(1) 
    Beginning January 1, 2016, property operating expenses for vacant single-family properties have been included in property operating expenses and other expenses have been included in other expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
       
  FFO / Core FFO / Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders 
    
  FFO attributable to common share and unit holders is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate in accordance with the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), which defines FFO  as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, gains and losses from sales or impairment of  real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.     
    
  Core FFO attributable to common share and unit holders is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental measure of our performance. We compute this metric by adjusting FFO attributable to common share and unit holders for (1) acquisition fees and costs expensed incurred with recent business combinations and the acquisition of individual properties, (2) noncash share-based compensation expense, (3) noncash interest expense related to acquired debt, (4) gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, (5) noncash gain or loss on conversion of convertible units and (6) noncash fair value adjustments associated with remeasuring our Series E convertible units liability and preferred shares derivative liability to fair value.    
    
  Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental measure of our performance.  We compute this metric by adjusting Core FFO attributable to common share and unit holders for (1)  
  
   35 

recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value and maintain functionality of our properties and (2) actual leasing costs incurred during the period. As many of our homes are still recently acquired and / or renovated, we estimate recurring capital expenditures for our entire portfolio by multiplying (a) current period actual capital expenditures per Same-Home property by (b) our total number of properties, excluding non-stabilized and held for sale properties.    
    
  We present FFO attributable to common share and unit holders   because we consider this metric to be an important measure of the performance of real estate companies, as do many analysts in evaluating the Company. We believe that FFO attributable to common share and unit holders is a helpful measure of a REIT s performance   since this metric excludes depreciation, which is included in computing net income and assumes the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time.  We believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions and in response to inflation.    
    
  We also believe that Core FFO and Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders   are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of the Company as they allow investors to compare our operating performance to prior reporting periods without the effect of certain items that, by nature, are not comparable from period to period.     
    
  FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders are not a substitute for net cash flow provided by operating activities or net income (loss) per share, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of our liquidity, operating performance or ability to pay dividends. These metrics also are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. Because other REITs may not compute these measures in the same manner, they may not be comparable among REITs.    
    
  The following is a reconciliation of net loss attributable to common shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, to FFO attributable to common share and unit holders, Core FFO attributable to common share and unit holders and Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands): 

EBITDA / Adjusted EBITDA 
    
    EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is used by us and others as a supplemental measure of performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting EBITDA for (1) acquisition fees and costs expensed incurred with recent business combinations and the acquisition of individual properties, (2) net gain or loss on sale / impairment of single-family properties, (3) noncash share-based compensation expense, (4) gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, (5) gain or loss on conversion of convertible units and (6) noncash fair value adjustments associated with remeasuring our Series E convertible units liability and preferred shares derivative liability to fair value. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a meaningful financial measure of operating performance because it excludes the impact of various income and expense items that are not indicative of operating performance.     

36 

The following is a reconciliation of net loss attributable to common shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands):

ITEM 3.                               Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk, which may result from many factors, including government monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond our control. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future, including additional amounts that we may borrow under our revolving credit and term loan facilities. In addition, decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of single-family homes, which may lead to future acquisitions being costlier and resulting in lower yields on single-family homes targeted for acquisition. Significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to acquire single-family homes with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the total outstanding balance of our variable-rate debt was comprised of borrowings on our revolving credit facility of   $75.0 million   and   zero  , respectively, our term loan facility of   $250.0 million   and   zero  , respectively, and AH4R 2014-SFR1 securitization of   $458.0 million   and   $473.8 million  , respectively.  All borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.30% or a base rate (generally determined according to a prime rate or federal funds rate) plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.30% until   the fully extended maturity date of   August 2020, the term loan facility bears interest at a LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.70% to 2.30% or a base rate (generally determined according to a prime rate or federal funds rate) plus a margin ranging from 0.70% to 1.30% until   the fully extended maturity date of   August 2021, and the AH4R 2014-SFR1 securitization bears interest at a duration-weighted blended interest rate of 1-month LIBOR plus 1.54%. Assuming no change in the outstanding balance of our existing variable-rate debt, the following table illustrates the effect of a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the LIBOR rate on our projected annual interest expense as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Calculation of additional projected annual interest expense as a result of a 100 basis point increase reflects the potential impact of our interest rate cap agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (2) 
    Calculation of projected decrease in annual interest expense as a result of a 100 basis point decrease is reflective of any LIBOR floors or minimum interest rates stated in the agreements of respective borrowings. 
       
  These analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, because of the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure. 

ITEM 4.                               Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file and submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in accordance with SEC guidelines and that such information is communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures in reaching that level of reasonable assurance. 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at a reasonable assurance level. 

38 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
