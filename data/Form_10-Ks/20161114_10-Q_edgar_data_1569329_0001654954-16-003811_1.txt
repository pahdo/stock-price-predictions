Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Description of
Business 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim
financial information. Accordingly, certain information and
footnote disclosures, normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules
and regulations. 

The statements presented as of September 30, 2016 and for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. In
the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all
normal recurring and other adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation, and to make the financial statements not misleading.
These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements
included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. The results for interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results for the entire
year. 

Certain reclassifications have been made to conform to the current
year presentations including the Company s adoption of
Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15,
pertaining to the presentation of debt issuance costs with
retrospective application effective January 1, 2016. This resulted
in a reclassification   from prepaid expenses
and other assets to convertible notes payable, net of debt
discount  . Refer below to
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  of the
notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for
further details. These reclassifications did not affect revenue,
total costs and expenses, income (loss) from operations, or net
income (loss).  

The Company consolidates all majority owned subsidiaries,
investments in entities in which we have controlling influence and
variable interest entities where we have been determined to be the
primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Nature of Business 

Youngevity International, Inc. (the  Company ), founded
in 1996, develops and distributes nutritional supplements, sports
and energy drinks, health and wellness, weight loss, gourmet
coffee, skincare and cosmetics, lifestyle services, digital
products including scrap books and memory books, packaged foods,
pharmacy discount cards, clothing and jewelry line products through
its global independent direct selling network, also known as
multi-level marketing, and sells coffee products to commercial
customers.  The Company operates in two business
segments, its direct selling segment where products are offered
through a global distribution network of preferred customers and
distributors and its commercial coffee segment where products are
sold directly to businesses. In the following text, the terms
 we,   our,  and  us  may
refer, as the context requires, to the Company or collectively to
the Company and its subsidiaries. 

The Company operates through the following domestic wholly-owned
subsidiaries: AL Global Corporation, which operates our direct
selling networks, CLR Roasters, LLC ( CLR ), our
commercial coffee business, Financial Destination, Inc., FDI
Management, Inc., and MoneyTrax LLC (collectively referred to as
 FDI ), 2400 Boswell LLC, MK Collaborative LLC,
Youngevity Global LLC and the wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries

Mexico S.A. de CV, Youngevity Israel, Ltd., Youngevity Russia LLC,
Youngevity Colombia S.A.S., Youngevity International Singapore Pte.
Ltd., Mialisia Canada, Inc., and Legacy for Life Limited (Hong
Kong).

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
( GAAP ) requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expense for each reporting period.  Estimates are used in
accounting for, among other things, allowances for doubtful
accounts, deferred taxes, and related valuation allowances,
fair value of derivative liabilities, uncertain tax positions, loss
contingencies, fair value of options granted under our stock based
compensation plan, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in
business combinations, capital leases, asset impairments, estimates
of future cash flows used to evaluate impairments, useful lives of
property, equipment and intangible assets, value of contingent
acquisition debt, inventory obsolescence, and sales
returns.   

Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts and
such differences may be material to the consolidated financial
statements. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed
periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected
prospectively in the period they occur. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers only its monetary liquid assets with original
maturities of three months or less as cash and cash
equivalents. 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable
to common stockholders by the sum of the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during the period and the
weighted-average number of dilutive common share equivalents
outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method.
Dilutive common share equivalents are comprised of in-the-money
stock options, warrants and convertible preferred stock, based on
the average stock price for each period using the treasury stock
method. 

The incremental dilutive common share equivalents for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 were 7,845,400 and 7,491,263,
respectively. 

The incremental dilutive common share equivalents for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 were 12,098,454. The Company
incurred a loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and
therefore, 8,890,982 common share equivalents were not included in
the weighted-average calculation since their effect would have been
anti-dilutive. 

Stock Based Compensation 

The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718,
   Compensation   Stock
Compensation,    which
establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for
employee services. Under such provisions, stock based compensation
cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair
value of the award, and is recognized as an expense, under the
straight-line method, over the vesting period of the equity
grant.  

The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees
in accordance with authoritative guidance for equity based payments
to non-employees. Stock options issued to non-employees are
accounted for at their estimated fair value, determined using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of options
granted to non-employees is re-measured as they vest, and the
resulting increase in value, if any, is recognized as expense
during the period the related services are rendered.

Factoring Agreement 

The Company has a factoring agreement ( Factoring
Agreement ) with Crestmark Bank ( Crestmark )
related to the Company s accounts receivable resulting from
sales of certain products within its commercial coffee segment.
Effective May 1, 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment
to the factoring agreement ( Agreement ). Under the
terms of the Agreement, all new receivables assigned to Crestmark
shall be  Client Risk Receivables  and no further
credit approvals will be provided by Crestmark and there will be no
new credit-approved receivables. The changes to the Agreement
include expanding the factoring facility to include borrowings to
be advanced against acceptable eligible inventory up to 50% of
landed cost of finished goods inventory and meeting certain
criteria, not to exceed the lesser of $1,000,000 or 85% of the
value of the receivables already advanced with a maximum overall
borrowing of $3,000,000. Interest accrues on the outstanding
balance and a factoring commission is charged for each invoice
factored which is calculated as the greater of $5.00 or 0.75% to
1.00% of the gross invoice amount and is recorded as interest
expense. In addition Youngevity Inc. has entered into a Guaranty
and Security Agreement with Crestmark Bank if in the event that CLR
were to default. This Agreement continues in full force and is
effective until February 1, 2019. 

The Company accounts for the sale of receivables under the
Factoring Agreement as secured borrowings with a pledge of the
subject inventories and receivables as well as all bank deposits as
collateral, in accordance with the authoritative guidance for
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishments of liabilities. The caption  Accounts
receivable, due from factoring company  on the accompanying
condensed consolidated balance sheets in the amount of
approximately $1,442,000 and $556,000 as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively, reflects the related
collateralized accounts. 

The Company's outstanding liability related to the Factoring
Agreement was approximately $1,588,000 and $457,000 as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is included in
other current liabilities, net on the condensed consolidated
balance sheets. 

Plantation Costs 

The Company s commercial coffee segment, CLR, includes the
results of the Siles Plantation Family Group ( Siles ),
which is a 450 acre coffee plantation and a dry-processing facility
located on 26 acres both located in Matagalpa, Nicaragua. Siles is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of CLR, and the results of
CLR include the depreciation and amortization of capitalized
costs, development and maintenance and harvesting costs of
Siles.  In accordance with GAAP, plantation maintenance and
harvesting costs for commercially producing coffee farms are
charged against earnings when sold. Deferred harvest costs
accumulate throughout the year, and are expensed over the remainder
of the year as the coffee is sold. The difference between actual
harvest costs incurred and the amount of harvest costs recognized
as expense is recorded as either an increase or decrease in
deferred harvest costs, which is reported as an asset and included
with prepaid expenses and other current assets in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets. Once the harvest is complete, the
harvest cost is then recognized as the inventory
value. 

In April 2015, the Company completed the 2015 coffee harvest in
Nicaragua and approximately $723,000 of deferred harvest costs were
reclassified as inventory during the quarter ended June 30, 2015.
The remaining inventory as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 is $144,000 and $192,000, respectively. 

In May 2016, the Company completed the 2016 coffee harvest in
Nicaragua and approximately $650,000 of deferred harvest costs were
reclassified as inventory during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
The remaining inventory as of September 30, 2016 is
$41,000. 

Costs associated with the 2017 harvest as of September 30, 2016
total approximately $188,000 and are included in prepaid expenses
and other current assets as deferred harvest costs on the
Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Related Party Transactions 

Our coffee segment CLR is associated with Hernandez, Hernandez,
Export Y Company ( H H ), a Nicaragua company,
through sourcing arrangements to procure Nicaraguan green coffee
and in March 2014 as part of the Siles acquisition, CLR
engaged H H as employees to manage Siles. The Company made
purchases of approximately $2,700,000 and $7,400,000 from this
supplier for the three months and nine months ended September 30,
2016, respectively. In addition, for the three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, CLR sold $0 and $2,200,000
respectively, in green coffee to H H Coffee Group Export, a
Florida Company which is affiliated with H H. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the
following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and
collectability is reasonably assured. The Company ships the
majority of its direct selling segment products directly to the
distributors via UPS or USPS and receives substantially all
payments for these sales in the form of credit card transactions.
The Company regularly monitors its use of credit card or merchant
services to ensure that its financial risk related to credit
quality and credit concentrations is actively managed. Revenue is
recognized upon passage of title and risk of loss to customers when
product is shipped from the fulfillment facility. The Company ships
the majority of its coffee segment products via common carrier and
invoices its customer for the products. Revenue is recognized when
the title and risk of loss is passed to the customer under the
terms of the shipping arrangement, typically, FOB shipping
point. 

Sales revenue and a reserve for estimated returns are recorded net
of sales tax when product is shipped. 

Deferred Revenues and Costs 

Deferred revenues relate primarily to the Heritage Makers product
line and represent the Company s obligation for points
purchased by customers that have not yet been redeemed for product.
Cash received for points sold is recorded as deferred revenue.
Revenue is recognized when customers redeem the points and the
product is shipped. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the balance in deferred revenues was approximately $1,928,000 and
$2,580,000 respectively, of which the portion attributable to
Heritage Makers was approximately $1,928,000 and $2,485,000,
respectively. The remaining balance of approximately
$95,000 as of December 31, 2015, related primarily to the
Company s 2016 conventions whereby attendees pre-enroll in
the events and the Company does not recognize this revenue until
the conventions occur. 

Deferred costs relate to Heritage Makers prepaid commissions that
are recognized in expense at the time the related revenue is
recognized. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
balance in deferred costs was approximately $561,000 and $967,000,
respectively, and was included in prepaid expenses and current
assets. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ),
which are adopted by the Company as of the specified date. Unless
otherwise discussed, management believes the impact of recently
issued standards, some of which are not yet effective, will not
have a material impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements upon adoption. 

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ,
which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash
receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This
guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently
assessing the impact of this guidance. 

-8- 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Simplifying the Transition to
the Equity Method of Accounting   ( ASU 2016-07 ). ASU 2016-07
eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for
use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of
ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust
the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings
retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had
been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had
been held. ASU 2016-07 requires that the equity method investor add
the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to
the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and
adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment
becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon
qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive
adjustment of the investment is required. ASU 2016-17 requires that
an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that
becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize
through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated
other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes
qualified for use of the equity method. ASU 2016-07 is effective
for the Company s financial statements for annual and interim
periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and must be
applied prospectively. The Company is currently assessing the
impact of this guidance.   

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
   Compensation - Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting    ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09
simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is
effective for us beginning January 1, 2017. Early adoption is
permitted.     The Company is currently assessing the impact of
this guidance.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842). 
 The amendments in this ASU changes the
existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including
requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets
and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The guidance is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018. The new leases standard requires a modified
retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or
entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option
to use certain transition relief.  The Company is currently
assessing the impact of this guidance.   

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which
requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it
expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing
revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes
effective. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of
the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard. The new
standard will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2018
and the Company has the option to adopt it effective January 1,
2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or
cumulative effect transition method. In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus
Net) ( ASU 2016-08 ), which clarifies the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in
the new revenue recognition standard. ASU 2016-08 clarifies how an
entity should identify the unit of accounting (i.e., the specified
good or service) for the principal versus agent evaluation and how
it should apply the control principle to certain types of
arrangements. In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ( ASU
2016-10 ), which amends certain aspects of the guidance on
identifying performance obligations and the implementation guidance
on licensing. The Company is evaluating the effect the ASUs will
have on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.     The Company is
currently assessing the impact of this
guidance.   

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of
Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt
Issuance Costs   to simplify the
presentation of debt issuance costs. The amendments in the update
require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt
liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction
of the carrying amount of     the debt. Recognition and measurement of debt
issuance costs were not affected     by this amendment. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU
2015-15,  Presentation and     Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs
Associated With Line-of-Credit Arrangements-Amendments to SEC
Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at     June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting  which clarified
that the SEC would not object to an     entity deferring and presenting debt issuance
costs as an asset and subsequently     amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs
ratably over the term of the     line-of-credit arrangement.   ASU 2015-03 represents
a change in accounting principle and was effective on January 1,
2016 and was applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU
2015-03 resulted in a retrospective reclassification of our debt
issuance costs as described above from prepaid expenses and other
assets to convertible notes payable, net of debt discount on our
December 31, 2015 balance sheet in the amount of
$1,456,000.

Note
2.    Income
Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC
Topic 740,    Income Taxes,  
 under the asset and liability method
which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been included in the condensed consolidated financial
statements. Under this approach, deferred taxes are recorded for
the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The
provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable
for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the
year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are adjusted
for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. The
effects of future changes in income tax laws or rates are not
anticipated.  

Income taxes for the interim periods are computed using the
effective tax rates estimated to be applicable for the full fiscal
year, as adjusted for any discrete taxable events that occur during
the period. 

The Company files income tax returns in the United States
( U.S. ) on a federal basis and in many U.S. state and
foreign jurisdictions. Certain tax years remain open to examination
by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is
subject. 

Note
3.    Inventory and
Costs of Revenues   

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out method. The Company
records an inventory reserve for estimated excess and obsolete
inventory based upon historical turnover, market conditions and
assumptions about future demand for its products. When applicable,
expiration dates of certain inventory items with a definite life
are taken into consideration. 

Inventories consist of the following (in thousands): 

Cost of revenues includes the cost of inventory, shipping and
handling costs, royalties associated with certain products,
transaction banking costs, warehouse labor costs and depreciation
on certain assets. 

Note 4. Acquisitions and Business Combinations 

The Company accounts for business combinations under the
acquisition method and allocates the total purchase price for
acquired businesses to the tangible and identified intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated
fair values. When a business combination includes the exchange of
the Company s common stock, the value of the common stock is
determined using the closing market price as of the date such
shares were tendered to the selling parties. The fair values
assigned to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are based on management or third-party
estimates and assumptions that utilize established valuation
techniques appropriate for the Company s industry and each
acquired business. Goodwill is recorded as the excess, if any, of
the aggregate fair value of consideration exchanged for an acquired
business over the fair value (measured as of the acquisition date)
of total net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. A
liability for contingent consideration, if applicable, is recorded
at fair value as of the acquisition date. In determining the fair
value of such contingent consideration, management estimates the
amount to be paid based on probable outcomes and expectations on
financial performance of the related acquired business. The fair
value of contingent consideration is reassessed quarterly, with any
change in the estimated value charged to operations in the period
of the change. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the
contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in
actual or estimated revenue streams, discount periods, discount
rates and probabilities that contingencies will be
met.

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into
four acquisitions, which are described below. The acquisitions were
conducted in an effort to expand the Company s distributor
network, enhance and expand its product portfolio,
and diversify its product mix.  As such, the major
purpose for the Company s business combination was to
increase revenue and profitability. The acquisitions were
structured as asset purchases which resulted in the recognition of
certain intangible assets.   

Legacy for Life, LLC 

On
August 18, 2016, with an effective date of September 1, 2016 the
Company entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of
Legacy for Life, LLC, an Oklahoma based direct-sales company and
entered into an agreement to acquire the equity of two wholly owned
subsidiaries of Legacy for Life, LLC; Legacy for Life Taiwan and
Legacy for Life Limited (Hong Kong) collectively referred to as
( Legacy for Life ).  

Legacy for Life is a  science-based direct seller of i26, a
product made from the patented IgY Max formula or hyperimmune whole
dried egg, which is the key ingredient in Legacy for Life products.
Additionally, the Company has entered into an Ingredient Supply
Agreement to market i26 worldwide. IgY Max promotes healthy gut
flora and healthy digestion and was created by exposing a specially
selected flock of chickens to natural elements from the human
world, whereby the chickens develop immunity to these elements. In
a highly patented process, these special eggs are harvested as a
whole food and are processed as a whole food into i26 egg powder,
an all-natural product. Nothing is added to the egg nor does any
chemical extraction take place. 

As
a result of this acquisition, the Company s distributors and
customers have access to the unique line of the Legacy for Life
products and the Legacy for Life distributors and customers have
gained access to products offered by the Company. The Company has
agreed to purchase certain inventories and assume certain
liabilities. The Company is obligated to make monthly payments
based on a percentage of the Legacy for Life distributor revenue
derived from sales of the Company s products and a percentage
of royalty revenue derived from sales of the Legacy for Life
products until the earlier of the date that is fifteen (15) years
from the closing date or such time as the Company has paid to
Legacy for Life aggregate cash payments of Legacy for Life
distributor revenue and royalty revenue equal to a predetermined
maximum aggregate purchase price.   

The acquisition of Legacy for Life was accounted
for under the acquisition method of accounting.   The assets acquired and liabilities
assumed by the Company were recognized at their estimated fair
values as of the acquisition date.   The fair values of the acquired assets have not
been finalized pending further information that may impact the
valuation of certain assets or liabilities.     The acquisition related costs, such as legal costs
and other professional fees were minimal and expensed as
incurred.    

The contingent consideration s estimated fair value at the
date of acquisition was $825,000 as determined by management using
a discounted cash flow methodology. In addition the Company paid
$221,000 for the net assets of the Taiwan and Hong Kong entities
and certain inventories from Legacy for Life. 

The preliminary purchase price allocation for the acquisition of
Legacy for Life (in thousands) is as follows:

Note 5. Intangible Assets and Goodwill 

Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets are comprised of distributor organizations,
trademarks and tradenames, customer relationships and internally
developed software.  The Company's acquired intangible
assets, which are subject to amortization over their estimated
useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
intangible asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognized when the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds
its fair value. 

Intangible assets consist of the following (in
thousands): 

Amortization expense related to intangible assets was approximately
$537,000 and $560,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. Amortization expense related to intangible
assets was approximately $1,746,000 and $1,578,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

Trade names, which do not have legal, regulatory, contractual,
competitive, economic, or other factors that limit the useful lives
are considered indefinite lived assets and are not amortized but
are tested for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these
assets may not be recoverable. Approximately $2,267,000 in
trademarks from business combinations have been identified as
having indefinite lives. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill is recorded as the excess, if any, of the
aggregate fair value of consideration exchanged for an acquired
business over the fair value (measured as of the acquisition date)
of total net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) ASC Topic 350,    Intangibles - Goodwill
and Other ,   goodwill and
other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but
are tested for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these
assets may not be recoverable. The Company conducts annual reviews
for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth
quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully
recoverable.    

The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether
it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that
goodwill is impaired. After considering the totality of events and
circumstances, the Company determines whether it is more likely
than not that goodwill is not impaired.  If impairment is
indicated, then the Company conducts the two-step impairment
testing process. The first step compares the Company s fair
value to its net book value. If the fair value is less than the net
book value, the second step of the test compares the implied fair
value of the Company s goodwill to its carrying amount. If
the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the
Company would recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess
amount. The testing is generally performed at the  reporting
unit  level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a
business one level below that operating segment (referred to as a
component) if discrete financial information is prepared and
regularly reviewed by management at the component level. The
Company has determined that its reporting units for goodwill
impairment testing are the Company s reportable segments. As
such, the Company analyzed its goodwill balances separately for the
commercial coffee reporting unit and the direct selling reporting
unit. The goodwill balance as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 was $6,323,000. There were no triggering events indicating
impairment of goodwill or intangible assets during the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Goodwill intangible assets consist of the following (in
thousands):

Note 6. Debt 

Our total convertible notes payable, net of debt discount
outstanding consisted of the amount set forth in the following
table (in thousands): 

(1) 

Principal amount of $4,750,000 are net of unamortized debt
discounts of $2,691,000 as of September 30, 2016 and
$3,404,000 as of December 31, 2015.  

(2) 

Principal amount of approximately $7,188,000 are net of unamortized
debt discounts of $215,000 as of September 30, 2016 and
$292,000 as of December 31, 2015.  

(3) 

As
of January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03 with retrospective
application. This resulted in a $1,456,000 reclassification from
prepaid expenses and other current assets to convertible notes
payable, net of debt discount, for unamortized debt issuance
costs. 

(4) 

Principal
amounts are net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs of
$3,996,000 as of September 30, 2016 and $5,152,000 as of December
31, 2015.

principal and unpaid interest due at maturity on October 12, 2018.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the principal amount
of $7,187,500 remains outstanding. 

July 2014 Private Placement 

Between July 31, 2014 and September 10, 2014 the
Company entered into Note Purchase Agreements (the
 Note  or  Notes ) related to
its private placement offering ( 2014 Private
Placement ) with seven accredited investors pursuant to which
the Company raised aggregate gross proceeds of $4,750,000 and sold
units consisting of five (5) year senior secured convertible Notes
in the aggregate principal amount of $4,750,000, that are

annum and interest is paid quarterly in arrears with all principal
and unpaid interest due between July and September 2019. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the principal amount of
$4,750,000 remains outstanding.

Notes Payable 

January 2015 Private Placement 

In January 2015, the Company entered into Note Purchase Agreements
(the  Note  or  Notes ) related to its
private placement offering ( January 2015 Private
Placement ) with three (3) accredited investors pursuant to
which the Company sold units consisting of one (1) year senior
secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5,250,000. One
holder of a January 2015 Note in the principal amount of $5,000,000
was prepaid on October 26, 2015 through a cash payment from us to
the investor of $1,000,000 and the remaining $4,000,000 owed was
applied to the investor s purchase of a $4,000,000 November
2015 Note in the November 2015 Private Placement and a November
2015 Warrant exercisable to purchase 5,333,333 shares of Common
Stock. The Notes bore interest at a rate of eight percent (8%) per
annum and interest was paid quarterly in 2015. The remaining
balance of the January 2015 Notes as of December 31, 2015 was
$250,000 and was paid in January 2016. 

Note 7. Derivative Liability 

The Company accounted for the warrants issued in conjunction
with our November 2015 and July 2014 Private Placement s in
accordance with the accounting guidance for derivatives ASC Topic
815. The accounting guidance sets forth a two-step model to be
applied in determining whether a financial instrument is indexed to
an entity s own stock, which would qualify such financial
instruments for a scope exception. This scope exception specifies
that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a
derivative financial instrument would not be considered as such if
the contract is both (i) indexed to the entity s own
stock and (ii) classified in the stockholders  equity
section of the entity s balance sheet. The
Company determined the warrants related to Notes are
ineligible for equity classification due to anti-dilution
provisions set forth therein. 

The Company revalued the warrants as of the end of each reporting
period, and the estimated fair value of the outstanding warrant
liabilities was approximately $4,181,000 and $4,716,000 as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.  

Increases or decreases in fair value of the derivative liability
are included as a component of total other expense in the
accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations
for the respective period. The changes to the derivative
liability for warrants resulted in a decreases of $369,000 and
$1,069,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and a decrease of $535,000 as compared to an increase
of $1,232,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. 

Various factors are considered in the pricing models we use to
value the warrants, including our current stock price, the
remaining life of the warrants, the volatility of our stock price,
and the risk free interest rate. Future changes in these factors
may have a significant impact on the computed fair value of the
warrant liability. As such, we expect future changes in the fair
value of the warrants to continue and may vary significantly from
period to period. The warrant liability and revaluations have
not had a cash impact on our working capital, liquidity or business
operations. 

Warrants classified as derivative liabilities are recorded at their
estimated fair value (see Note 8, below) at the issuance date and
are revalued at each subsequent reporting date. We will continue to
revalue the derivative liability on each subsequent balance sheet
date until the securities to which the derivative liabilities
relate are exercised or expire. 

The estimated fair value of the warrants were computed as
of September 30, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015 using
Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo option pricing models, using the
following assumptions: 

In addition, Management assessed the probabilities of future
financing assumptions in the valuation models.

Note 8.   Fair Value of Financial
Instruments 

Fair value measurements are performed in accordance with the
guidance provided by ASC Topic 820,    Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures.    ASC
Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received
from selling an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market
prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters.
Where observable prices or parameters are not available, valuation
models are applied.  

ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an
entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Assets and
liabilities recorded at fair value in the financial statements are
categorized based upon the hierarchy of levels of judgment
associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.
Hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity
associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and
liabilities, are as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to
access. 

Level 2   Observable inputs other than quoted prices included
in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or
similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
observable market data. 

Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supportable by little
or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of
the asset or liability. 

The carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, capital lease obligations and
deferred revenue approximate their fair values based on their
short-term nature. The carrying amount of the Company s long
term notes payable approximates its fair value based on interest
rates available to the Company for similar debt instruments and
similar remaining maturities. 

The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to
the Company's business combinations is recorded using significant
unobservable measures and other fair value inputs and is therefore
classified as a Level 3 financial instrument. 

In connection with the 2015 and 2014 Private Placements, we issued
warrants to purchase shares of our common stock which are accounted
for as derivative liabilities (see Note 7 above.) The estimated
fair value of the warrants is recorded using significant
unobservable measures and other fair value inputs and is therefore
classified as a Level 3 financial instrument. 

We used Level 3 inputs for the valuation methodology of the
derivative liabilities. Our derivative liabilities are adjusted to
reflect estimated fair value at each period end, with any decrease
or increase in the estimated fair value being recorded in other
income or expense accordingly, as adjustments to the fair value of
the derivative liabilities. 

-18- 

The following table details the fair value measurement within the
three levels of the value hierarchy of the Company s
financial instruments, which includes the Level 3 liabilities (in
thousands): 

The
fair value of the contingent acquisition liabilities are evaluated
each reporting period using projected revenues, discount rates, and
projected timing of revenues. Projected contingent payment amounts
are discounted back to the current period using a discount rate.
Projected revenues are based on the Company s most recent
internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans. In
some cases, there is no maximum amount of contingent consideration
that can be earned by the sellers. Increases in projected revenues
will result in higher fair value measurements. Increases in
discount rates and the time to payment will result in lower fair
value measurements. Increases or decreases in any of those inputs
in isolation may result in a significantly lower or higher fair
value measurement. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 the net adjustment to the fair value of the contingent
acquisition debt was a decrease of approximately $315,000 and
approximately $1,185,000, respectively. During the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015 the net adjustment to the fair
value of the contingent acquisition debt was an increase of
approximately $120,000.

Stock Options 

On May 16, 2012, the Company established the 2012 Stock Option Plan
( Plan ) authorizing the granting of options for up to
40,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The purpose of the Plan is to
promote the long-term growth and profitability of the Company by
(i) providing key people and consultants with incentives to improve
stockholder value and to contribute to the growth and financial
success of the Company and (ii) enabling the Company to attract,
retain and reward the best available persons for positions of
substantial responsibility. The Plan permits the granting of stock
options, including non-qualified stock options and incentive stock
options qualifying under Section 422 of the Code, in any
combination (collectively,  Options ). At September 30,
2016, the Company had 17,046,975 shares of Common Stock available
for issuance under the Plan.  

A summary of the Plan Options for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 is presented in the following table:  

The weighted-average fair value per share of the granted options
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
approximately $0.09 and $0.15, respectively. 

Stock based compensation expense included in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations was $166,000 and $161,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and $292,000 and $436,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $487,000 of total
unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based
compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. The expense is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.79
years. 

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
( Black-Scholes model ) to estimate the fair value of
stock option grants. The use of a valuation model requires the
Company to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model
inputs. Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical
volatility of the Company s stock price over
the expected term of the option. The expected life is based on
the contractual life of the option and expected employee
exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The
risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon
issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at
the date of the grant.

Overview 

We operate in two segments: the direct selling segment where
products are offered through a global distribution network of
preferred customers and distributors and the commercial coffee
segment where products are sold directly to businesses. During the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we derived
approximately 89% of our revenue from direct sales and
approximately 11% of our revenue from our commercial coffee
sales. 

In the direct selling segment we sell health and wellness products
on a global basis and offer a wide range of products through an
international direct selling network of independent distributors.
Our multiple independent selling forces sell a variety of products
through friend-to-friend marketing and social
networking.   

We
also engage in the commercial sale of coffee.  We own CLR
Roasters a traditional coffee roasting business that sells roasted
and unroasted coffee and produces coffee under its own Cafe La Rica
brand, Josie s Java House brand and Javalution brands. CLR
produces coffee under a variety of private labels through major
national sales outlets and major customers, including cruise lines
and office coffee service operators. During fiscal 2014, CLR
acquired the Siles Plantation Family Group, a coffee plantation and
dry-processing facility located in Matagalpa, Nicaragua, an ideal
coffee growing region that is historically known for high quality
coffee production. The dry-processing facility is approximately 26
acres and the plantation is roughly 450 acres and produces 100
percent Arabica coffee beans that are shade grown, Rainforest
Alliance Certified(TM) and Fair Trade Certified(TM). The
plantation, dry-processing facility and existing U.S. based coffee
roaster facilities allows CLR to control the coffee production
process from field to cup.  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we derived
approximately 91% of our revenues from sales within the United
States.

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to three months
ended September 30, 2015 

Revenues 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our total revenue
increased 5.4% to $43,562,000 as compared to $41,326,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015.  During the three
months ended September 30, 2016, we derived approximately 89% of
our revenue from our direct selling segment sales and approximately
11% of our revenue from our commercial coffee segment
sales. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, direct
selling segment revenues increased by $1,520,000 or 4.1% to
$38,576,000 as compared to the three months ended September 30,
2015. This increase was primarily attributed to the additional
revenues derived from the Company s 2016 acquisitions. For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, commercial coffee
segment revenues increased by $716,000 or 16.8% to $4,986,000 as
compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This
increase was primarily attributed to an increase in green coffee
sales as a result of increases in green coffee prices and an
increase in roasted coffee sales. The following table summarizes
our revenue in thousands by segment:  

Cost of Revenues 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, overall cost of revenues
increased approximately 5.5% to $17,194,000 as compared to
$16,293,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
direct selling segment cost of revenues increased 5.8% as a result
of cost related to the increase in sales, an increase in product
royalties and labor costs. The cost of revenues of the commercial
coffee segment increased 4.7% is primarily attributable to increase
in sales, offset by lower green coffee costs a result of the
Company s ability to procure green coffee at lower costs from
its plantation and other suppliers in
Nicaragua.  

Cost of revenues includes the cost of inventory including green
coffee, shipping and handling costs incurred in connection with
shipments to customers, direct labor and benefits costs, royalties
associated with certain products, transaction merchant fees and
depreciation on certain assets. 

Gross Profit 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, gross profit increased
approximately 5.3% to $26,368,000 as compared to $25,033,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit in the
direct selling segment increased by 3.3% to $26,233,000 from
$25,395,000 in the prior year as a result of the increase in costs
discussed above. Gross profit (loss) in the commercial coffee
segment increased to $135,000, compared to a loss of $362,000 in
the prior year. The improvement in gross margin percentage in the
commercial coffee segment was primarily due to improved margins in
green coffee business as a result of more favorable pricing
structure, the ability to procure coffee at lower costs from the
Company s plantation and other suppliers in Nicaragua and a
strategic initiative to focus more on marketing CLR Roasters
company-owned brands which yield higher gross margins. Overall
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to 60.5%,
compared to 60.6% in the prior year. Below is a table of gross
profit percentages by segment:   

-24- 

Operating Expenses 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our operating
expenses increased approximately 7.6% to $25,792,000 as compared to
$23,976,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Included
in operating expense is distributor compensation paid to our
independent distributors in the direct selling segment. For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, distributor compensation
increased 4.1% to $18,101,000 from $17,387,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable
to the increase in revenues. Distributor compensation as a
percentage of direct selling revenues was 46.9% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the sales and
marketing expense increased 34.0% to $3,181,000 from $2,374,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to expenses
related to the distributor annual convention held in the current
quarter and increases in marketing related wages and expenses and
customer service labor costs. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the general and
administrative expense increased 7.0% to $4,510,000 from $4,215,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to
increases in costs related to the international expansion, employee
compensation and labor costs, amortization costs, computer related
costs, travel costs, offset primarily by a decrease in non-cash
expense of $253,000 as compared to the same period last year
related to warrant modification expense recognized during the three
months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, the contingent
liability revaluation resulted in a benefit of $315,000 in the
current quarter compared to an expense of $120,000 in the same
period last year.  

Operating Income 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, operating income
decreased approximately 45.5% to $576,000 as compared to $1,057,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This was primarily
due to the increase in sales and marketing costs discussed
above. Operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased
to 1.3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
2.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Total Other Expense 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, total other expense
increased by $545,000 to $577,000 as compared to $32,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the change
in fair value of the warrant derivative liability benefit from
$1,069,000 in 2015 to $369,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2016. Net interest expense decreased by $155,000 to $946,000 as
compared to $1,101,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015. 

Non-cash interest expense decreased by approximately
$71,000 when comparing to the current period as a result
of the fact that our January 2015 Private Placement related
issuance costs are fully amortized as compared to same period last
year. Non-cash interest expense includes the accretion of debt
discount and amortization of deferred financing costs related to
the Company s Private Placement transactions. Other decreases
in interest expense of approximately $68,000 were primarily
attributable to reduction in contingent acquisition debt interest,
offset by payments to investors associated with our Private
Placement Notes and other operating leases and notes
interest. 

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Derivative
Liability  . Various factors are
considered in the pricing models we use to value the warrants,
including our current stock price, the remaining life of the
warrants, the volatility of our stock price, and the risk free
interest rate. Future changes in these factors may have a
significant impact on the computed fair value of the warrant
liability. As such, we expect future changes in the fair value of
the warrants to continue and may vary significantly from year to
year (see Note 7, to the condensed consolidated financial
statements.)  

-25- 

Income Taxes  

Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the effective date of the change.
Realization of our deferred tax asset is dependent upon future
earnings in specific tax jurisdictions. It is determined that it is
more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized
in the US Federal tax jurisdiction. A valuation allowance remains
on the state and foreign tax attributes that are likely to expire
before realization. We have recognized income tax benefit of
$68,000 which is the change in our estimated federal, state and
foreign income tax liability for the three months ended September
30, 2016. The difference between the current effective rate and the
Federal statutory rate of 35.0% is primarily due to undistributed
foreign earnings and expenses that are not deductible for tax
purposes, such as amortization of debt discount, stock based
compensation, interest expense on warrants, change in valuation
allowance and meals and entertainment expense.  

Net Income 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported net
income of $67,000 as compared to net income of $416,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The primary reason for the
decrease in net income when compared to prior year was due to the
decrease in operating income, the change in fair value of warrant
derivative benefit of $369,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to a benefit of $1,069,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, offset by a tax benefit of $68,000
compared to a tax expense of $609,000 in the prior
year.  

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended
September 30, 2015 

Revenues 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues increased 6.3%
to $124,264,000 as compared to $116,876,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we derived approximately 89% of our revenue
from our direct selling segment sales and approximately 11% of our
revenue from our commercial coffee segment sales. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, direct selling revenues increased
by $7,187,000 or 7.0% to $110,393,000 as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily
attributed to the increase in our product offerings, the increase
in the number of distributors selling our product, price increases
on certain products and the increase in the number of customers
consuming our products as well as $4,142,000 in additional revenues
derived from the Company s 2016 acquisitions compared to the
prior period. The commercial coffee segment revenue increased by
1.5% to $13,871,000, primarily due to an increase in green coffee
sales as a result of a new contract that started shipping in
2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. Our coffee roaster
business revenue decreased as a result of a strategic shift in the
segment s business model to focus more effort on CLR Roasters
company-owned brands and forego its lower margin bulk coffee
processing business. The following table summarizes our revenue in
thousands by segment:  

-26- 

Cost of Revenues 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, overall cost of revenues increased
approximately 2.8% to $49,102,000 as compared to $47,752,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cost of
revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in the costs of
the direct selling segment of 7.1% as a result of costs
related to the increase in revenue.     This
is offset by a decrease in cost of revenue in the commercial coffee
segment of 7.1% primarily due to the ability to procure green
coffee at lower costs as a result of the Company s expansion
in Nicaragua.   

Gross Profit 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, gross profit
increased approximately 8.7% to $75,162,000 as compared to
$69,124,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Gross
profit in the direct selling segment increased by 6.9% to
$74,690,000 from $69,872,000 in the prior year. Gross profit
in the commercial coffee segment increased to $472,000 compared to
a loss of $748,000 in the prior year, an increase of $1,220,000.
Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 60.5%,
compared to 59.1% in the prior year. Below is a table of the gross
profit percentages by segment: 

Gross
profit as a percentage of revenues in the direct selling segment
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 did not change from
67.7% when compared with the same period last year. The improvement
in gross margin percentage in the commercial coffee segment was
primarily due to improved margins in green coffee business as a
result of more favorable pricing structure on new contracts, the
ability to procure coffee at lower costs from the Company s
plantation and other suppliers in Nicaragua and a strategic
initiative to focus more on marketing CLR Roasters company-owned
brands which yield higher gross margins.  

Operating Expenses 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our operating
expenses increased approximately 9.9% to $71,899,000 as compared to
$65,404,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Included
in operating expense is distributor compensation paid to our
independent distributors in the direct selling segment. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, distributor compensation
increased 7.6% to $50,871,000 from $47,261,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable
to the increase in revenues and increased distributor incentives.
Distributor compensation as a percentage of direct selling revenues
increased to 46.1% as compared to 45.8% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the sales and
marketing expense increased 25.2% to $7,619,000 from $6,087,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to an
increase in convention and distributor event costs, as well as
marketing and customer service labor costs. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the general and
administrative expense increased 11.2% to $13,409,000 from
$12,056,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily
due to increases in consulting costs related to international
expansion, travel expenses, website maintenance costs, insurance,
bank fees and employee compensation costs, offset primarily by a
decrease in non-cash expense of $253,000 as compared to the same
period last year related to warrant modification expense recognized
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition,
the contingent liability revaluation resulted in a benefit of
$1,185,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to an expense of $120,000 in the same period last
year. 

-27- 

Operating Income 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, operating income
decreased approximately 12.3% to $3,263,000 as compared to
$3,720,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was
primarily due to the increase in operating expenses discussed
above. Operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased to
2.6%, compared to 3.2% for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. 

Total Other Expense 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total other expense
decreased by $1,908,000 to $2,604,000 as compared to $4,512,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to the
change in fair value of the warrant derivative liability from an
expense of $1,232,000 in 2015 to a gain of $535,000 in 2016.
Net interest expense decreased by $141,000 to $3,139,000 as
compared to $3,280,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. 

Non-cash interest expense decreased by approximately $190,000
compared to the current period as a result of the fact that
our January 2015 Private Placement related issuance costs are
fully amortized as compared to same period last year. Non-cash
interest expense includes the accretion of debt discount and
amortization of deferred financing costs related to the
Company s Private Placement transactions. The decrease in
non-cash interest is offset by net changes to interest expense of
approximately $66,000 which is primarily attributable to the
increases in interest payments to investors associated
with our Private Placement Notes, increases in other operating
leases and notes interest offset by decreases in contingent
acquisition debt interest. 

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Derivative
Liability  . Various factors are
considered in the pricing models we use to value the warrants,
including our current stock price, the remaining life of the
warrants, the volatility of our stock price, and the risk free
interest rate. Future changes in these factors may have a
significant impact on the computed fair value of the warrant
liability. As such, we expect future changes in the fair value of
the warrants to continue and may vary significantly from year to
year (see Note 7, to the condensed consolidated financial
statements.)  

Income Taxes  

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and
tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the effective date of the
change. Realization of our deferred tax asset is dependent upon
future earnings in specific tax jurisdictions. It is determined
that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be
realized in the US Federal tax jurisdiction. A valuation allowance
remains on the state and foreign tax attributes that are likely to
expire before realization. We have recognized income tax expense of
$550,000, which is our estimated federal, state and foreign income
tax liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The
difference between the current effective rate and the Federal
statutory rate of 35.0% is primarily due to undistributed foreign
earnings and expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes,
such as amortization of debt discount, stock based compensation,
interest expense on warrants, change in valuation allowance and
meals and entertainment expense. 

Net Income (Loss)  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported net
income of $109,000 as compared to a net loss of $361,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The primary reason for the
increase in net income when compared to prior year was due to
the change in fair value of the warrant derivative liability from
an expense of $1,232,000 in 2015 to a gain of $535,000 in
2016, offset by a decrease in operating income discussed above and
tax expense of $550,000 compared to a tax benefit of $431,000 in
the prior year.  

-28- 

Adjusted EBITDA 

EBITDA
(earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization) as adjusted to remove the effect of stock based
compensation expense and the change in the fair value of the
warrant derivative or  Adjusted EBITDA,  decreased 3.2%
to $6,420,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $6,629,000 in the same period for the prior
year.  

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with our
results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides
useful information about our period-over-period growth. Adjusted
EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides
additional information with respect to the performance of our
fundamental business activities and is also frequently used by
securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the
evaluation of comparable companies. We also rely on Adjusted EBITDA
as a primary measure to review and assess the operating performance
of our company and our management team. 

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate
adjusted EBITDA by taking net income, and adding back the expenses
related to interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization,
stock based compensation expense and the change in the fair value
of the warrant derivative, as each of those elements are calculated
in accordance with GAAP.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be
construed as a substitute for net income (loss) (as determined in
accordance with GAAP) for the purpose of analyzing our operating
performance or financial position, as Adjusted EBITDA is not
defined by GAAP. 

A reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA to net income
(loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
is included in the table below (in thousands): 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources of Liquidity   

At September 30, 2016 we had cash and cash equivalents of
approximately $2,012,000 as compared to cash and cash equivalents
of $3,875,000 as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash was
primarily due to inventory purchases, cash for payments of
financing activities and cash used for capital
expenditures.  

Cash Flows  

Cash provided by operating activities  . Net cash provided by operating activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,565,000
as compared to net cash used in operating activities of
$556,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net cash
provided by operating activities consisted of net income of
$109,000, net non-cash operating activity of $2,112,000 offset
by $656,000 in changes in operating assets and
liabilities.  

-29- 

Net non-cash operating expenses included $2,865,000 in depreciation
and amortization, $292,000 in stock based compensation expense,
$270,000 related to the amortization of deferred financing costs
associated with our Private Placements, $790,000 related to the
amortization of debt discounts, $96,000 amortization of warrant
issuance costs and $76,000 in other non-cash items, offset
by $535,000 related to the change in the fair value of warrant
derivative liability, $557,000 in expenses allocated in profit
sharing agreement and $1,185,000 related to the change in the fair
value of contingent acquisition debt. 

Changes in operating assets and liabilities were attributable to
decreases in working capital, primarily related to changes in
inventory of $1,925,000, changes in accounts receivable of
$1,411,000 of which $886,000 related to an increase in our
factoring receivable and an increase of $525,000 from trade related
receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $502,000,
and deferred revenues of $652,000. Increases in working capital
primarily related to changes in accounts payable of $293,000,
accrued distributor compensation of $401,000, accrued expenses and
other liabilities of $2,967,000 and $173,000 related to income tax
receivable. 

Cash used in investing activities.   Net cash used in investing activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,026,000, as compared to net
cash used in investing activities of $2,339,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Net cash used in investing activities
consisted of purchases of property and equipment, leasehold
improvements and cash expenditures related to business
acquisitions.     

Cash used in financing activities.   Net cash used in financing activities was
$2,228,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as
compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,992,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cash
provided by financing activities was primarily due to the net
proceeds related to the January 2015 Private Placement of
approximately $5,080,000 received during the prior year
period.  

Net cash used in financing activities consisted of $1,131,000 in
payments related to the CLR Roasters factoring agreement, $411,000
in payments to reduce notes payable, $708,000 in payments related
to contingent acquisition debt, and $36,000 in payments related to
the Company s share repurchase program offset by proceeds
from the exercise of stock options and warrants, net, of $39,000
and $19,000 in proceeds from capital lease financing net of
payments to reduce capital lease obligations. 

Future Liquidity Needs 

We
believe that current cash balances, future cash provided by
operations, and available amounts under our accounts receivable
factoring agreement will be sufficient to cover our operating and
capital needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the
next 12 months. Though our operations are currently meeting our
working capital requirements, during 2014 and 2015 we raised an
aggregate of $13,187,500 in cash from the sale of notes in three
private placement transactions. We invested the net offering
proceeds in our wholly owned subsidiary, CLR Roasters, to fund
working capital for its Nicaragua plantation and for the purchase
of green coffee to accelerate the growth in our green coffee
division.  

If we experience an adverse operating environment or unusual
capital expenditure requirements, additional financing may be
required. No assurance can be given, however, that additional
financing, if required, would be available on favorable terms. We
might also require or seek additional financing for the purpose of
expanding into new markets, growing our existing markets, or for
other reasons. Such financing may include the use of additional
debt or the sale of additional equity securities. Any financing
which involves the sale of equity securities or instruments that
are convertible into equity securities could result in immediate
and possibly significant dilution to our existing
shareholders. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC
rules. 

-30- 

Contractual Obligations 

There have been no material changes to out contractual obligations
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from those
described in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31,
2015, 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the unaudited financial statements and
revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Information with respect to our
critical accounting policies which we believe could have the most
significant effect on our reported results and require subjective
or complex judgments by management is contained in Item 7,
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

With the exception of those stated below, there have been no recent
accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the
recent accounting pronouncements described in the Annual Report
that are of material significance, or have potential material
significance, to us. 

In
August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
 FASB ) issued  Accounting
Standards Update (  ASU ) No.
2016-15,  Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and
Cash Payments , which clarifies how companies present and
classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement
of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
is currently assessing the impact of this guidance. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Simplifying the Transition to
the Equity Method of Accounting   ( ASU 2016-07 ). ASU 2016-07
eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for
use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of
ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust
the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings
retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had
been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had
been held. ASU 2016-07 requires that the equity method investor add
the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to
the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and
adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment
becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon
qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive
adjustment of the investment is required. ASU 2016-17 requires that
an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that
becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize
through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated
other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes
qualified for use of the equity method. ASU 2016-07 is effective
for the Company s financial statements for annual and interim
periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and must be
applied prospectively.  The Company is currently assessing
the impact of this guidance. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-09,    Compensation - Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting    ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09
simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is
effective for us beginning January 1, 2017. Early adoption is
permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of
this guidance.   

-31- 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, 
 Leases (Topic
842).   The amendments in this
ASU change the existing accounting standards for lease accounting,
including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their
balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting.
The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2018. The new leases standard requires a
modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing
at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an
option to use certain transition relief.  The Company is
currently assessing the impact of this guidance. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which
requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it
expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing
revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes
effective. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of
the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard. The new
standard will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2018
and the Company has the option to adopt it effective January 1,
2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or
cumulative effect transition method. In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus
Net) ( ASU 2016-08 ), which clarifies the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in
the new revenue recognition standard. ASU 2016-08 clarifies how an
entity should identify the unit of accounting (i.e., the specified
good or service) for the principal versus agent evaluation and how
it should apply the control principle to certain types of
arrangements. In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ( ASU
2016-10 ), which amends certain aspects of the guidance on
identifying performance obligations and the implementation guidance
on licensing. The Company is evaluating the effect the ASUs will
have on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.  The Company is currently assessing the impact
of this guidance. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of
Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt
Issuance Costs   to simplify the
presentation of debt issuance costs. The amendments in the update
require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt
liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction
of the carrying amount of     the debt. Recognition and measurement of debt
issuance costs were not affected     by this amendment. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU
2015-15,  Presentation and     Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs
Associated With Line-of-Credit Arrangements-Amendments to SEC
Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at     June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting  which clarified
that the SEC would not object to an     entity deferring and presenting debt issuance
costs as an asset and subsequently     amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs
ratably over the term of the     line-of-credit arrangement.   ASU 2015-03 represents
a change in accounting principle and was effective on January 1,
2016 and was applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU
2015-03 resulted in a retrospective reclassification of our debt
issuance costs as described above from prepaid expenses and other
assets to convertible notes payable, net of debt discount on our
December 31, 2015 balance sheet in the amount of
$1,456,000.  

ITEM 3.  Q uantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the
Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are
electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are
not required to provide the information requested by this
Item. 

ITEM 4.  C ontrols and
Procedures 

(a)     

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of
September 30, 2016, the end of the quarterly fiscal period covered
by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of
September 30, 2016, such disclosure controls and procedures were
effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by
us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

(b)     

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting that occurred during our third quarter of fiscal year
2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal controls over financial
reporting.

P ART II. OTHER
INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.  L EGAL
PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings,
claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
The Company defends itself vigorously against any such claims.
Although the outcome of these matters is currently not
determinable, management expects that any losses that are probable
or reasonably possible of being incurred as a result of these
matters, which are in excess of amounts already accrued in its
condensed consolidated balance sheets would not be material to the
financial statements as a whole. 

On March 23, 2016, we filed a lawsuit against Wakaya Perfection,
LLC and several of its executives, including our former president
William Andreoli, or agents in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of California. The lawsuit is
captioned   Youngevity International Corp.
v. Todd Smith, et al.  , No.
16-cv-0704-W-JLB (S.D. Cal. 2016).  

The lawsuit alleges, inter alia, that executives and investors in
Wakaya Perfection unlawfully breached their contractual agreements
with Youngevity, including non-compete clauses, and intentionally
interfered with our existing distributor relationships through
unlawful conduct.  The defendants include individuals who
held positions within Youngevity, but departed to begin a competing
direct networking business. Our lawsuit seeks damages and
injunctive relief restraining the defendants from misappropriating
proprietary Youngevity information.
