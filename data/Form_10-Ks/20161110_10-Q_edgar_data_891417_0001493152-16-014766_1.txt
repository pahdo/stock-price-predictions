NOTE
1    ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

Organization    

PEN
Inc. ( we ,  us ,  our ,  PEN  or the  Company ), a Delaware company,
develops and sells a portfolio of nano-layer coatings, nano-based cleaners, and nano-composite products based on its proprietary
technology and performs nanotechnology research and development focused on generating revenues through performing research services.  

Through
our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nanofilm, Ltd., we develop, manufacture and sell products based on technology which permits the fabrication
of oriented, ultra-thin films of organic or polymeric crystals, and also produces a line of personal lens cleaners and accessories.
These products are marketed internationally primarily to customers in the eyeglass industry.  

Through
our wholly-owned subsidiary, Applied Nanotech, Inc., we primarily conduct research and development services for governmental and
private customers.  

Basis
of Presentation    

The
Company s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Applied Nanotech,
Inc., PEN Technology LLC, and Nanofilm, Ltd. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

The
consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared by us without
audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and
for the periods then ended, have been made. Those adjustments consist of normal and recurring adjustments.  

Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. The unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and footnotes thereto included
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  

The
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be expected for the full year.  

Going
concern    

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the consolidated financial statements
filed with our Form 10-K on March 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $1,869,247 and $2,370,254 for the years ended December
31, 2014 and 2015. The Company also had a net loss of $456,528 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Moreover, the Company
had an accumulated deficit, a stockholders  deficit and a working capital deficit of $5,800,694, $529,007 and $1,054,842,
respectively, at September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. Management cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash
flow positive, or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. During 2015 and continuing in the first three quarters of 2016,
management has taken measures to reduce operating expenses.

Although
the Company has historically raised capital from sales of equity and from the issuance of promissory notes, there is no assurance
that it will be able to continue to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending,
management expects that the Company will need to curtail its operations. These unaudited consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Use
of estimates    

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable, the estimates
for obsolete inventory, the useful life of property and equipment, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets,
estimates of current and deferred income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, the fair value of non-cash equity transactions,
and the fair value of equity incentives.  

Fair
value of financial instruments and fair value measurements    

The
Company adopted the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies
the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify
the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level
1- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.  

Level
2- Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets
and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or
corroborated by observable market data.  

Level
3- Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.  

The
carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, loans and lines
of credit, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other payables approximate their fair market value based on the short-term
maturity of these instruments.  

The
Company analyzes all financial and non-financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under the FASB s
accounting standard for such instruments. Under this standard, financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are classified
in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company accounts for
two instruments at fair value using level 3 valuation.

   (UNAUDITED)   

A
roll forward of the level 3 valuation of these three financial instruments is as follows:  

ASC
825-10  Financial Instruments , allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities
at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable,
unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that
instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value
option to any outstanding instruments.  

Cash
and cash equivalents    

For
purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of
three months or less at the purchase date and money market accounts to be cash equivalents.  

Accounts
receivable    

The
Company recognizes an allowance for losses on accounts receivable in an amount equal to the estimated probable losses net of recoveries.
The allowance is based on an analysis of historical bad debt experience, current receivables aging, and expected future write-offs,
as well as an assessment of specific identifiable customer accounts considered at risk or uncollectible. The expense associated
with the allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized as general and administrative expense.  

Inventory    

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. At September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, inventory consisted of the following:  

Property
and equipment    

Property
and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range
from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life or lease term including scheduled
renewal terms. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of
disposition. The Company examines the possibility of decreases in the value of these assets when events or changes in circumstances
reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable.

Impairment
of long-lived assets    

In
accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an
impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount
of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its book value. The Company did
not record any impairment charge for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Revenue
recognition    

Pursuant
to the guidance of ASC Topic 605, the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred or services have been provided, the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.  

Types
of Revenue:  

Net
    product sales by our subsidiary Nanofilm.   

Reimbursements
    under agreements to perform research and development for government agencies and others by our subsidiary, Applied Nanotech.
    We do not perform research contracts that are contingent upon successful results. Larger projects are sometimes broken down
    in phases to allow the customer to determine at the end of each phase if they wish to move to the next phase. The agreements
    with federal government agencies generally provide that, upon completion of a technology development program, the funding
    agency is granted a royalty-free license to use any technology developed by the program for its own purposes, but not any
    preexisting technology that we use in connection with the program. We retain all other rights to use, develop, and commercialize
    the technology. Agreements with nongovernmental entities generally allow the entity the first opportunity to license the technology
    from us upon completion of the project.   

Product
    sales and other miscellaneous revenues from our subsidiary, Applied Nanotech such as the sale of conductive inks and thermal
    management materials.   

Revenue
Recognition Criteria:  

Net
    product sales by our subsidiary Nano, are recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and title is transferred.   

Revenue
    from research and development government contracts is recognized when it is earned pursuant to the terms of the contract.
    These projects are usually billed monthly based on costs, hours, or some other measure of activity during the month and revenue
    is recognized as services are provided. If there is substantive acceptance terms then revenue will not be recognized until
    acceptance occurs. The recognition of revenue may not correspond with the billings allowable under the contract. To the extent
    that billings exceed revenue earned, a portion of the revenue is deferred until such time as it is earned.   

Revenue
    from research and development non-governmental contracts is recognized when it is earned pursuant to the terms of the contract.
    Each contract is unique and tailored to the needs of the customer and goals of the project. Some contracts may call for a
    monthly payment for a fixed period of time. Other contracts may be for a fixed dollar amount with an unspecified time period,
    although there is frequently a targeted completion date. These contracts generally involve some sort of up-front payment.
    Some contracts may call for the delivery of samples, or may call for the transfer of equipment or other items developed during
    the project to the customer. These projects are usually billed monthly based on costs, hours, or some other measure of activity
    during the month and revenue is recognized as services are provided. If there are substantive acceptance terms then revenue
    will not be recognized until acceptance occurs.   

Revenue
    from other product sales is recognized at the time the product shipped. The primary business of the Company s subsidiary,
    Applied Nanotech, is research and development, not the sale of products. Product sales are not significant in number, and
    are generally limited to the sale of conductive inks, thermal management materials, graphene foil, samples, proofs of concepts,
    prototypes, or other items resulting from its research.   

Other
    miscellaneous revenue is recognized as deemed appropriate given the facts of the situation and is generally not material.

Sales
incentives and consideration paid to customers    

The
Company accounts for certain promotional costs such as sales incentives and cooperative advertising as a reduction of sales. For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded
approximately $40,471 and $32,747 and $106,262 and $114,440, respectively, as a reduction of sales related to these costs.  

Cost
of sales    

Cost
of sales includes inventory costs, materials and supplies costs, internal labor and related benefits, subcontractor costs, depreciation,
overhead and shipping and handling costs incurred.  

Shipping
and handling costs    

Shipping
and handling costs incurred relating to the purchase of inventory are included in inventory which is charged to cost of sales
as product are sold. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in sales. For the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, shipping and handling costs incurred for product
shipped to customers are included in cost of sales and amounted to $46,255 and $44,980, and $140,059 and $147,002, respectively.  

Research
and development    

Research
and development costs incurred in the development of the Company s products and under other Company sponsored research and
development projects are expensed as incurred. Costs such as direct labor, direct costs, and other allocated costs incurred to
perform research and development service pursuant to government and private research projects are included in cost of sales. For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, research and development
costs incurred in the development of the Company s products were $71,921 and $174,736, and $236,534 and $620,291, respectively,
and are included in operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  

Advertising
costs    

The
Company participates in various advertising programs. All costs related to advertising of the Company s products are expensed
in the period incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, advertising costs charged to operations were $5,193 and $46,522, and $23,624 and $81,290, respectively and are included
in selling and marketing expenses on the consolidated accompanying statements of operations. These advertising expenses do not
include cooperative advertising and sales incentives which have been deducted from sales.

Federal
and state income taxes    

The
Company accounts for income tax using the liability method prescribed by ASC 740,   Income Taxes  . Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence,
it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred
taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.  

The
Company follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) 740   Income Taxes  . Using that guidance, tax positions initially need to be recognized in the financial
statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no uncertain tax positions that qualify for either recognition or disclosure in
the financial statements. Tax years that remain subject to examination are the years ending on and after December 31, 2013. The
Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in other expense. However, no such interest
and penalties were recorded as of September 30, 2016.  

Stock-based
compensation    

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition
in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting
period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the
 measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the measurement date is
reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based
on the fair value of the award at the reporting date.

Net

ASC
260  Earnings Per Share , requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) with
a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted
EPS computation. Basic EPS excludes dilution. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that
then shared in the earnings of the entity. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
net income per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 37,778 contingently
issuable common shares that are issuable based on certain market conditions (see Note 6) and are potentially dilutive are excluded
from the calculation of diluted EPS since they are anti-dilutive. Additionally, potentially dilutive common shares consist of
common stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method). These common stock equivalents may be dilutive in the future .
 Potentially dilutive common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding as they would have an
anti-dilutive impact on the Company s net losses and consisted of the following:  

Additionally,
there are an unknown quantity of common stock equivalents that result from a potential conversion of equity credits and stock
appreciation rights (See Notes 8, 9 and 11).

Segment
reporting    

The
Company uses  the management approach  in determining reportable operating segments. The management approach considers
the internal organization and reporting used by the Company s chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions
and assessing performance as the source for determining the Company s reportable segments. The Company s chief operating
decision maker is the Chairman and chief executive officer ( CEO ) of the Company, who reviews operating results to
make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company classified the reportable
operating segments into (i) the development, manufacture and sale of personal lens cleaners and accessories and ultra-thin films
of organic or polymeric crystals (the  Product Segment ) and (ii) the performance of research and development services
for government and private entities and any related sales of related products.  

Recent
accounting pronouncements    

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern,  that will require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related
footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. In connection with each annual and interim period, management will assess if there
is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date. Substantial
doubt exists if it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations within one year after the issuance date.
The new standard defines substantial doubt and provides example indicators. Disclosures will be required if conditions give rise
to substantial doubt. However, management will need to assess if its plans will alleviate substantial doubt to determine the specific
disclosures. This standard is effective for public entities for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier application
of this standard is permitted. This standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ),
which requires entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
The ASU simplifies the current guidance in ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes , which requires entities to separately present deferred
tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities
as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not expect the impact of ASU 2015-17 to be material
to its consolidated financial statements.  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , which requires an entity to measure
most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must
measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The accounting standard is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual
reporting period. The Company does not expect this accounting standard to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

On
January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 to amend the accounting guidance on the classification and measurement of financial
instruments. The standard requires that all investments in equity securities, including other ownership interests, are carried
at fair value through net income. This requirement does not apply to investments that qualify for equity method accounting or
to those that result in consolidation of the investee or for which the entity has elected the predictability exception to fair
value measurement. Additionally, the standard requires that the portion of the total fair value change caused by a change in instrument-specific
credit risk for financial liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected would be recognized in other comprehensive
income. Any accumulated amount remaining in other comprehensive income is reclassified to earnings when the liability is extinguished.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not anticipate
the guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or notes to its consolidated financial statements.  

On
February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ) to amend the accounting guidance for leases. The
accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged under ASU 2016-02. However, the standard requires lessees to recognize lease
assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases on the balance sheet. Lessees will recognize in the statement
of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election
by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it will recognize
lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance
on its consolidated financial statements and notes to its consolidated financial statements.  

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ) to amend the accounting guidance for share-based payment
accounting. The areas for simplification in ASU 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement
of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing
the impact of the guidance on its consolidated financial statements and notes to its consolidated financial statements.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ). The amendments in this update clarify the following two aspects to Topic 606:
identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those
areas. The entity first identifies the promised goods or services in the contract and reduce the cost and complexity. An entity
evaluates whether promised goods and services are distinct. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on determining whether
an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property
(which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over
time). ASU 2016-10 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early application
is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-10 and its impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.  

There
are no other recently issued accounting standards that apply to us or that are expected to have a material impact on our results
of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.  

Reclassifications    

Certain
prior period amounts in the consolidated statement of operations have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform to
the fiscal 2016 presentation. These reclassifications have no impact on the previously reported net loss.

NOTE
3 -  BANK LOANS AND LINES OF REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY    

In
April 2014, our subsidiary, Nanofilm entered into a $1,500,000 revolving credit line agreement (the  Revolving Note )
with Mackinac Commercial Credit, LLC (the  Lender ). The unpaid principal balance of this Revolving Note is payable
on demand, is secured by all of Nanofilm s assets, and bears interest computed at a rate of interest (the  Effective
Rate ) which is equal to 7.0% above the LIBOR Rate, as defined, payable monthly. Nanofilm will pay to Lender a late charge
of 5.0% of any monthly payment not received by Lender within 10 calendar days after its due date. The Company may, at any time
or from time to time upon three business days  written notice to Lender, prepay the Note in whole provided that if (i) Borrower
prepays the Revolving Note in full and terminates the Revolving Note, or (ii) Lender terminates the Revolving Note after default,
then Borrower will pay a termination premium equal to 2.0% of the maximum loan amount. On May 1, 2015, Nanofilm and the Lender
entered into an amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement extending the outside maturity date to April 4, 2016 and permitting
advances against an expanded borrowing base. The borrowing base was increased by $450,000 through October 31, 2015, with this
amount reducing by $7,500 monthly thereafter. In addition, the Company guaranteed Nanofilm s obligations to the Lender.
On April 4, 2016, the maturity date under the Loan   Security Agreement between Nanofilm and the Lender was automatically
extended for a one-year renewal term.  

Without
the Lender s consent, so long as the obligation remains outstanding, in addition to other covenants as defined in the Revolving
Note, Nanofilm shall not a) merge or consolidate with any other company, and shall not suffer a change of control; b) make any
capital expenditures, as defined, materially affecting the business; c) declare or pay cash dividends upon any of its stock, or
distribute any of its property, make any loans, make investments, redeem, retire or acquire any of its stock, d) become liable
for the indebtedness of anyone else, as defined, and e) incur indebtedness, other than trade payables.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had $958,797 in borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Note with $541,203 available for borrowing
under such note. The weighted average interest rate during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 8.3% and for the nine
months then ended was approximately 8.1%.  

NOTE
4    NOTES PAYABLE    

On
February 10, 2015, Nanofilm entered into a promissory note (the  Equipment Note ) with KeyBank, N.A. (the  Bank )
to borrow up to $373,000. Nanofilm may obtain one or more advances not to exceed $373,000. The unpaid principal balance of this
Equipment Note is payable in 60 equal monthly installments payments of principal and interest through June 10, 2020. The Equipment
Note is secured by certain equipment, as defined in the Equipment Note, and bears interest computed at a rate of interest of 4.35%
per annum based on a year of 360 days. At September 30, 2016, the principal amount due under the Equipment Note amounted to $278,927.  

In
June and November 2015, in connection with a severance package offered to four employees, the Company entered into three promissory
note agreements with those individuals that obligate the Company to pay them accrued and unpaid deferred salary in an aggregate
amount of $51,807. The principal bears interest at the minimum rate of interest applicable under the internal revenue code (approximately
1.41% at September 30, 2016). All principal and interest payable under three of these notes aggregating $37,457 are due in 2025
and all principal and interest payable under one of these notes amounting to $14,350 is due in 2020.  

On
May 31, 2016, in connection with a restatement of our agreement with a former research partner we delivered a promissory note
to repay amounts previously advanced to us and accrued. The initial principal amount was $51,239 bearing interest at 5% per annum.
Installment payments include both principal and interest. After an initial payment of $2,000, the note requires payments of $1,000
for eleven months, payments of $2,000 for the following 12 months and monthly payments of $3,000 thereafter until paid in full.
The principal balance due on September 30, 2016 was $46,845. In addition, we agreed that our share of certain patent costs would
be an offset against future royalties due to us, so we reversed accruals of $33,713, resulting in a net gain of $33,511, which
is included within other income, net on the consolidated statement of operations.

December 11, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of
the Company s common stock at the ratio of 1-for-180 (the  Reverse Stock Split ) and authorized an amendment
of the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect the Reverse Stock Split, to reduce
the number of authorized shares of common stock, and to set a par value of $0.0001 per share after the Reverse Stock Split. On
January 26, 2016, each one hundred eighty (180) shares of the Company s (i) Class A Common Stock ( Class A common
stock ), (iii) Class B Common Stock and (iii) Class Z Common Stock, then issued and outstanding were automatically combined
into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class Z Common
Stock, respectively, without any further action by the Company or the holder. Additionally, the authorized number of shares of
common stock were reduced to 10,000,000 comprised of 7,200,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, 2,500,000 shares of Class B Common
Stock ( Class B common stock ), and 300,000 shares of Class Z Common Stock ( Class Z common stock ). The
par value of each class of common stock remained the same at $0.0001 per common share. All share and per share data in the accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split
and authorized shares. The Company is also authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share

On
August 27, 2014, the Company entered into a Restricted Stock Agreement with Dr. Zvi Yaniv, the former Chief Operating Officer
and President, of Applied Nanotech, and a retired employee of the Company granting Dr. Yaniv 37,778 shares of Class A common stock,
subject to forfeiture. All these shares become vested and not subject to forfeiture on the earlier of a change of control of us,
Dr. Yaniv s death, or if more than 180 days after closing, the average trading price of the shares during a measurement
period of ten consecutive trading days reaches certain price thresholds. At an $18.00 price, 5,554 shares vest, with additional
tranches of 5,556 shares vesting if the price reaches $27.00, $36.00, $45.00 and $54.00. The last 10,000 shares vest at a $63.00
price threshold. Any shares that have not vested five years after the Effective Date will be forfeited. We also entered into a
Piggyback Registration Rights Agreement that will allow Dr. Yaniv, subject to other customary terms and conditions, to register
shares that are no longer subject to forfeiture if we are registering our shares. Pursuant to ASC 718-10 and related subsections,
these shares were valued on the date of grant of August 27, 2014 at $13.12 per share for a total value of $495,720. The Company
estimates the fair value of the awards with market conditions using a Binomial simulation, which utilizes several assumptions
including the risk-free interest rate, the volatility of the Company s stock and the exercise behavior of award recipients.
The grant-date fair value of $495,720 of the awards will be recognized over the requisite service period of 3 years, which represents
the derived service period for the stock grant as determined by the Binomial simulation method. For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, in connection with the amortization of the fair value of this stock grant, the Company recorded stock-based
compensation of $41,310 and $123,930, respectively.

purchase equity credits that increase in value based upon an increase in Nanofilm s revenue over a base year of 1996. Eligible
credits can be redeemed after two years at the higher of the purchase price or the equity credit value for that year. Under certain
circumstances, the equity credits are convertible into Nano equity on a one-for-one basis. The maximum number of credits available
for issuance is 385,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 5,000 credits were redeemed and no equity credits were
forfeited. As of September 30, 2016, 41,750 equity credits were issued and outstanding with an aggregate formula redemption value
of $12,551, and, as of December 31, 2015, 46,750 equity credits were issued and outstanding with an aggregate formula redemption
value of $14,154.  

Under
the terms of the Plan, when the Company completes a registered offering of its common stock, the equity credit participants will
have the option to convert the equity credits into Class A common shares of the Company, or in the case of our President, into
shares of Class B common stock.

NOTE
9    STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS PLAN    

From
June 1, 1988, until December 31, 1997, when the plan was terminated, Nanofilm had in place a Stock Appreciation Rights Plan A
(the  Plan ), intended to provide employees, directors, members of a technical advisory board and certain independent
contractors selected by the Board with equity-like participation in the growth of Nanofilm. The maximum number of stock appreciation
rights that could be granted by the Board was 1,000,000.  

There
were 235,782 fully vested stock appreciation rights ( SARS ) outstanding under the terms of the Plan at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The SARS unit value is based on the book value of the Company as of the last fiscal year end multiplied
by a SARS multiplier stipulated in the SARS plan. However, in the event of an initial public offering ( IPO ) of Nanofilm,
the SARS are redeemable based on a value equal to offering price of the stock in an IPO times the total outstanding shares of
the Company just subsequent to the completion of the IPO, multiplied by the SARS multiplier. The SARS multiplier is to be adjusted,
as the Board determines, to reflect changes in the capitalization of Nanofilm. Generally, the SARS are redeemable in cash, at
their then fair value as computed pursuant to the Plan, in the event of termination of employment or business relationship, death,
permanent and total disability, or sale of Nanofilm (as defined). Upon an IPO, SARS are to be redeemed by applying 70% of the
redemption value to purchase common shares, with the remaining 30% being distributed in cash to the participant. The business
combination that closed in August 2014 did not qualify as an IPO under the Plan; however, a future underwritten registered offering
may qualify.  

The
accrued redemption value associated with the stock appreciation rights amounted to $53,108 and $53,108, at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively. If the Company completes an IPO, the value of SARS calculated based on the IPO formula may
cause a material increase in the value of the liability.  

NOTE
10    SEGMENT REPORTING    

The
Company s principal operating segments coincide with the types of products to be sold. The products from which revenues
are derived are consistent with the reporting structure of the Company s internal organization. The Company s two
reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were i) the Product Segment and ii) the Research
and Development Segment. The Company s chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Chairman and CEO, who reviews
operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Segment information
is presented based upon the Company s management organization structure as of September 30, 2016 and the distinctive nature
of each segment. Future changes to this internal financial structure may result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed.
There are no inter-segment revenue transactions and, therefore, revenues are only to external customers. As the Company primarily
generates its revenues from customers in the United States, no geographical segments are presented.  

Segment
operating profit is determined based upon internal performance measures used by the chief operating decision-maker. The Company
derives the segment results from its internal management reporting system. The accounting policies the Company uses to derive
reportable segment results are the same as those used for external reporting purposes. Management measures the performance of
each reportable segment based upon several metrics, including net revenues, gross profit and operating income (loss). Management
uses these results to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the reportable segments. The Company manages
certain operating expenses separately at the corporate level and does not allocate such expenses to the segments. Segment income
from operations excludes interest income/expense and other income or expenses and income taxes according to how a particular reportable
segment s management is measured. Management does not consider impairment charges, and unallocated costs in measuring the
performance of the reportable segments.

ITEM
2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The
following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position
and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements.  

OVERVIEW   

PEN s
primary business is the marketing and sale of products enabled by nanotechnology. We develop and sell products based on our portfolio
of intellectual property. Our current products are a portfolio of nano-layer coatings, nano-based cleaners, printable inks and
pastes, and thermal management materials. Additionally, we conduct research and development services for governmental and private
customers.  

Our
principal operating segments coincide with our different business activities and types of products sold. This is consistent with
our internal reporting structure. Our two reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were (i)
the Product Segment and (ii) the Research and Development Segment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the
Company operated the same two segments.  

Product
segment   

Revenue
is based on the successful development of specialty products utilizing nanotechnology to deliver unique performance attributes
at the surfaces of a wide variety of substrates. Our products are sold in liquid form enabling application by a number of common
commercial techniques and in some instances, also as wet and dry towelettes. We rely on intellectual property and or trade secret
formulations to protect our proprietary technology.  

We
have three broad product technology platforms that offer solutions to some common problems such as ease of cleaning, preventing
fogging, preventing accumulation of dirt or grime, improving resistance to scuffing and wear. All our products have some  nano 
characteristic about them   whether it is being active at the molecular level, incorporation of submicron-particles, or
creating very thin, self-assembling coatings that are 20 nanometers or less in thickness.  

One
line of commercial products center on our customized optical and eyewear cleaning and de-fogging treatments. Another is a family
of coating liquids that create very thin, strongly-bound, clear coatings on surfaces used for glass and ceramic surfaces. The
third product family is series of clear coatings for plastics incorporating submicron size particles to improve abrasion resistance
and wear resistance without sacrificing transparency. Our goal continues to be to create segment leading brands through sales
of high quality consumer products, and to develop and produce customized formulas for sale to strategic, industrial partners to
be incorporated into their customer s products. We manufacture our formulations internally to protect our technology and
maintain the highest quality for the products that we and our commercial partners bring to the marketplace.  

Our
main products are:  

Liquid
    and towelette formulations packaged in many formats for retail sale to consumers for eyeglass and sunglass lens cleaning and
    protection.   

Anti-fogging
    liquid and towelette formulations packaged for retail sale to consumers for safety glasses, protective eye wear including
    face shields, and sporting goggles.   

Anti-fogging
    towelettes for sale to the military for safety, anti-fogging and conditioning of lenses, masks, head gear and other applications
    such as head s up displays,   

Mar
    resistant and stain resistant coatings for high end vitreous china tableware used for heavy duty, usage situations such as
    restaurants, cruise ships, casinos.   

Clear
    protective coatings used on display panels and touch screens to make it easy to remove fingerprints. Applications include
    automotive and hand held devices.   

Protective
    and water repelling coatings on interior glass   decorated glass panels, shower doors to make it easy to clean and prevent
    scale and grime encrustation.   

Coatings
    for ceramic insulators used in transit and underground subways systems to prevent caking of metal dust and greases on surfaces
    to reduce maintenance and current leakage losses.   

New
products under development include products targeted to our current customer base in the optical, transportation, military, sports,
and safety industries.  

Separate
from our historical business, we are also focused on creating products enabled by nanotechnology that tackle and solve big, global
problems in growing markets. We have three primary areas of new product focus:  

1.  
      Health:
    Treating or printing of surfaces at the nano-scale to promote health, fight the spread of disease, and assist in the arms
    race against super bugs;   

2.  
      Safety:
     Smelling  at the nano-scale level to identify hazardous condition, alert those in danger, and initiate steps
    to prevent catastrophe; and   

3.  
      Sustainability:
    Creating nano-scale devices and formulas using the minimal amounts of safe, natural ingredients and manufacturing methods,
    and avoiding using harsh chemicals and pesticides, whenever possible.   

The
first new product is the HALO surface protector. The patent-pending product is a spray cleaner that penetrates and fortifies the
surface. This fortifier and protector can clean and protect many surfaces, both natural and man-made. After application, the product
continues to fortify and protect, creating a healthy surface.  

Our
product is made with safe ingredients and does not use harsh chemicals or disinfectants. We start with a natural mineral that
is milled and engineered into a smaller shape and size. Then, the milled mineral is mixed with a proprietary cleaner solution
to create our product. The mineral chosen is stable in air and water. No governmental approvals are required for sale of this
product. The product:  

Rids
    surface of dust, dirt and debris;   

Leaves
    a healthy surface;   

Is
    safe to use;   

Will
    continue to work after application;   

Is
    fast acting;   

Is
    non-corrosive;   

Is
    easy to apply;   

Is
    non-flammable;   

Is
    friendly to the environment;    

Is
    odor-free; and   

Is
    stain-free.    

Research
and development segment   

We
are a global leader in nanotechnology research and development and this segment focuses on generating revenues through performing
research services. Our nanotechnology research is aimed at solving problems at the molecular level - working with the basic properties
of matter to create new and improved materials and technologies. We do both research and development, including proof of concepts
and prototypes, for our own products and research and development under contract for government and private entities. In our work
on products for ourselves we focus on using only the submicron size particles, not smaller nanoparticles that are subject to much
greater government regulation. Our work generally falls under one of three technology platforms:  

Nanosensor
    technology;   

Nanoelectronics;
    and   

Submicron
    particle formulations for health and safety products.   

Our
research and development efforts are currently focused in these and emerging areas.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

The
following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative consolidated financial statements,
footnotes and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated
financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. The results discussed below
are for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Comparison
of Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenues:    

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenues consisted of the following:  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, sales from the Product segment increased by $107,513 or 6%. For the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2016 sales decreased by $582,384 or 10%. The decline for the nine-month period is due primarily to several
institutional customers who bought significant inventory in the first nine-months of 2015 and did not purchase in the first nine
months of 2016. The revenues from the Research and development segment decreased by 111,467 or 33% for the three-month period
and declined $613,671 or 43% for the nine-month period. Research contracts expire at the end of a project, and, curtailed by our
decision to improve profitability and not to seek cost-share contracts, the Research development segment has not been successful
at winning new contracts to replace all those that expire.  

Cost
of revenues:    

Cost
of revenues includes inventory costs, materials and supplies costs, internal labor and related benefits, subcontractor costs,
depreciation, overhead and shipping and handling costs incurred including research and development costs related to government
and private research contracts in our Research and Development segment as summarized as follow:  

Gross
profit and gross margin:    

Gross
profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, increased $114,634
or 22.2%. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
decreased $292,877 or 12.0%.  

Gross
profit and gross margin by segment is shown below.  

* Gross
margin % based on respective segments revenues.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the decrease in gross margin percentage for the Product segment as compared to that
period in 2015 was due largely to product mix in optical products. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the decrease
in gross margin percentage from the Product segment as compared to the comparable 2015 period was also due to the product mix
in optical products as well as a drop off in sales of the anti-fog products.  

The
increase in gross margin percentage for the research development segment for the three month period was primarily attributable
to a decrease in cost of revenues. The decrease in gross margin percentage for the research development segment for the nine month
period was attributable to a decrease in revenues related to a decrease in the number of research projects being performed and
the allocation of fixed overhead and salaries to the reduced number of projects. The operating losses in this segment do not reflect
sublease income reflected in other income and expense that offset some of the facility costs incurred by this segment.  

Operating
expenses:    

Operating
expenses for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are shown below. For the three-month
period, operating expenses decreased $382,587 or 31%. For the nine months, operating expenses decreased $1,134,196 or 29%. For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, operating expenses consisted of the following:  

Loss
from operations:    

As
a result of the factors described above, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, loss from operations amounted to $(235,772)
as compared to $(732,993) for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an improvement of $497,221 or 68%, and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, loss from operations amounted to $(602,907) as compared to $(1,444,226) for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, an improvement of $841,319, or 58%.  

Other
income (expense) :   

Other
income (expense) includes interest expense and other income (expense). For the three months ended September 30, 2016, total other
income was $24,870 as compared to other expenses of $(24,117), an increase of $48,987. This variance was attributable primarily
to rent from the sublease of excess space at the R D center in Austin. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total
other income amounted to $146,379. as compared to other expense in the 2015 period of $(80,854). The sublease income in Austin,
and sales of equipment in Austin earlier in the year were the primary factors contributing to the change.  

Net
loss and net loss per share:    

As
a result of the foregoing, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, net loss amounted to $(210,902) and $(456,528)
as compared to net loss of $(757,110) and $(1,525,080) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, an improvement
of $546,208 or 72% for the three-month period and $1,068,552 or 70% for the nine months.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net loss per share amounted to $(0.07) per common share (basic and diluted),
and $(0.15) per common share (basic and diluted), respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net loss
per share amounted to $(0.25) per common share (basic and diluted), and $(0.51) per common share (basic and diluted), respectively.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

Liquidity
is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had a working
capital deficit of $(1,054,842) and $126,714 of cash as of September 30, 2016 and a working capital deficit of $(889,657) and
$262,519 of cash as of December 31, 2015.  

The
following table sets forth a summary of changes in our working capital from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016:  

Both
total current assets and total current liabilities decreased, but the decrease in total current assets was larger primarily because
of a decrease in accounts receivable primarily due to decreased sales.  

Net
cash flow provided by operating activities was $188,459 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash used
by operating activities of $(749,890) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an improvement of $938,349.  

We
expect our cash used in operating activities to increase for additional working capital to support increases in sales and for
increased advertising, commissions and sales promotions.  

Net
cash provided by investing activities was $17,866 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash used in
investing activities of $231,796 in the same period in 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash flow provided
by investing activities reflects the sale of property and equipment related to the subleasing of excess space at the R D center
in Austin resulting in proceeds of $21,866 that was reduced by the purchase of property and equipment of $4,000. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, net cash flow provided by investing activities reflects the purchase of property and equipment
of $231,796.  

Net
cash used by financing activities was $(342,130) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash provided
by financing activities of $707,052 in the same period in 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received proceeds
from our line of credit of $5,193,000 while repaying $5,522,951 on the line. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
we received proceeds from our line of credit of $6,209,500 while repaying $5,855,754 on the line.  

Although
we have historically raised capital from sales of equity and from the issuance of promissory notes, there is no assurance that
we will be able to continue to do so. If we are unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending, we expect that
we will need to curtail our operations.  

Our
unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern
and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values.
The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Our
principal future uses of cash are for working capital requirements, including sales and marketing expenses and other operating
activities, plus the reduction of liabilities. Application of funds among these uses will depend on numerous factors including
our sales and other revenues and our ability to control costs.  

Revolving
Credit Note    

In
April 2014, our subsidiary, Nanofilm entered into a $1,500,000 revolving credit line agreement (the  Revolving Note )
with Mackinac Commercial Credit, LLC (the  Lender ). The unpaid principal balance of this Revolving Note is payable
on demand, is secured by all Nanofilm s assets, and bears interest computed at a rate of interest (the  Effective
Rate ) which is equal to 7.0% above the LIBOR Rate, as defined, payable monthly. On April 4, 2016, the maturity date was
automatically extended for a one-year renewal term. So long as the Revolving Note remains outstanding, in addition to other covenants
as defined in the Revolving Note, Nanofilm must obtain the Lender s consent in order to do the following: a) merge or consolidate
with any other company, and shall not suffer a change of control; b) make any capital expenditures, as defined, materially affecting
the business; c) declare or pay cash dividends upon any of its stock, or distribute any of its property, make any loans, make
investments, redeem, retire or acquire any of its stock, d) become liable for the indebtedness of anyone else, as defined, and
e) incur indebtedness, other than trade payables.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had $958,797 in borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Note with $541,203 available for borrowing
under such note. The weighted average interest rate during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 8.3% and for the nine
months then ended was approximately 8.1%.  

Equipment
Financing    

On
February 10, 2015, Nanofilm entered into a $373,000 promissory note (the  Equipment Note ) with KeyBank, N.A. (the
 Bank ). The unpaid principal balance of this Equipment Note is payable in 60 equal monthly installments payments
of principal and interest of $7,211 through June 10, 2020. The Equipment Note is secured by certain equipment, as defined in the
Equipment Note, and bears interest computed at a rate of interest of 4.35% per annum based on a year of 360 days. At September
30, 2016, the principal amount due under the Equipment Note amounted to $278,927.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates    

There
are no material changes from the critical accounting policies set forth in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC
on March 30, 2016. Please refer to that document for disclosures regarding the critical accounting policies related to our business.

4. Controls and Procedures   

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by
this report (the  Evaluation Date ). Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the material
information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) reports is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to the Company, including, our consolidated
subsidiaries, and was made known to them by others within those entities, particularly during the period when this report was
being prepared.  

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.  

Changes
in Internal Control    

There
were no changes identified in connection with our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

On
July 25, 2016, in payment for service on our Board we issued 2,667 shares of Class A common stock and 1,778 shares of Class B
common stock to our Board members with an aggregate value of $10,000.  

On
July 25, 2016, we issued 17,793 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $2.81 per share to a private investor for a cash
purchase of $50,000 that was received in May, 2016 and reflected as a deposit on stock purchase liability at June 30, 2016. On
July 25, 2016, we also issued a 5-year warrant to purchase up to 712 shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $2.81
per share and we subsequently paid a fee of $2,000 to the investment banking firm that assisted us in the private placement that
resulted in the sale to the cash investor.  

Shares
issued to our Board and the warrant issued to the investment bank were exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) and 3(a)(9).
The cash investor is an accredited investor under Regulation D and the shares issued to that investor were exempt from registration

                                         regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
                                         for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

                                         the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented
                                         in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
                                         procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;

                                         that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially
                                         affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal
                                         control over financial reporting; and

                                         auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors:   

(a)    All
                                         significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
                                         control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                                         registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
                                         and                                                                 

(b)    Any
                                         fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
                                         a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
