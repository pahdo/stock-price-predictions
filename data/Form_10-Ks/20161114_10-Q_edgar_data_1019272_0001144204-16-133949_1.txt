1. The Company  

The condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Empire Resources Pacific Ltd., the Company s sales
agent in Australia, 8911 Kelso Drive, (organized in June 2015) the owner of the warehouse facility in Essex, Maryland, 6900 Quad
Avenue, LLC, the former owner of a warehouse facility in Baltimore, Maryland which was sold in 2015, Imbali Metals BVBA, Empire
Resources (UK) Ltd (organized in February 2015), and Empire Resources de Mexico, the Company s operating subsidiaries in
Europe and Mexico. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. The Company purchases and
sells semi-finished aluminum and steel products to a diverse customer base located in the Americas, Australia, Europe and New Zealand. 

2. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued new accounting guidance, Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers, on revenue recognition. The new standard provides for a single five-step model to be applied to
all revenue contracts with customers as well as requiring additional financial statement disclosures that will enable users to
understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. Companies have
an option to use either a retrospective approach or cumulative effect adjustment approach to implement the standard. For public
entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017, with
early adoption permitted for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016, the original
effective date of the statement. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The guidance requires debt issuance costs related
to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related
debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2015. ASU No. 2015-03 requires the new guidance to be applied on a retroactive basis. The Company adopted this guidance
in the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and resulted in the Company reclassifying long term unamortized financing costs of $369 and
$629 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively, from assets to be shown as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of the related debt liability. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ( ASU 2015-11 ) which changes the measurement
principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 defines net
realizable value as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion,
disposal, and transportation. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have
on its financial statements and related disclosures. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,
Income Taxes- Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments
in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial
position. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The amendments
in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods within those annual periods. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ) which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required
to recognize for all leases at the commencement date a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments
arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis, and a right-to-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s
right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect
that the new guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 

-  8  - 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ,  which requires all excess tax benefits or deficiencies to be recognized
as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. In addition, excess tax benefits should be classified along with other
income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. Application of the standard is required for the
annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Payments, which addresses the classification of certain specific cash receipts and
payments within the statement of cash flows, with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice of such classifications.
ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The guidance
is to be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company does not expect the adoption of
this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

3. Interim Financial Statements  

The condensed consolidated interim financial
statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
for interim reporting. The information and note disclosures normally included in complete financial statements prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to such rules and regulations. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The Company s management is responsible
for interim financial information. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
contain all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial
position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. Interim results may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year. 

4. Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

5. Concentrations  

During the nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015 one
customer, Ryerson Inc., accounted for 10.6% and 10.3% of sales respectively. 

The Company purchases metal products from a
limited number of suppliers throughout the world. Three suppliers, Hulamin Ltd, Southeast Aluminum and PT Alumindo Light Metal
Industry Tbk ( PT. Alumindo ) accounted for an aggregate of 54% of total purchases during the nine month period ended
September 30, 2016. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, two suppliers, PT Alumindo and Southeast Aluminium accounted
for an aggregate of 44% of total purchases. 

The loss of any one of the Company s
largest suppliers or a material default by any such supplier in its obligations to the Company could have a material adverse effect
on the Company s business. 

6. Stock Options  

Stock-based compensation for an award of equity
instruments, including stock options, is recognized as an expense over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award
at the grant date. As of September 30, 2016, there were outstanding employee stock options to acquire 50 shares of common stock,
which had vested in prior years. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not grant any stock options. 

-  9  - 

7. Treasury Stock  

On July 22, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized
the Company to repurchase up to 2,000 shares of its common stock. As of September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased a total of
1,821 shares under the repurchase program for an aggregate cost of $5,670. During the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company repurchased 109 and 330 common shares at a cost of $453 and $1,407, respectively. 

8. Inventories  

Inventories, which consist of purchased semi-finished
metal products, are stated at the lower of cost or market value.  Cost is determined by the specific-identification method.
Inventory is purchased for specific customer orders and the Company s own inventory.  The carrying amount of inventory
which is hedged by futures contracts designated as fair value hedges, is adjusted to fair value. 

9. Notes Payable Banks  

On June 19, 2014 the Company entered into an
amended and restated committed credit agreement with Rabobank International, for itself and as lead arranger and agent, BNP Paribas,
for itself and as syndication agent, and Soci t  G n rale, ABN AMRO, RB International, and Brown Brothers
Harriman as well as a new uncommitted line of credit with Rabobank International, BNP Paribas and Soci t  G n rale.
Both credit lines are secured, asset-based credit facilities. The committed credit facility provided for amounts up to $150,000,
and the uncommitted facility provided for a maximum amount of $75,000. The agreement also allowed for an additional increase in
the committed credit facility of $75,000, for a total of $300,000, subject to certain restrictions and conditions. On December
18, 2014, these lines were amended and increased the working capital credit agreement by $50,000 increasing the overall line of
credit to $275,000. The amended committed credit agreement was increased by $35,000 to $185,000, and the uncommitted credit facility
was increased by $15,000 to $90,000. On June 14, 2016 the Company amended the committed credit facility by reducing the facility
to $162,500. In addition, the Company also amended the uncommitted credit facility by reducing the facility to $50,000, and extending
the termination date to June 19, 2017. There are no changes to the interest rate or to the maturity date of the committed facility,
which remains June 19, 2017. Subsequent to these amendments the additional increase available under the term of the committed credit
facility is $40,000, subject to certain restrictions and conditions. Borrowings under this line of credit are secured by substantially
all of the Company s assets. During the first half of 2017, prior to the expiration of the credit agreements, the Company
expects to renew its credit agreements,  however there can be no assurances
that it will be able to successfully conclude new agreements.  

Amounts borrowed bear interest at Eurodollar,
money market or base rates, at our option, plus an applicable margin.   The credit agreements contain financial
and other covenants, including but not limited to, covenants requiring maintenance of minimum tangible net working capital and
compliance with leverage ratios, as well as an ownership minimum and limitations on other indebtedness, liens, distributions or
dividends, and investments and dispositions of assets.   As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with
all covenants under this credit agreement. 

Both credit agreements provide that amounts
under the facilities may be borrowed and repaid, and re-borrowed, subject to a borrowing base test. The committed and uncommitted
lines of credit mature June 19, 2017.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the credit utilized amounted to,
respectively, $160,994, and $158,922 (including approximately $61,994, and $27,922 of outstanding letters of credit). As of September
30, 2016 the committed line of credit had loans outstanding of $84,000 and the uncommitted line of credit had loans outstanding
of $15,000. 

The Company s wholly owned Belgian subsidiary,
Imbali, maintained a line of credit with ING Belgium S.A./N.V., ( ING ) for a EUR 8,000 (US$8,992) commitment for loans
and documentary letters of credit. On July 30, 2015, Imbali entered into an uncommitted credit agreement with Rabobank International
for EUR 12,500 (US$14,050) to replace ING and utilized EUR 4,000 (US$4,496) of borrowings under the Rabobank facility to repay
the outstanding balance due to ING. Loan advances are limited to a percentage of Imbali s pledged accounts receivables and
inventory and bear interest at EURIBOR plus 1.9%. This secured credit arrangement is unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.
As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding loan amounted to EUR 8,830 (US$9,925) and letters of credit of $2,208. As of December
31, 2015, the outstanding loan amounted to EUR 7,500 (US$8,430) and letters of credit of $1,500. As of September 30, 2016, Imbali
was in compliance with all financial covenants.

10. Convertible Subordinated Debt  

On June 3, 2011, the Company issued $12,000
principal amount of 10% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes Due June 1, 2016 in a private placement to selected accredited investors.  On
June 1, 2016, the remaining $11,000 principal amount of outstanding notes was repaid in full. Prior to the repayment, the notes
were convertible at the option of the note holders into shares of common stock at a conversion rate of 265.82 shares of common
stock per $1 principal amount of notes (equivalent to a conversion price of $3.762 per share of common stock), subject to dilutive
adjustment for cash and stock dividends, stock splits and similar transactions, at any time before maturity.  The last
conversion price reflected twenty adjustments for dividends declared on the Company s common stock since the issuance of
the notes. Interest on the notes was payable in arrears on the first day of June and December every year the notes were outstanding.
The purchase agreement pursuant to which the notes were issued contained covenants, including restrictions on the Company s
ability to incur certain indebtedness and create certain liens. Officers and directors of the Company and certain affiliated entities
purchased $4,000 principal amount of the notes. 

As a result of transactions which caused adjustments
to the conversion rate, the embedded conversion option was bifurcated and recorded as a separate derivative liability at a fair
value at issuance of the notes of $2,829, with a corresponding discount recorded on the notes. The derivative liability was carried
at fair value with changes therein recorded in income. The quarterly mark to market of the derivative liability resulted in non-operating,
non-cash gains or losses based on decreases or increases in the Company s stock price, respectively, among other factors.
The non-cash discount was being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the notes. The change in the fair value
of the derivative liability resulted in a loss of $0 and $224 during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively and gains of $942 and $1,184 during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. Amortization
of the discount amounted to $0 and $130 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $216 and
$457 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. 

The derivative liability had a carrying value
of $0 at maturity on June 1, 2016. Prior to maturity the derivative liability was valued using a lattice model using unobservable
level 3 inputs. This technique was selected because it embodies all of the types of inputs that the Company expects market participants
would consider in determining the fair value of equity linked derivatives embedded in hybrid debt agreements. 

The following table summarizes the significant
inputs resulting from the calculations as of December 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and issuance: 

The majority of proceeds of the convertible
subordinated debt was earmarked for a long term advance in connection with a supply agreement with the Indonesian company PT. Alumindo
Light Metal Industry Tbk, (PT. Alumindo) a leading producer of high quality semi-finished aluminum products, and its affiliates. 
The agreement called for, and the Company provided a $10,000 non-interest bearing loan to an affiliate of PT. Alumindo to enable
the expansion of capacity within that group of companies  production network.  The agreements also provided for
a long term, multi-year substantial and preferential supply position from PT. Alumindo's premier aluminum rolling mill located
in Surabaya, Indonesia.   The loan was being repaid to the Company beginning on January 1, 2013 in monthly installments
of $278 and was fully repaid on December 1, 2015. 

-  11  - 

11. Earnings per Share   

Basic earnings per share are based upon weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are based upon the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period, plus potential dilutive shares of common stock from assumed
exercise of the outstanding stock options using the treasury stock method and assumed conversion of subordinated debt. The convertible
debt is assumed to have been converted at the beginning of the period and the related dilutive common shares assumed issued upon
conversion are included in the denominator for the period up to the date the debt was repaid. 

The following table sets forth the computation
of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

In computing earnings per share for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 no effect has been given to the 2,884 common shares, issuable on conversion of subordinated debt
as their effect is anti-dilutive. 

12. Dividends  

On March 23, 2016, the Company announced a
cash dividend of $0.025 per share to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 5, 2016. The dividend, totaling $212,
was paid on April 12, 2016. On June 29, 2016 the Company announced a cash dividend of $0.04 per share to stockholders of record
at the close of business on July 14, 2016. The dividend totaling $340 was paid on July 22, 2016. On September 14, 2016 the Company
announced a cash dividend of $0.04 per share to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 30, 2016. The dividend
totaling $339 was paid on October 7, 2016. The Board of Directors will review its dividend policy on a quarterly basis, and make
a determination regarding future dividends subject to the profitability and free cash flow and the other requirements of the business. 

13. Derivative Financial Instruments and
Risk Management  

The Company uses derivative financial instruments
designated as fair value hedges to manage its exposure to commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk inherent in its
operations. It is the Company s policy to hedge such risks to the extent practicable. The Company enters into high-grade
aluminum futures contracts to limit its gross margin exposure by hedging the metal content element of firmly committed purchase
and sales commitments. The Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its exposure related to commitments
to buy and sell metals as well as its accounts receivable denominated in international currencies.

in respect of its fair value hedges measured at fair value are as follows:

For the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, hedge ineffectiveness associated with derivatives designated as fair value hedges was
insignificant, and no fair value hedges were derecognized. 

The table below summarizes the realized gains
or (losses) of the Company s derivative instruments and their location in the income statement: 

a)  Fair value hedge: the related hedged item is accounts receivable and offsetting losses in
                                                                the                                                                 three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and gains
                                                                in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are included in cost of goods sold in the same respective
                                                                amounts.   

b)  Fair value hedge: the related hedged item is inventory and offsetting gains in the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and offsetting losses in the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 are included in cost of goods sold in the same respective amounts.   

14. Fair Value  

Authoritative guidance defines fair value as
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, as described below: 

Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.     

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices
included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.    

Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant
to the fair value measurement and unobservable.     

Derivative contracts consisting of aluminum
contracts and foreign currency contracts are valued using quoted market prices and significant other observable inputs. These financial
instruments are typically exchange-traded and are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending
on whether the exchange is deemed to be an active market or not. 

-  13  - 

Major categories of assets and liabilities
measured at fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are classified as follows: 

15. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The carrying amounts of variable rate notes
payable to the banks approximate fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, because these notes reflect market
changes to interest rates. The fair value of the subordinated convertible debt approximates its principal amount of $11,000 at
December 31, 2015, which exceeds its carrying amount as a result of the unamortized discount related to the bifurcation of the
embedded conversion option. Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value (see Note 13). 

16. Business Segment and Geographic Area
Information  

The Company s only business segment is
the sale and distribution of metals. Sales are attributed to countries based on location of customers as follows: 

-  14  - 

17. Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss)  

Changes in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) are as follows: 

18. Commitments   

The Company had $64,202 in outstanding letters
of credit to certain of its suppliers at September 30, 2016 and $29,422 at December 31, 2015. 

19. Income Taxes  

For interim income tax reporting, the Company
estimates its annual effective tax rate and applies it to its year to date ordinary income. The effect on the tax rate related
to income or loss attributable to the change in value of the derivative liability is separately computed and recognized as such
income or loss occurs. The disproportionate relationship between income taxes and pre-tax income for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, results primarily from no deferred tax being provided on the non-taxable gain resulting from the change in the value
of the derivative liability to the extent the gain exceeds the $216 amortization of the related debt discount for which a deferred
tax benefit is provided. 

The disproportionate relationship between income
taxes and pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, results primarily from no deferred tax being provided on
the non-taxable gain resulting from the change in the value of the derivative liability to the extent such gains exceeds the $457
amortization of the related debt discount, for which a deferred tax benefit is provided. 

The disproportionate relationship between income
taxes and pre-tax income for the three months ended September 30, 2015, results primarily from no tax benefit being recognized
on the non-deductible loss resulting from the change in the value of the derivative liability.

                                         improve operating margins and efficiencies.   

For a discussion of these and other risks
that relate to our business and investing in shares of our common stock, you should carefully review the risk factors and
other cautionary statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 described under the
heading  Part II - Item 1A Risk Factors  and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and those
described from time to time in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are expressly qualified in their entirety by this
cautionary statement. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect events

Our Business  

We are engaged in the purchase, sale and distribution
of semi-finished aluminum and steel products to a diverse customer base located in the Americas, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
We sell our products through our own marketing and sales personnel as well as through commission based independent sales agents
located in North America and Europe. We purchase products from suppliers located throughout the world. Our three largest suppliers
furnished approximately 54% of our products during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to an aggregate of 44% of our products
during the same period in 2015. We place orders with our suppliers based upon orders that we receive from our customers and also
purchase material for our own stock, which we typically use for shorter term deliveries to our customers. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in our financial statements. The financial statements include estimates based on currently available information and our judgment
as to the outcome of future conditions and circumstances. Significant estimates in these financial statements include allowance
for doubtful accounts. Changes in the status of certain facts or circumstances could result in material changes to the estimates
used in the preparation of the financial statements and actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions. 

Among the significant judgments made by management
in the preparation of our financial statements are the following: 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  

As of September 30, 2016, we had $64,143 in
trade receivables, after an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,192. We report accounts receivable, net of an allowance for
doubtful accounts, to represent our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy of
our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical collection trends, age of receivables, as well as review
of specific accounts, and make adjustments in the allowance that we believe are necessary. We maintain credit insurance policies
on the majority of our customers. In general, this policy has a 10% deductible; however there are some instances where the co-insurance
may vary and instances where we may exceed the insured values. Changes in economic conditions could have an impact on the collection
of existing receivable balances or future allowance considerations. In addition, changes in the credit insurance environment could
affect the availability of credit insurance and our ability to secure it. 

Accruals for Inventory Claims  

Generally, our exposure on claims for defective
material is relatively small, as we usually refer all claims on defects back to our suppliers. If we do not believe that a supplier
will honor a material claim for a defective product, we will record an allowance for inventory adjustments. 

Results of Operations  

General   

We are engaged in the purchase, sale and distribution
of semi-finished aluminum and steel products which we purchase from producing mills around the world.  The market prices
of materials we purchase, as well as the market price of materials we sell, fluctuate constantly in world markets.  Our cost
of sales is composed of metal content, which in part is determined on world metal exchanges, plus a unique fabrication premium
charged by each producer to convert the raw metal to a semi-finished product.  In turn, we typically sell to our customers
either on a fixed price basis or based on metal content plus a premium which includes supplier fabrication margin, and costs of
importation, warehousing, and delivery of material to customers.  Since metal content costs are the largest component of
cost of sales and selling price, our sales pricing trends and cost of sales trends generally track consistently.

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, net sales decreased by $8,351, from $121,950 to $113,599 or 6.8 % from the same period in 2015.   Sales in all
areas declined with the exception of Canadian sales which increased by $952 quarter over quarter. The largest decline was a decline
of $6,156 in the United States, impacted by softer customer demand during the period. 

Gross profit increased by $164, to $5,511
during the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $5,347 in the same period of 2015, representing a 3.1% increase. As a result
of reduced inventory levels and our purchase of a new warehouse in the fourth quarter of 2015, we were able to achieve reduced
storage, freight and handling costs, yielding a positive impact on gross profit. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $241 from $3,094 to $3,335. The increases in selling, general and
administrative are primarily due to increases in consulting expenses, accruals for payroll and office expenses. 

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, interest expense decreased 45% or $633 to $786 from $1,419 for the same period in 2015 as a result of decreased bank loans
due to reduced inventory levels as well as the elimination of interest on the subordinated debt, as such debt was repaid in full
on June 1, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest on our 10% Convertible Senior Subordinated
Notes Due June 1, 2016 totaled $0 and $275, respectively.   Amortization of the debt discount in
connection with these notes totaled $0 and $130 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. 

The 10% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes
Due June 1, 2016 had an embedded conversion option which was bifurcated and recorded as a separate derivative liability at a fair
value at issuance of the notes. The derivative liability was carried at fair value with changes in mark to market recorded in
income. There were no changes in the fair value of the derivative liability during the three month period ended September 30,
2016 as compared to a $224 non-cash non-operating loss during the same period in 2015. 

During the three months ended September 30,
2016 income before income taxes increased by $780 from $610 to $1,390 or 128%. This increase is primarily due to the reduction
in interest expense as well as the improved gross profit, offset by slightly higher SG A and the elimination of the revaluation
of the derivative liability. 

Fair value accounting requires changes in
derivative liabilities related to our convertible notes to be charged or credited to income during each accounting period. Such
losses are not tax deductible, and likewise any recoveries of such losses are not taxable upon recovery. Accordingly, no tax effect
was given to the September 2015 non-cash, non-operating loss of $224, and therefore the tax rate for the quarter ended September
30, 2016 was 36.1% and 48.4% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 

Net income increased by $573 to $888 during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $315 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net income
of $573 or 181.9% is primarily the result of decreases in interest expense, improved gross profit margins, offset by reduced sales
for the quarter. 

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, net sales decreased by $66,454, from $424,689 to $358,235 or 15.6 % from the same period in 2015. Sales in all regions,
except for Europe declined in 2016 as compared to 2015.   Our sales in North America declined by
$55,237 comprised of a decline in both our aluminum and steel sales. 

Gross profit decreased by $1,502, to $16,699
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $18,201 in the same period of 2015, representing a 8.3% decrease, attributable
to reduced sales, offset by improved gross profit margins. As a result of reduced inventory levels and our purchase of a new warehouse
in the fourth quarter of 2015, we were able to achieve reduced storage, freight and handling costs, yielding a positive impact
on gross profit. Additionally, we negotiated lower ocean freight rates due to softer container line shipping market conditions. 

-  18  - 

Selling, general and administrative expenses
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $714 from $10,632 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015
to $9,918 primarily as a result of lower compensation costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, offset by increased unused bank
commitment fees and consulting fees. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, interest expense decreased 32.9% or $1,537 to $3,128 from $4,665 for the same period in 2015 as a result of decreased bank
loans due to reduced inventory levels as well as the elimination of interest on the subordinated debt for the last four months
of the period as such debt was repaid in full on June 1, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest
on our 10% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes Due June 1, 2016 totaled $458 and $825, respectively. 
 Amortization of the debt discount in connection with these notes totaled $216 and $457 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 income before change in value of derivative liability increased by $749 from $2,904 to $3,653 or 25.8%. This
increase is due to reduced interest expense, reduced selling, general and administrative expenses offset by reduced gross
profit due to the decline in sales. 

The 10% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes
Due June 1, 2016 had an embedded conversion option which was bifurcated and recorded as a separate derivative liability at a fair
value at issuance of the notes. The derivative liability was carried at fair value with changes in mark to market recorded in
income. The changes in the fair value of the derivative liability resulted in a non-cash non-operating gain of $942 during the
nine month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a $1,184 non-cash non-operating gain during the same period in 2015.
The valuation has numerous inputs, however, these changes were driven primarily by the change in the stock price at the end of
both quarters. 

Fair value accounting requires changes in
derivative liabilities related to our convertible notes to be charged or credited to income during each accounting period. Such
losses are not tax deductible, and likewise any recoveries of such losses are not taxable upon recovery. Accordingly, no tax effect
was given to the non-cash, non-operating gains of $942 and $1,184, to the extent they exceeded the amortization of the related
debt discount during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Accordingly, the tax rate for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 34.7% and 32.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net income increased to $2,999 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 from a $2,774 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 an increase of $225. This increase
is the result of reduced sales for the nine month period ending September 30, 2016, offset by lower operating and interest expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Overview    

At September 30, 2016, we had cash of $5,719,
net accounts receivable of $64,143, and senior secured debt of $99,000.  Management believes that cash from operations,
together with funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements relating to our existing
operations for the next twelve months. However, we will require additional debt or equity financing in connection with future
expansion of operations.

Comparison of Nine Month Periods Ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Net cash provided by operating activities
was $41,768 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $39,254 during the same period in 2015. In the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from decreases in inventories of $40,209,
offset by increases in trade accounts receivable of $3,790 and decreases in accounts payable of $9,341. 

Our days sales outstanding
remained relatively stable at 48 days for September 2016 and 49 days for September 2015 periods. Our inventory in
warehouses, available for delivery to customers, as of September 2015 was approximately 80 days of sales as compared to 64
days as of the same date in 2016. Total inventory levels have been reduced by $40,209 since December 2015, as we continue to
manage our inventory downwards to align with our sales volume and improve inventory turns. Our inventory turn rate, including
materials in transit, was 3.7 times or 98 days on hand, as of September 30, 2015 as compared to 4.1 times or 88 days on hand
as of September 30, 2016. The days payable outstanding was 24 days as of September 2016, as compared to 17 days for the same
period in 2015. 

Cash flows used in and provided by investing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amounted to $159 and $2,263 respectively. During 2015, this
was primarily the monthly repayment by PT. Alumindo of the advance related to our supply agreement, which was repaid in full as
of the end of 2015. 

Cash flows used in financing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, amounted to $43,080, as compared to $37,067 during the same period in 2015.  During
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 we reduced notes payable to banks by $30,514 as compared to $33,978 in notes payable
during the same period of 2015. In addition, on June 1, 2016, we repaid the $11,000 of our 10% Convertible Subordinated Debt in
full. 

Credit Agreements and Other Debt 

On June 19, 2014 we entered into an amended
and restated committed credit agreement with Rabobank International, for itself and as lead arranger and agent, BNP Paribas, for
itself and as syndication agent, and Soci t  G n rale, ABN AMRO, RB International, and Brown Brothers
Harriman as well as a new uncommitted line of credit with Rabobank International, BNP Paribas and Soci t  G n rale.
Both credit lines are secured, asset-based credit facilities. The committed credit facility provided for amounts up to $150,000,
and the uncommitted facility provided for a maximum amount of $75,000. The agreement also allowed for an additional increase in
the committed credit facility of $75,000, for a total of $300,000, subject to certain restrictions and conditions. On December
18, 2014, these lines were amended and increased the working capital credit agreement by $50,000 increasing the overall line of
credit to $275,000. The amended committed credit agreement was increased by $35,000 to $185,000, and the uncommitted credit facility
was increased by $15,000 to $90,000. On June 14, 2016 we amended the committed credit facility by reducing the facility to $162,500.
In addition, we also amended the uncommitted credit facility by reducing the facility to $50,000, and extending the termination
date to June 19, 2017. There are no changes to the interest rate or to the maturity date of the committed facility, which remains
June 19, 2017. Subsequent to these amendments the additional increase available under the terms of the committed credit facility
is $40,000, subject to certain restrictions and conditions. Borrowings under this line of credit are secured by substantially
all of our assets. During the first half of 2017, prior to the expiration of the credit agreements, we expect to renew our credit
agreements,  however there can be no assurances that we will be able to
successfully conclude new agreements.  

Amounts borrowed bear interest at Eurodollar,
money market or base rates, at our option, plus an applicable margin.   The credit agreements contain financial
and other covenants, including but not limited to, covenants requiring maintenance of minimum tangible net working capital and
compliance with leverage ratios, as well as an ownership minimum and limitations on other indebtedness, liens, distributions or
dividends, and investments and dispositions of assets.   As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants
under this credit agreement. 

Both credit agreements provide that amounts
under the facilities may be borrowed and repaid, and re-borrowed, subject to a borrowing base test. The committed and uncommitted
lines of credit mature June 19, 2017.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the credit utilized amounted
to, respectively, $160,994, and $158,922 (including approximately $61,994, and $27,922 of outstanding letters of credit). As of
September 30, 2016, the committed line of credit had loans outstanding of $84,000 and the uncommitted line of credit had loans
outstanding of $15,000.

Our wholly owned Belgian subsidiary, Imbali,
maintained a line of credit with ING Belgium S.A./N.V., ( ING ) for a EUR 8,000 (US$8,992) commitment for loans and
documentary letters of credit. On July 30, 2015, Imbali entered into an uncommitted credit agreement with Rabobank International
for EUR 12,500 (US$14,050) to replace ING and utilized EUR 4,000 (US$4,496) of borrowings under the Rabobank facility to repay
the outstanding balance due to ING. Loan advances are limited to a percentage of Imbali s pledged accounts receivables and
inventory and bear interest at EURIBOR plus 1.9%. This secured credit arrangement is unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.
As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding loan amounted to EUR 8,830 (US$9,925) and letters of credit of $2,208. As of December
31, 2015, the outstanding loan amounted to EUR 7,500 (US$8,430) and letters of credit of $1,500. As of September 30, 2016, Imbali
was in compliance with all financial covenants. 

On June 3, 2011, we issued $12,000 principal
amount of 10% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes Due June 1, 2016 in a private placement to selected accredited investors.  
On June 1, 2016, the remaining $11,000 principal amount of outstanding notes were repaid in full. Prior to the repayment, the
notes were convertible at the option of the note holders into shares of common stock at a conversion rate of 265.82 shares of
common stock per $1 principal amount of notes (equivalent to a conversion price of $3.762 per share of common stock), subject
to dilutive adjustment for cash and stock dividends, stock splits and similar transactions, at any time before maturity.  The
last conversion price reflected twenty adjustments for dividends declared on our common stock since the issuance of the notes. Interest
on the notes was payable in arrears on the first day of June and December every year the notes were outstanding. The purchase
agreement pursuant to which the notes were issued contained covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur certain
indebtedness and create certain liens. 

Derivative Financial Instruments   

Inherent in our business is the risk of matching
the timing of our purchase and sales contracts. The prices of the aluminum products we buy and sell are based on a constantly
moving terminal market price determined by the London Metal Exchange. Were we not to hedge such exposures, we could be exposed
to significant losses due to the continually changing aluminum prices. 

We use aluminum futures contracts to manage
our exposure to this commodity price risk. It is generally our policy to hedge such risks to the extent practicable. We enter
into hedges to limit our exposure to volatile price fluctuations that we believe would impact our gross margins on firm purchase
and sales commitments. As an example, if we enter into fixed price contracts with our suppliers and variable priced sales contracts
with our customers, we will generally enter into a futures contract to sell the aluminum for future delivery in the month when
the aluminum is to be priced and delivered to the customer and repurchase this position once the pricing has been fixed with our
customer.  If the underlying metal price increases, we suffer a hedging loss and have a derivative liability, but the
sales price to the customer is based on a higher market price and offsets the loss. Conversely, if the metal price decreases,
we have a hedging gain and recognize a derivative asset, but the sales price to the customer is based on the lower market price
and offsets the gain. 

We also enter into foreign exchange forward
contracts to hedge our exposure related to commitments to purchase or sell metals and accounts receivable denominated in some
international currencies. In such cases, we will purchase or sell the foreign currency through a bank for an approximate date
when we anticipate making a payment to a supplier or receiving payment from the foreign customer. 

In accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the U.S., we designate these derivative contracts as fair value hedges and recognize them on our balance sheet at
fair value.  We also recognize offsetting changes in the fair value of the related firm purchase and sales commitment
to which the hedge is attributable in earnings upon revenue recognition, which occurs at the time of delivery to our customers. 

The potential for losses related to our hedging
activities, given our hedging methodology, arises from counterparty defaults with banks for our foreign exchange hedging, the
London Metal Exchange for our aluminum hedges, or customer defaults. In the event of a customer default, we might be forced to
sell the material in the open market and absorb losses for metal or foreign exchange hedges that were applied to the defaulting
customers  transactions. Our results of operations could be materially impacted by any counterparty or customer default,
as we might not be able to collect money owed to us and/or our hedge might effectively be cancelled. 

We use futures and forward contracts as hedges,
for no purpose other than to avoid exposure to changes in aluminum prices and foreign currency rates between when we buy a shipment
of aluminum from a supplier and when we deliver it to a customer.  Our derivatives are not for purposes of trading in
the futures market. We earn our gross profit margin through our business operations and not from the movement of aluminum prices. 

-  21  - 

As part of our business we also engage in
the purchase, sale and distribution of steel products. If we do not have a matching sales contract related to such products, (for
example, any steel products that are unsold in our inventory), we have price risk that we currently do not or are unable to hedge.
As such, any decline in pricing for such products may adversely impact our profitability. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Item 3.      Quantitative
                                         and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

Not required. 

Item 4.      Controls
                                         and Procedures  

Management s Conclusions Regarding
Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As of September 30, 2016, we conducted an
evaluation, under the supervision and participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any
system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance
level as of September 30, 2016. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There was no change in our internal
control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the
Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
