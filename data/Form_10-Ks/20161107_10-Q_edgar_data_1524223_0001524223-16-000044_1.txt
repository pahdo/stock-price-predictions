  Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Company believes that the disclosures herein are adequate so that the information presented is not misleading; however, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The financial data for the interim periods may not necessarily be indicative of results for future interim periods or for the full year.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Basis of Presentation  
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and related rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial reporting and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim period. 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates or assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates or assumptions. 
  The Company changed its presentation of goodwill within its consolidated statements of financial condition from a component of total "Other long-term assets" to "Goodwill". Amounts for the comparative prior fiscal year period have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This reclassification had no impact on previously reported total assets or financial position and does not represent a restatement of any previously published financial results. Other long-term assets at   December 31, 2015  , previously reported as   $1.3 million  , is   $0.4 million   as reclassified. Goodwill at   December 31, 2015   is   $0.9 million   as reclassified. 
  Revision of Previously Reported Consolidated Statements of Operations 
  In the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company revised its treatment of payments made to certain advisory clients, in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") 605-50,   Revenue Recognition - Customer Payments and Incentives   to properly present these payments as a reduction to revenue. The Company assessed the materiality of this item on its fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and all prior and subsequent periods, and concluded that the reclassification was not material to any such periods. The statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 included herein have been revised to reflect the proper presentation of investment management services revenue and distribution, servicing and custody expenses. The reclassification has no impact on operating income or net income. The impact is illustrated below: 

Principles of Consolidation 
  The Company consolidates all majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , Manning   Napier holds an economic interest of approximately   17.4%   in Manning   Napier Group but, as managing member, controls all of the business and affairs of Manning   Napier Group. As a result, the Company consolidates the financial results of Manning   Napier Group and records a noncontrolling interest on its consolidated statements of financial condition with respect to the remaining economic interest in Manning   Napier Group held by Manning   Napier Group Holdings, LLC ( M N Group Holdings ) and Manning   Napier Capital Company, LLC ( MNCC ). 
  All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810)   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entity s purpose and design, a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, and whether a company is obligated to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. The standard also requires ongoing assessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ( VIE ).  
  The Company provides seed capital to its investment teams to develop new products and services for its clients. The original seed investment may represent all or a majority of the equity investment in the new product. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, the Company evaluates its seed investments on a regular basis and consolidates such investments for which it holds a controlling financial interest.

    Manning   Napier, Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The Company serves as the investment adviser for Manning   Napier Fund, Inc. series of mutual funds (the  Fund ), Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts ( CIT ), Rainier Investment Management Mutual Funds and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust. The Fund, CIT, Rainier Investment Management Mutual Funds and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust are legal entities, the business and affairs of which are managed by their respective boards of directors. As a result, each of these entities is a voting interest entity ( VOE ). The Company holds, in limited cases, direct investments in a fund (which are made on the same terms as are available to other investors) and consolidates each of these entities where it has a controlling financial interest or a majority voting interest. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in operating accounts at major financial institutions and also in money market securities. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value due to the short-term maturity of these investments. The fair value of cash equivalents have been classified as Level 1 in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. 
  Investment Securities 
  Investment securities are classified as either trading or available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Fair value is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical or similar instruments. 
  Investment securities classified as trading consist of equity securities, fixed income securities, and investments in mutual funds and hedge funds for which the Company provides advisory services. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are recorded in net gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. At   September 30, 2016  , trading securities consist solely of investments held by the Company to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes.  
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired companies. Identifiable intangible assets generally represent the cost of client relationships and investment management agreements acquired as well as trademarks. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets subject to amortization are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangible assets require significant management estimate and judgment, including the valuation and expected life determination in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment. 
  Operating Segments 
  The Company operates in   one   segment, the investment management industry. The Company primarily provides investment management services to separately managed accounts, mutual funds and collective investment trust funds. Management assesses the financial performance of these vehicles on a combined basis. 
  Revenue 
  The majority of the Company s revenues are based on fees charged to manage customers  portfolios. Investment management fees are generally computed as a percentage of assets under management ("AUM") and recognized as earned. Fees for providing investment advisory services are computed and billed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable investment management agreements. For the Company s separately managed accounts, clients either pay investment management fees in advance, typically for a semi-annual or quarterly period, or in arrears, typically for a monthly or quarterly period. When investment management fees are paid in advance, the Company defers the revenue and recognizes it over the applicable period. When investment management fees are paid in arrears, the Company estimates revenues based on AUM market values as of the most recent month end date, and adjusts to actual when billed. For mutual funds and collective investment trust vehicles, the Company s fees are calculated and earned daily based on AUM. 
  The Company has agreements with third parties who provide distribution and administrative services for its mutual funds, collective investment trusts and certain separately managed accounts. Third party agreements are evaluated against Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ASC 605-45   Revenue Recognition - Principal Agent Considerations   to determine whether revenue should be reported gross or net of payments to third-party service providers. In management's judgment there are various indicators that support gross revenue reporting, the most notable being the Company acts as primary obligor and therefore principal service provider. Based on this evaluation, investment management service revenue is recorded gross of distribution and administrative fees paid to third parties.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Advisory Agreements 
  The Company derives significant revenue from its role as advisor to the Fund and the CIT. 
  The Company's investments in the Fund amounted to approximately   $1.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $1.2 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  Fees earned for advisory related services provided to the Fund and CIT investment vehicles were approximately   $24.8 million   and   $78.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively and   $35.1 million   and   $121.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. These amounts represent greater than 10% of the Company's revenue in each respective period. 
  Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment is presented net of accumulated depreciation of approximately   $11.6 million   and   $8.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which supersedes existing accounting standards for revenue recognition and creates a single framework. The new guidance will be effective on January 1, 2018 and requires either a retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adoption. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating its transition method and the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,   which requires all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. ASU 2016-01 will be effective on January 1, 2018 and will result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet upon adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-01 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing all lease transactions (with terms in excess of 12 months) on the balance sheet as a lease liability and a right-of-use asset (as defined). The new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with earlier application permitted. Upon adoption, the lessee will apply the new standard retrospectively to all periods presented or retrospectively using a cumulative effect adjustment in the year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Stock Compensation (Topic 718),   which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions. The guidance will be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Note 3 Acquisitions 
  On   April 30, 2016  , the Company acquired a majority ownership interest in Rainier Investment Management, LLC ("Rainier ), an active investment management firm. Rainier specializes in capitalization-based U.S. and non-U.S. equity strategies and is headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company acquired a   75%   ownership interest in Rainier, with the remaining   25%   ownership maintained by key professionals at Rainier. The transaction serves to further diversify the Company's product offerings, enhance its positioning as a provider to defined contribution plans, and broaden its geographic coverage of the western United States. 
  Consideration transferred included an upfront cash payment on the transaction closing date of   $13.0 million  . Additional cash payments of up to   $32.5 million   over a   four   year period are contingent upon Rainier s achievement of certain annual financial targets. The fair value of the liability for this contingent consideration recognized on the acquisition date was   $3.5 million  . As of   September 30, 2016   the fair value of the contingent liability was   $3.0 million  , of which   $0.4 million   is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities with the remainder in other long-term liabilities within the consolidated statements of financial condition.  
  The transaction was accounted for by the Company using the acquisition method under ASC 805,   Business Combinations  . The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the   April 30, 2016   purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands):

    Manning   Napier, Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The amounts allocated to the Rainier assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary pending completion of the final purchase price allocation, primarily in the area of accounting for income taxes. The goodwill of   $4.0 million   represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and, in management's opinion, is largely attributable to the value expected from the synergies created through the integration of Rainier's operations, the reputation and expertise of Rainier in the asset management industry, and the existing workforce of Rainier. The goodwill recognized as a result of the acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
  The intangible assets for client relationships include those for separately managed accounts, mutual funds, and collective investment trusts. The client relationships for separately managed accounts were valued at   $1.5 million   and are being amortized over an estimated useful life of   6   years. Those for mutual funds and collective investment trusts, valued at approximately   $7.8 million  , are indefinite-lived, and as such, are not being amortized. 
  The acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation with various unobservable market data inputs, which are Level 3 measurements. Significant unobservable inputs included projected revenue growth, projected EBITDA margins and discount rates over the   four   year earn-out period. For purposes of the simulation, EBITDA generally means net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense. A summary of various assumption values follows: 

Significant increases (decreases) in projected AUM or revenue could result in a significantly higher (lower) contingent consideration liability fair value. 
  The   25%   ownership maintained by key professionals at Rainier is subject to service-based vesting over the   five  -year period following the acquisition. The Company has the option to repurchase any vested ownership interests upon termination of employment, at a price based on the post-acquisition financial results of Rainier for the most recent   four  -quarter period preceding the employee's termination date. This repurchase price is recognized as a liability within the consolidated statements of financial condition. The carrying value of this liability was   $0   on the acquisition date, and   $0.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
   
  Note 4 Noncontrolling Interests 
  Manning   Napier holds an economic interest of approximately   17.4%   in Manning   Napier Group, but as managing member controls all of the business and affairs of Manning   Napier Group. As a result, the Company consolidates the financial results of Manning   Napier Group and records a noncontrolling interest on its consolidated statement of financial condition with respect to the remaining approximately   82.6%   aggregate economic interest in Manning   Napier Group held by M N Group Holdings and MNCC. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the statements of operations represents the portion of earnings attributable to the economic interest in Manning   Napier Group held by the noncontrolling interests.

    Manning   Napier, Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The following provides a reconciliation from  Income before provision for income taxes  to  Net income attributable to Manning   Napier, Inc. : 
      
 ________________________ 
           a) 
    Manning   Napier, Inc. incurs certain gains or expenses that are only attributable to it and are therefore excluded from the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
              b) 
    Income before provision for income taxes is allocated to the controlling interest based on the percentage of units of Manning   Napier Group held by Manning   Napier, Inc. The amount represents the Company's weighted ownership of Manning   Napier Group for the respective periods. 
              c) 
    The consolidated provision for income taxes is equal to the sum of (i) the provision for income taxes for entities other than Manning   Napier, Inc. and (ii) the provision for income taxes of Manning   Napier, Inc. which includes all U.S. federal and state income taxes. The consolidated provision for income taxes was   $1.6 million   and   $4.8 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively and a benefit of   $1.6 million   and provision of   $3.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
       
   A total of   65,784,571   units of Manning   Napier Group are held by the noncontrolling interests as of   September 30, 2016  . Pursuant to the terms of the exchange agreement entered into at the time of the Company's initial public offering, such units may be exchangeable for shares of the Company's Class A common stock. For any units exchanged, the Company will (i) pay an amount of cash equal to the number of units exchanged multiplied by the value of one share of the Company's Class A common stock less a market discount and expected expenses, or, at the Company's election, (ii) issue shares of the Company's Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary adjustments. As the Company receives units of Manning   Napier Group that are exchanged, the Company's ownership of Manning   Napier Group will increase.  
  On April 27, 2016, M N Group Holdings and MNCC exchanged a total of   2,111,913   Class A units of Manning   Napier Group for approximately   $16.1 million   in cash. Subsequent to the exchange, the Class A units were retired. In addition, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , equity awards issued under the 2011 Equity Compensation Plan (the "Equity Plan") vested (Note 12) for which Manning   Napier, Inc. acquired an equivalent number of Class A units of Manning   Napier Group. These acquisitions of additional operating membership interests were treated as reorganizations of entities under common control as required by ASC 805 "  Business Combination  ". As a result of the aforementioned transactions, the Company's economic ownership in Manning   Napier Group increased to   17.4%  . 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had recorded a liability of   $38.7 million   and   $41.9 million  , respectively, representing the estimated payments due to the selling unit holders under the tax receivable agreement ("TRA") entered into between Manning   Napier and the other holders of Class A Units of Manning   Napier Group. Of these amounts,   $2.4 million   and   $3.3 million   were included in accrued expenses and other liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company made payments of approximately   $3.4 million   and   $2.1 million   pursuant to the TRA during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

Obligations pursuant to the TRA are obligations of Manning   Napier. They do not impact the noncontrolling interests. These obligations are not income tax obligations. Furthermore, the TRA has no impact on the allocation of the provision for income taxes to the Company s net income. 
   
  Note 5 Investment Securities 
  The following represents the Company s investment securities holdings as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :   

Investment securities are classified as either trading or available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Fair value is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical or similar instruments. 
  Investment securities classified as trading consist of equity securities, fixed income securities and investments in mutual funds for which the Company provides advisory services. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , trading securities consist solely of investments held by the Company to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes. The Company recognized approximately $  1.6 million   of net unrealized gains and $  2.4 million   of net unrealized losses related to investments classified as trading during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Investment securities classified as available-for-sale consist of U.S. Treasury notes for compliance with certain regulatory requirements. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $0.6 million   of these securities was considered restricted. The Company periodically reviews each individual security position that has an unrealized loss, or impairment, to determine if that impairment is other-than-temporary. No other-than-temporary impairment charges have been recognized by the Company during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Note 6 Derivative Instruments 
  The Company may enter into futures contracts for product development purposes. Futures are commitments either to purchase or sell a designated financial instrument, currency, commodity or an index at a specified future date for a specified price and may be settled in cash or another financial asset. Upon entering into a futures contract, the Company is required to pledge to the broker an amount of cash, which is reported in due from broker within the consolidated statements of financial condition. Futures contracts have little credit risk because the counterparties are futures exchanges. The Company does not hold any derivatives in a formal hedge relationship under ASC 815-10,   Derivatives and Hedging. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no open futures contracts. The following table presents the notional value and fair value as of   December 31, 2015   for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments: 

As of   December 31, 2015  , the derivative assets and liabilities were included in due from broker in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Derivative activity concluded on February 4, 2016 with a year to date average volume of derivative activity (measured in terms of notional value) of approximately   $127.8 million  . The average notional volume of derivative activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was approximately   $238.5 million  . The following table presents the gains (losses) recognized in net gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :       

  The Company discloses information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position in accordance with ASU 2011-11,   Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities  . The derivatives instruments are subject to a master netting agreement allowing for the netting of assets and liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position.

Note 7 Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value is defined as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market of the investment. A fair value hierarchy is provided that gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). 
  The following three-tier fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value: 
     Level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; 
             
    Level 2 other significant observable inputs (including but not limited to quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment rates, credit risk, etc.); and 
                
    Level 3 significant unobservable inputs (including the Company s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments). 
     The following provides the hierarchy of inputs used to derive the fair value of the Company s financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :    

Valuations of investments in fixed income securities and U.S. Treasury notes can generally be obtained through independent pricing services. For most bond types, the pricing service utilizes matrix pricing, which considers one or more of the following factors: yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity, current cash flows, type and current day trade information, as well as dealer supplied prices. These valuations are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. 
  Contingent consideration was a component of the purchase price of Rainier. The contingent consideration is payable over a   four   year period upon Rainier s achievement of certain financial targets. The fair value of the contingent consideration is  
  
   14 

    Manning   Napier, Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

calculated on a quarterly basis by forecasting Rainier s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization ("EBITA") as defined by the purchase agreement over the contingency period with changes in the fair value included in other operating costs in the consolidated statements of operations. Significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation include adjusted EBITA growth of up to   63%   and an earn-out payment discount rate of   3.1%   over the contingency period.   
  The changes in financial assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are presented in the table below: 

The Company s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out of the valuation levels as of the beginning of the reporting period. There were no transfers between Levels during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Note 8 Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities 
  Accrued expenses and other liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following: 

Note 9 Borrowings 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  On April 23, 2015, Manning   Napier, Inc., Manning   Napier Group and MNA (collectively, the "Borrowers") entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, lender, swingline lender and issuing bank, Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, as syndication agent and lender, and First Niagara Bank, The Bank of New York Mellon, and The Huntington National Bank, as lenders (collectively, the "Lenders") that has a   four  -year term (until April 23, 2019) and provides borrowing capacity of up to   $100.0 million  , with a feature providing for an increase in the line to   $150.0 million   on approval by the Lenders. The Credit Agreement also provides for a   $5.0 million   sub-limit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a   $5.0 million   swingline facility. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement and the Company had the capacity to draw on the entire   $100.0 million   under the Credit Agreement.  
  Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the Company's option, either   LIBOR   (adjusted for reserves and not below   0.0%  ) for interest periods of one, two, three or six months or a base rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margins range from   1.50%   to   2.50%   in the case of LIBOR-based loans, and   0.50%   to   1.50%   in the case of base rate loans. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is also required to pay certain fees, including among other things a one-time initial commitment fee, and a quarterly fee based on the average unused amount of the facility ranging from   0.25%   to   0.45%  .  
  The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, including covenants that restrict (subject in certain instances to minimum thresholds or exceptions) the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, merge, dispose of assets, and make distributions, dividends, investments or capital expenditures, among other things. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including: (i) a minimum interest coverage ratio (generally, adjusted EBITDA to interest expense as defined in and for the period specified in the Credit Agreement) of at least   4.00  :1.00 and (ii) a leverage ratio (generally, total debt as of any date to adjusted EBITDA as defined in and for the period specified in the Credit Agreement) of no greater than   2.75  :1.00. For purposes of the Credit Agreement, adjusted EBITDA generally means, for any period, net income of the Company before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and  
  
   15 

    Manning   Napier, Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

amortization expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and certain non-cash nonrecurring gains and losses as described in and specified under the Credit Agreement. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
  The Credit Agreement also contains customary provisions regarding events of default which could result in an acceleration of amounts due under the facility. Such events of default include the Company's failure to pay principal or interest when due, the Company's failure to satisfy or comply with covenants and a change of control. 
   
  Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company may from time to time enter into agreements that contain certain representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications. The Company may also serve as a guarantor of such obligations of one or more of the Manning   Napier Group entities. The Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. The Company expects any risk of liability associated with such guarantees to be remote. 
  Regulation  
  As an investment adviser to a variety of investment products, the Company and its affiliated broker-dealer are subject to routine reviews and inspections by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., National Futures Association and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. From time to time, the Company may also be subject to claims, be involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business and be subject to other contingencies. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any of these reviews, inspections or other legal proceedings will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements; however, litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual litigated matters is difficult to predict. The Company will establish accruals for matters that are probable, can be reasonably estimated, and may take into account any related insurance recoveries to the extent of such recoveries. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company has not accrued for any such claims, legal proceedings, or other contingencies. 
   
  Note 11 Earnings per Common Share  
  Basic earnings per share ( basic EPS ) is computed using the two-class method to determine net income available to Class A common stock. The two-class method includes an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each participating security according to dividends declared and undistributed earnings for the period. The Company's restricted Class A common shares granted under the 2011 Equity Compensation Plan (the "Equity Plan") have non-forfeitable dividend rights during their vesting period and are therefore considered participating securities under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, the Company's net income available to Class A common stock is reduced by the amount allocated to the unvested restricted Class A common stock. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income available to Class A common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  
  Diluted earnings per share ( diluted EPS ) is computed under the more dilutive of either the treasury method or the two-class method. For the diluted calculation, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period is increased by the assumed conversion into Class A common stock of the unvested equity awards and the exchangeable units of Manning   Napier Group, to the extent that such conversion would dilute earnings per share. 
  
   16 

    Manning   Napier, Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The following is a reconciliation of the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   under the two-class method: 

The Company s Class B common stock represent voting interests and do not participate in the earnings of the Company. Accordingly, there is no basic or diluted EPS related to the Company s Class B common stock. 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   990,000   unvested equity awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.  
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   1,030,000   and   1,285,357  , respectively, unvested equity awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   181,378   unvested equity awards were also excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the performance conditions associated with the vesting of such awards had not yet been satisfied. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015   there were   65,784,571   and   67,896,484   Class A Units of Manning   Napier Group outstanding, respectively, which, subject to certain restrictions, may be exchangeable for up to an equivalent number of the Company's Class A common stock. These units were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
   
  Note 12 Equity Based Compensation  
  The Equity Plan was adopted by the Company's board of directors and approved by the Company's stockholders prior to the consummation of the IPO. A total of   13,142,813   equity interests are authorized for issuance. The equity interests may be issued in the form of the Company's Class A common stock, restricted stock units, units of Manning   Napier Group, or certain classes of membership interests in the Company which may convert into units of Manning   Napier Group. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   72,410   equity awards were granted under the Equity Plan. These awards consisted of Class A common stock that vested immediately. 
  
   17 

    Manning   Napier, Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

The following table summarizes the equity award activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   under the Company's Equity Plan: 

The weighted average grant date fair value of Equity Plan awards granted during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $8.38   and   $11.89  , respectively, based on the closing sale price of Manning   Napier Inc.'s Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, and, when applicable, reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the requisite service period. Restricted stock unit awards are not entitled to dividends declared on the underlying shares of Class A common stock until the awards vest. 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded approximately   $0.4 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively, of compensation expense related to awards under the Equity Plan. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded approximately   $1.2 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively of compensation expense related to awards under the Equity Plan. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was unrecognized compensation expense related to Equity Plan awards of approximately   $10.3 million  , which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of approximately   4.1 years  . 
   
  Note 13 Income Taxes 
  The Company is comprised of entities that have elected to be treated as either a limited liability company ("LLC") or a  C-Corporation". As such, the entities functioning as LLC s are not liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal and most state income taxes on their earnings, and earnings (losses) will be included in the personal income tax returns of each entity s unit holders. The entities functioning as C-Corporations are liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal and state and local income taxes on their earnings and losses, respectively. 
  The Company s income tax provision and effective tax rate were as follows:    

For the   three and nine months ended   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the difference between the Company s recorded provision and the provision that would result from applying the U.S. statutory rate of   35%   is primarily attributable to the benefit resulting from the fact that a significant portion of the Company s operations include a series of flow-through entities which are generally not subject to federal and most state income taxes. Accordingly, a portion of the Company s earnings are not subject to corporate level taxes. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company received an additional benefit of approximately   $3.2 million   resulting from the release of uncertain tax positions that increased the expected future tax benefits under the TRA. 
   
  Note 14 Related Party Transactions 
  Transactions with noncontrolling members 
  From time to time, the Company may be asked to provide certain services, including accounting, legal and other administrative functions for the noncontrolling members of Manning   Napier Group. While immaterial, the Company has not received any reimbursement for such services. 
  The Company manages the personal funds of certain of the Company's executive officers, including William Manning. Pursuant to the respective investment management agreements, in some instances the Company waives or reduces its regular  
  
   18

advisory fees for these accounts and personal funds utilized to incubate products. The aggregate value of the fees earned was approximately   $0.1 million   and fees waived was less than   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Affiliated fund transactions 
  The Company has agreements to serve as the investment manager of Manning   Napier Fund, Inc. and Rainier Investment Management Mutual Funds, with which certain of its officers are affiliated. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company receives a fee based on an annual percentage of the average daily net assets of each series within the affiliated funds. The Company has contractually agreed to limit its fees and reimburse expenses to limit operating expenses incurred by certain of the affiliated fund series. The investment management and operating expense agreements are generally reviewed and continued annually by the affiliated funds' boards of directors. 
   
  Note 15 Subsequent Events 
  Distributions and dividends 
  On   October 25, 2016  , the Board of Directors approved a distribution from Manning   Napier Group to Manning   Napier and the noncontrolling interests of Manning   Napier Group.

  Overview 
  Business 
  We are an independent investment management firm that provides a broad range of investment solutions, as well as a variety of consultative services that complement our investment process. Founded in 1970, we offer equity, fixed income, and alternative strategies, as well as a range of blended asset portfolios, such as life cycle funds. We serve a diversified client base of high net worth individuals and institutions, including 401(k) plans, pension plans, Taft-Hartley plans, endowments and foundations. Our operations are based principally in the United States, with our headquarters located in Fairport, New York. 
  Our Products 
  We derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management fees earned from providing advisory services to separately managed accounts and mutual funds and collective investment trusts including those offered by the Manning   Napier Fund, Inc. and Exeter Trust Company. In addition, on April 30, 2016, we acquired a majority interest in Rainier Investment Management, LLC ("Rainier"), an active investment management firm. With the acquisition of Rainier we expand our product offering to include capitalization-based U.S. and non-U.S. equity strategies. We also broaden our investment vehicles to include mutual funds and collective investment trusts offered by Rainier Investment Management Mutual Funds and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust. Based in Seattle, Washington, Rainier broadens our geographic presence in the Northwestern United States.  
  Our separate accounts are primarily distributed through our Direct Channel, where our representatives form relationships with high net worth individuals, middle market institutions or large institutions that are working with a consultant. To a lesser extent, we also obtain a portion of our separate account distribution via third parties, either through our Intermediary Channel where national brokerage firm representatives or independent financial advisors select our separate account strategies for their clients, or through our Platform/Sub-Advisory Channel, where unaffiliated registered investment advisors approve our strategies for their product platforms. Our separate account products are a primary driver of our blended asset portfolios for high net worth and middle market institutional clients and financial intermediaries. In contrast, larger institutions and unaffiliated registered investment advisor platforms are a driver of our separate account equity portfolios. 
  Our mutual funds and collective investment trusts are distributed through financial intermediaries, including brokers, financial advisors, retirement plan advisors and platform relationships. We also distribute our mutual fund and collective investment trusts through our direct sales representatives, in particular within the defined contribution and institutional marketplace. Our mutual fund and collective investment trust products are an important driver of our blended asset class portfolios, in particular with 401(k) plan sponsors, advisors and recordkeepers that select our funds as default options for participants. In addition, financial intermediaries, mutual fund advisory programs and retail platforms are a driver of equity strategies within our mutual fund offerings.

     Table of Contents  

Our assets under management ("AUM") was   $34.8 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . The composition of our AUM by vehicle and portfolio is illustrated in the table below: 

The composition of our separately managed accounts as of   September 30, 2016  , by channel and portfolio, is set forth in the table below: 

Our separate accounts contributed   34%   of our total gross client inflows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and represented   59%   of our total AUM as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Our separate account business has historically been driven primarily by our Direct Channel, where sales representatives form a relationship with high net worth investors, middle market institutions, and large institutional clients working in conjunction with a consultant. The Direct Channel contributed 64% of the total gross client inflows for our separate account business for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and represented   76%   of our total separate account AUM as of   September 30, 2016  . We anticipate the Direct Channel to continue to be the largest driver of new separate account business going forward, given the Direct Channel s high net worth and middle market institutional client-type focus. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , blended asset portfolios represented 71% of the separate account gross client inflows from the Direct Channel, while equity and fixed income portfolios represented 12% and 17% respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , blended asset and equity portfolios represented   55%   and   38%  , respectively, of total Direct Channel separate account AUM, while our fixed income portfolios were   7%  . We expect our focus on individuals and middle market institutions to continue to drive interest in our blended asset class portfolios, where we provide a comprehensive portfolio of stocks and bonds managed to a client s specific investment objectives. Our relationships with larger institutions may also be a driver of growth in separately managed account equity strategies, though many of these larger institutions may seek exposure to  
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

non-U.S. equity strategies through commingled vehicles rather than separately managed accounts to limit related custody expenses. 
  To a lesser extent, we also obtain separate account business from third parties, including financial advisors or unaffiliated registered investment advisor programs or platforms. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , 15% of the total gross client inflows for separate accounts came from financial advisor representatives (Intermediary Channel), and an additional 21% came from registered investment advisor platforms (Platform/Sub-advisor Channel). The Intermediary and Platform/Sub-advisor Channels represented   24%   of our total separate account AUM as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  New separate account business through the Intermediary Channel flowed into both our blended asset and equity portfolios, driven by advisors  needs to identify either a one-stop solution (blended asset portfolio) or to fill a mandate within a multi-strategy portfolio. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , blended asset and equity portfolios represented 69% and 24%, respectively, of the separate account gross client inflows from the Intermediary Channel, while fixed income portfolios represented 7%. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   80%   of our separate account AUM derived from financial advisors was allocated to blended asset portfolios, with   17%   allocated to equity and   3%   allocated to fixed income. We expect that equity and fixed income portfolios may see additional interest from financial advisors over time as more advisors structure a multi-strategy portfolio for their clients. 
  In contrast, gross client inflows through the Platform/Sub-advisor Channel are primarily directed to our equity strategies,     where we are filling a specific mandate within the investment program or platform product. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , 100% of our separate account gross client inflows from the Platform/Sub-advisory Channel were into equity portfolios.  
  Our annualized separate account retention rate across all channels was approximately 86% during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , representing the strong relationship focus that is inherent in our direct sales model, which is the primary driver of our separate account business. 
  The composition of our mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM as of   September 30, 2016  , by portfolio, is set forth in the table below: 

Our mutual funds and collective investment trusts contributed   66%   of our total gross client inflows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and represented   41%   of our total AUM as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , our mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM consisted of   68%   from blended asset portfolios and   31%   from equity portfolios. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , 78% and 20% of the gross client inflows were attributable to blended assets and equity portfolios, respectively.  
  Our mutual fund and collective investment trust business is driven by financial intermediaries and to a lesser extent, our direct sales representatives. Intermediary distribution of our mutual fund and collective investment trust vehicles is achieved via financial advisors, brokers and retirement plan advisors. Through our Intermediary Channel, we are focused on our blended asset life cycle fund vehicles given our emphasis on advisors who work with retirement plans. Our blended asset portfolios are also used by advisors seeking a multi-asset class solution for their retail clients. In addition, we are focused on equity and fixed income portfolios within the Intermediary Channel for intermediaries who wish to use our mutual funds as a component of a larger portfolio. 
  Through our Platform/Sub-advisor Channel, we have relationships with consultants and manager research teams at platforms. We are focused on equity and fixed income portfolio assets in this channel through the selection of our funds within advisory programs, or through placement on platforms  approved lists of funds. To facilitate our relationships with intermediaries, we currently have approximately 290 dealer relationships. These relationships are important to our retail business as well as our 401(k) life cycle and institutional business. 
  Our Direct Sales Representatives distribute our equity portfolios to large institutional clients with which we have direct relationships and often, the client s consultant. Through the Direct Channel, we also form relationships with middle market and large market defined contribution plan sponsors seeking to use our life cycle mutual funds and collective investment trusts as default options on their investment menu. We expect this channel to focus on distributing blended asset and equity portfolio funds in the future.

Results of Operations 
  Below is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  Components of Results of Operations 
  Overview    
  Changes to our operating results over time are largely driven by net client asset flows and changes to the market value of our AUM. The line item "market appreciation/(depreciation) and other" within our AUM tables throughout "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" includes investment gains/(losses) on AUM, net flows from non-sales related activities including net reinvested dividends. 
  An important factor influencing inflows and outflows of our AUM is the investment performance of our various investment approaches. Our variety of stock selection strategies, absolute pricing discipline and active asset allocation management approach generally results in specific absolute and relative return characteristics in different market environments. For example, during a fundamental-driven bull market when prices are rising alongside improving fundamentals, we are likely to experience positive absolute returns and competitive relative returns. However, in a more momentum-driven bull market, when prices become disconnected from underlying fundamentals, or narrow market environment where a small handful of stocks outperform the average stock, we are likely to experience positive absolute returns but lagging relative returns. Similarly, during a valuation-driven bear market, when markets experience a period of price correction following a momentum-driven bull market, we are likely to experience negative absolute returns but strong relative returns. However, in a momentum-driven bear market, which is typically characterized by broad price declines in a highly correlated market, we are likely to experience negative absolute returns and potentially lagging relative returns. Essentially, our approach is likely to do well when markets are driven by fundamentals, but lag when markets are driven primarily by momentum. 
  Other components impacting our operating results include: 
             
    asset-based fee rates and changes in those rates; 
                
    the composition of our AUM among various portfolios, vehicles and client types;  
                
    changes in our variable costs, including incentive compensation and distribution, servicing and custody expenses, which are affected by our investment performance, level of our AUM and revenue; and 
                
    fixed costs, including changes to base compensation, vendor-related costs and investment spending on new products.

The following table summarizes the annualized returns for our key investment strategies and the relative performance of the industry benchmark over the periods indicated. Since inception and over long-term periods, these strategies have earned attractive returns on both an absolute and relative basis. These strategies are used across separate account, mutual fund and collective investment trust vehicles, and represent approximately   75%   of our AUM as of   September 30, 2016  .

    Key investment strategy returns are presented net of fees. Benchmark returns do not reflect any fees or expenses. 
       
  Revenue    
  Our revenues primarily consist of investment management fees earned from managing our clients  AUM. We earn our investment management fees as a percentage of our clients  AUM either as of a specified date or on a daily basis. Our investment management fees can fluctuate based on the average fee rate for our investment management products, which are affected by the composition of our AUM among various portfolios and investment vehicles.  
  The Company serves as the investment adviser for Manning   Napier Fund, Inc. series of mutual funds, Rainier Investment Management Mutual Funds, Exeter Trust Company Collective Investment Trusts and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust. The funds are open-end mutual funds that primarily offer no-load share classes designed to meet the needs of a range of institutional and other investors. Exeter Trust Company, an affiliated New Hampshire-chartered trust company and Rainier Multiple Investment Trust sponsor collective investment trusts for qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans. These mutual funds and collective investment trusts comprised   $14.3 billion  , or   41%  , of our AUM as of   September 30, 2016  , and investment management fees from these mutual funds and collective investment trusts were   $28.0 million  , or   44%   of our  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . MNA and Rainier also serve as the investment advisor to all of our separately managed accounts, managing   $20.5 billion  , or   59%  , of our AUM as of   September 30, 2016  , including assets managed as a sub-advisor to pooled investment vehicles and assets in client accounts invested in the Fund. 
  Operating Expenses    
  Our largest operating expenses are employee compensation and distribution, servicing and custody expenses, discussed further below, with a significant portion of these expenses varying in a direct relationship to our absolute and relative investment management performance, as well as AUM and revenues. We review our operating expenses in relation to the investment market environment and changes in our revenues. However, we are generally willing to make expenditures as necessary even when faced with declining rates of growth in revenues in order to support our investment products, our client service levels, strategic initiatives and our long-term value. 
             
    Compensation and related costs  . Employee compensation and related costs represent our largest expense, including employee salaries and benefits, incentive compensation to investment and sales professionals and equity-based compensation issued under our equity compensation plan. These costs are affected by changes in the employee headcount, the mix of existing job descriptions, competitive factors, the addition of new skill sets, variations in the level of our AUM and revenues, changes in our stock price reflected in share-based compensation and/or the number of awards issued. In addition, incentive compensation for our research team considers the cumulative impact of both absolute and relative investment performance over the trailing one-, two- and three-year time periods, with more weight placed on the recent periods. As such, incentive compensation paid to our research team will vary based on absolute and relative investment performance.  
                
    Distribution, servicing and custody expenses  . Distribution, servicing and custody expense represent amounts paid to various platforms that distribute our mutual funds and collective trust funds, as well as costs for custodial services, shareholder services, and 12b-1 distribution. These expenses generally increase or decrease in line with changes in our mutual fund and collective investment trust AUM or services performed by these intermediaries. 
                
    Other operating costs  . Other operating costs include accounting and legal and other professional service fees, occupancy and facility costs, travel and entertainment expenses, insurance, market data service expenses and all other miscellaneous costs associated with managing the day-to-day operations of our business. 
     Non-Operating Income (Loss)    
  Non-operating income (loss) includes interest expense, interest and dividend income, changes in liability under the tax receivable agreement ("TRA") entered into between Manning   Napier and the other holders of Class A Units of Manning   Napier Group, gains (losses) related to investment securities sales and changes in values of those investment securities designated as trading. Interest expense primarily relates to unused commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs. We expect the interest and investment components of non-operating income (loss) to fluctuate based on market conditions, the performance of our investments and the overall amount of our investments held by the Company to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes as well as the timing and amounts (if any) outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. 
  Provision for Income Taxes    
  The Company is comprised of entities that have elected to be treated as either a limited liability company ("LLC") or a "C-Corporation". As such, the entities functioning as LLC's are not liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal or most state and local income taxes on their earnings, and their earnings (losses) will be included in the personal income tax returns of each entity's unit holders. The entities functioning as C-Corporations are liable for or able to benefit from U.S. federal and state and local income taxes on their earnings and losses, respectively. 
  Noncontrolling Interests  
  Manning   Napier, Inc. holds an economic interest of approximately   17.4%   in Manning   Napier Group as of   September 30, 2016   but, as managing member, controls all of the business and affairs of Manning   Napier Group. As a result, the Company consolidates the financial results of Manning   Napier Group and records a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations represents the portion of earnings attributable to the economic interest in Manning   Napier Group held by the noncontrolling interests.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  . 
  In the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company revised its treatment of payments made to certain advisory clients, in accordance with ASC 605-50,   Revenue Recognition - Customer Payments and Incentives   to properly present these payments as a reduction to revenue. The Company assessed the materiality of this item on its fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and all prior and subsequent periods, and concluded that the reclassification was not material to any such periods. The statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 included herein have been revised to reflect the proper presentation of investment management services revenue and distribution, servicing and custody expenses. The reclassification has no impact on operating income or net income. Average fees and expenses presented as a percentage of revenue throughout "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" have been revised to reflect the reclassification. See Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Basis of Presentation" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
  This management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015   together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the other financial information that appear elsewhere in this report. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Because the majority of our revenues are earned based on AUM that has been determined using fair value methods and since market appreciation/depreciation has a significant impact on our revenue, we have presented our AUM using the U.S. GAAP ("GAAP") framework for measuring fair value. A fair value hierarchy is provided that gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following three-tier fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value: 
  Level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; 
  Level 2 other significant observable inputs (including but not limited to quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment rates, credit risk, etc.); and 
  Level 3 significant unobservable inputs (including the Company s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments). 
  The table below summarizes the approximate amount of AUM for the periods indicated for which fair value is measured based on Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.    

As substantially all our AUM is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs, we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our AUM, as discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  and in  Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

    Percentage change not meaningful 
     The total AUM decrease of   $0.9 billion  , or   3%  , to   $34.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $35.7 billion   at   June 30, 2016   was attributable to net client cash outflows of   $2.3 billion  , partially offset by market appreciation of   $1.4 billion  . Our separate accounts and mutual fund and collective investment trust vehicles had net client outflows of approximately   $0.9 billion   and   $1.4 billion  , respectively. The blended investment gain was   4%   in separately managed accounts and   4%   in mutual funds and collective investment trusts. We experienced a decline in the volume of gross client outflows and gross client inflows during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015. Our gross client outflows decreased by   24%   from   $4.4 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $3.4 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , while our gross client inflows decreased by   38%  . We believe the decline in gross client outflows is the result of improved short term performance and servicing efforts to stabilize client relationships. By portfolio, our AUM decreased by   $684.1 million  , or   6%  , in our equity portfolio,   $127.9 million  , or   1%  , in our blended asset portfolio and   $85.7 million  , or   6%  , in our fixed income portfolio. Our ability to improve cash flows going forward will likely depend in part on our ability to sustain the recently improved performance in future quarters, thus improving our one, three and five year track record across our key strategies. 
  Our total AUM decreased by   $2.4 billion   from   $37.2 billion   at   September 30, 2015   to   $34.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was attributable to net client outflows of   $9.0 billion  , partially offset by market appreciation of   $3.7 billion   and acquired assets of   $2.9 billion  . Net client outflows consisted of approximately   $4.3 billion   of net outflows for separate accounts and   $4.7 billion   for mutual funds and collective investment trusts. The rates of change in AUM were most significant in our equity portfolios from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  , with a decrease of   $1.3 billion  , or   10%  , while our blended asset portfolio decreased by   $1.2 billion  , or   5%  , and our fixed income portfolio increased by   $131.2 million  , or   11%  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the composition of our AUM was   59%   in separate accounts and   41%   in mutual funds and collective investment trusts, compared to   58%   in separate accounts and   42%   in mutual funds and collective investment trusts at   September 30, 2015  . The composition of our AUM across portfolios at   September 30, 2016   was   62%   in blended assets,   34%   in equity, and   4%   in fixed income, compared to   61%   in blended assets,   36%   in equity, and   3%   in fixed income at   September 30, 2015  .

With regard to our separate accounts, gross client inflows of   $0.4 billion   were offset by approximately   $1.2 billion   of gross client outflows during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The   $0.4 billion   gross client inflows include approximately $0.2 billion into our blended asset portfolio and $0.1 billion into our equity portfolio. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , 68% of our separate account gross client inflows were derived from our Direct Channel with 44% representing contributions from existing Direct Channel relationships. With regard to gross client outflows, cancellations were approximately $0.8 billion and withdrawals from existing accounts were approximately $0.4 billion. Outflows during the third quarter were concentrated in our equity portfolios where 62% of outflows occurred. In light of challenging relative returns during the latter half of 2014 and 2015, our separate account clients redeemed assets at a rate of 36% during the quarter, compared to a 28% redemption rate over the trailing twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  . The annualized separate account retention rate was 85% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 84% for the rolling twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Net client outflows of   $1.4 billion   from our mutual fund and collective investment trusts included gross client inflows of   $0.8 billion  , offset by gross client outflows of   $2.2 billion   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Gross client inflows into our blended asset life cycle vehicles, including both risk based and target date strategies, represented $0.5 billion, or 68%, of mutual fund and collective trust fund gross client inflows during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . With regard to gross client outflows, $1.3 billion, or 59%, of mutual fund and collective investment trust gross client outflows were from blended asset mutual fund and collective trust products. The remaining net cash flow was concentrated in our Non U.S. Equity products including our World Opportunities Series and Overseas Series.

     Revenues 
  Our investment management services revenue   decreased   by   $12.1 million  , or   16%  , to   $63.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $75.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This decrease is driven primarily by a   $4.8 billion  , or   12%  , decrease in our average AUM to   $35.4 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $40.2 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Average AUM decreased as a result of net client outflows of   $9.0 billion  , partially offset by market appreciation of   $3.7 billion   and acquired assets of   $2.9 billion   during the rolling twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  . By portfolio, our AUM decreases were concentrated in our equity portfolios,

which decreased by   10%   compared to   September 30, 2015  . The outflows were largely attributable to challenging portfolio performance relative to benchmarks.  
  Our average separately managed account fee for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased slightly to   0.62%   compared to   0.64%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, separately managed account standard fees ranged from 0.15% to 1.25% depending on investment objective and account size. As of   September 30, 2016  , the concentration of assets in our separately managed accounts was   58%   blended assets,   36%   equity and   6%   fixed income, compared to   57%   blended assets,   37%   equity and   6%   fixed income as of   September 30, 2015  .  
  Our average fee on mutual fund and collective investment trust products decreased to   0.77%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.81%   for   2015  . This decrease was primarily due to a shift in the mix of our AUM from higher fee mutual funds and collective trusts to those with lower fees. The management fees earned on our mutual fund and collective investment trust management fees ranged from 0.24% to 1.00%, depending on investment strategy, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the concentration of assets in our mutual fund and collective investment trusts was   68%   blended assets,   31%   equity and   1%   fixed income, compared to   68%   blended assets and   32%   equity of   September 30, 2015  .  
  Operating Expenses 
  Our operating expenses   decreased   by   $3.1 million  , or   7%  , to   $41.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $44.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Compensation and related costs   increased   by   $0.1 million  , or   1%  , to   $24.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $24.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was due to higher variable incentive costs for our investment team resulting from investment performance, partially offset by lower overall workforce. When considered as a percentage of revenue, compensation and related costs for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   39%   compared to   32%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Distribution, servicing and custody expenses   decreased   by   $2.3 million  , or   21%  , to   $8.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $11.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was generally driven by a   14%   decrease in mutual funds and collective investment trusts average AUM for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of mutual fund and collective investment trust revenue, distribution, servicing and custody expense was   31%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   32%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Other operating costs for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $8.2 million  , compared to   $9.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of revenue, other operating costs for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   13%   compared to   12%   for   2015  . 
  Non-Operating Income (Loss) 
  Non-operating loss for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.1 million  , compared to a net loss of   $6.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Included within non-operating income (loss) for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $0.1 million   and   $3.2 million   of net losses, respectively, on investments held by the Company to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes. Interest expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was approximately   $0.1 million   driven primarily by the unused commitment fee on our credit facility. In addition, we recognized   $2.8 million   of non-operating expense in the third quarter of 2015 resulting from the release of uncertain tax positions that increased our expectation of future tax benefits under the TRA and the corresponding payment of such benefits under the agreement.  
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The Company s tax provision decreased by   $3.2 million   to   $1.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from a benefit of   $1.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily driven by a benefit of $3.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015 resulting from the release of uncertain tax positions that increased our expectation of future tax benefits under the TRA.

Included in net client flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were net client outflows in separately managed accounts of approximately   $2.9 billion   and mutual funds and collective investment trusts of approximately   $3.2 billion  . The blended investment gain was   7.0%   in separately managed accounts and   7.3%   in mutual funds and collective investment trusts. We experienced a decline in the volume of gross client outflows and gross client inflows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to 2015. Gross client outflows decreased   26%   from   $13.4 billion   for   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $9.9 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , while gross client inflows decreased by   28%  . We believe the decline in gross client outflows is the result of improved short term performance and servicing efforts to stabilize client relationships. By portfolio, our net   $0.6 billion   AUM decrease was derived from an increase of   $96.4 million  , or   1%  , in our equity portfolio,   $173.4 million  , or   15%  , in our fixed income portfolio offset by a decrease of   $893.5 million  , or   4%  , in our blended asset portfolio. Our ability to improve cash flows going forward will likely depend in part on our ability to sustain the recently improved performance in future quarters, thus improving our one, three and five year track record across our key strategies. 
  Our total AUM decreased by   $2.4 billion   from   $37.2 billion   at   September 30, 2015   to   $34.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was attributable to net client outflows of   $9.0 billion  , partially offset by market appreciation of   $3.7 billion   and acquired assets of   $2.9 billion  . Net client outflows consisted of approximately   $4.3 billion   of net outflows for separate accounts and   $4.7 billion   for mutual funds and collective investment trusts. The rates of change in AUM were most significant in our equity portfolios from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  , with a decrease of   $1.3 billion  , or   10%  , while our blended asset portfolio decreased by   $1.2 billion  , or   5%  , and our fixed income portfolio increased by   11%  .

As of   September 30, 2016  , the composition of our AUM was   59%   in separate accounts and   41%   in mutual funds and collective investment trusts, compared to   58%   in separate accounts and   42%   in mutual funds and collective investment trusts at   September 30, 2015  . The composition of our AUM across portfolios at   September 30, 2016   was   62%   in blended assets,   34%   in equity, and   4%   in fixed income, compared to   61%   in blended assets,   36%   in equity, and   3%   in fixed income at   September 30, 2015  . 
  With regard to our separate accounts, gross client inflows of   $1.3 billion   were offset by approximately   $4.2 billion   of gross client outflows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The   $1.3 billion   of gross client inflows included $0.6 billion into our blended asset portfolios and $0.5 billion into our equity portfolios. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , 64% of our separate account gross client inflows were derived from our Direct Channel with 44% representing contributions from existing Direct Channel relationships. Gross client outflows were split with 45% withdrawals from existing accounts and 55% representing client cancellations. Our blended asset and equity portfolios experienced net client outflows of approximately $1.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. In light of challenging relative returns during the latter half of 2014 and 2015, our separate account clients redeemed assets at a rate of 30% during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a 28% redemption rate over the trailing twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  . The annualized separate account retention rate was 86% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   up slightly from 84% for the rolling twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Net client outflows of   $3.2 billion   from our mutual fund and collective investment trusts included gross client inflows of   $2.5 billion   offset by gross client outflows of   $5.7 billion   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Gross client inflows into our blended asset life cycle vehicles, including both risk based and target date strategies, represented $2.0 billion, or 78%, of mutual fund and collective trust fund gross client inflows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . With regard to gross client outflows, $3.4 billion, or 60%, of mutual fund and collective investment trust gross client outflows were from blended asset mutual fund and collective trust products. The remaining net cash flow was concentrated in our Non U.S. Equity products including our World Opportunities Series and Overseas Series.

     Revenues 
  Our investment management services revenue   decreased   by   $58.2 million  , or   23%  , to   $189.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $248.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This   decrease   was driven primarily by a   $8.8 billion  , or   20%  , decrease in our average AUM to   $35.3 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $44.1 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Average AUM decreased as a result of net client outflows of   $9.0 billion   offset by market appreciation and other changes of   $3.7 billion   and acquired assets of $2.9 billion during the rolling twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  . By portfolio, our equity and blended asset portfolios decreased by   9.6%   and   5.4%  , respectively, compared to   September 30, 2015  . The outflows were largely attributable to challenging portfolio performance relative to benchmarks.

Our average separately managed account fee remained consistent at   0.62%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   0.63%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . For both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , separately managed account management fees ranged from 0.15% to 1.25%, depending on investment objective and account size. As of   September 30, 2016  , the concentration of assets in our separately managed accounts was   58%   blended assets,   36%   equity and   6%   fixed income, compared to   57%   blended assets,   37%   equity and   6%   fixed income as of   September 30, 2015  .  
  Our average fee on mutual fund and collective investment trust products was   0.78%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , a decrease from   0.82%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to a shift in the mix of our AUM from higher fee mutual funds and collective investment trusts to those with lower fees. For both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , mutual fund and collective investment trust management fees ranged from 0.24% to 1.00%, depending on investment strategy. As of   September 30, 2016   the concentration of assets in our mutual fund and collective investment trusts was   68%   blended assets,   31%   equity and   1%   fixed income, compared to   68%   blended assets and   32%   equity of   September 30, 2015  .  
  Operating Expenses 
  Our operating expenses   decreased   by   $23.3 million  , or   16%  , to   $122.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $145.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Compensation and related costs   decreased   by   $8.7 million  , or   11%  , to   $71.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $79.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was due to a lower overall workforce coupled with lower variable incentive costs. When considered as a percentage of revenue, compensation and related costs for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   37%   compared to   32%   in   2015  . 
  Distribution, servicing and custody expenses   decreased   by   $12.4 million  , or   32%  , to   $26.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $39.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   was generally attributable to a   25%   decrease in mutual funds and collective investment trusts average AUM for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of mutual fund and collective investment trust revenue, distribution, servicing and custody expenses was   32%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   32%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Other operating costs   decreased   by   $2.2 million  , or   8%  , to   $24.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $27.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of revenue, other operating costs for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   13%   compared to   11%   for   2015  . 
  Non-Operating Income (Loss) 
  Non-operating income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $1.2 million  , compared to non-operating loss of   $6.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Included in non-operating income (loss) was a net gain of   $1.2 million   on investments held by the Company to provide initial cash seeding for product development purposes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a net loss of   $4.2 million   in   2015  . Interest expense was approximately   $0.3 million   and   $0.2 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, driven primarily by the unused commitment fee on our credit facility entered into during 2015. In addition, we recognized   $2.8 million   of non-operating expense in the third quarter of 2015 resulting from the release of uncertain tax positions that increased our expectation of future tax benefits under the TRA and the corresponding payment of such benefits under the agreement.  
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The Company s tax provision   increased   by   $1.8 million  , or   62%  , to   $4.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $3.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily driven by a decrease in expected taxable earnings as compared to the prior year as well as a benefit of $3.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulting from the release of uncertain tax positions that increased our expectation of future tax benefits under the TRA. 

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information 
  To provide investors with greater insight, promote transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, we supplement our consolidated statements of operations presented on a GAAP basis with non-GAAP financial measures of earnings. 
  Management uses economic net income and economic net income per adjusted share as financial measures to evaluate the profitability and efficiency of its business. Economic net income and economic net income per adjusted share are not presented in accordance with GAAP. 
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

Economic net income is a non-GAAP measure of after-tax operating performance and equals the Company s income before provision for income taxes less adjusted income taxes. Adjusted income taxes are estimated assuming the exchange of all outstanding units of Manning   Napier Group into Class A common stock on a one-to-one basis. Therefore, all income of Manning   Napier Group allocated to the units of Manning   Napier Group is treated as if it were allocated to the Company and represents an estimate of income tax expense at an effective rate of 38% and 30% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and 38% and 35% for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, reflecting assumed federal, state and local income taxes. Economic net income per adjusted share is equal to economic net income divided by the weighted average adjusted Class A common shares outstanding. The number of weighted average adjusted Class A common shares outstanding for all periods presented is determined by assuming the weighted average exchangeable units of Manning   Napier Group and unvested equity awards are converted into our outstanding Class A common stock as of the respective reporting date, on a one-to-one basis. The Company s management uses economic net income, among other financial data, to determine the earnings available to distribute as dividends to holders of its Class A common stock and to the holders of the units of Manning   Napier Group. 
  Non-GAAP measures are not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, the Company s non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Historically, our cash and liquidity needs have been met primarily through cash generated by our operations. Our current financial condition is highly liquid, with a significant amount of our assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and investment securities held by us for the purpose of providing initial cash seeding for product development purposes.  
  The following table sets forth certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :  

________________________ 
           (1) 
    In light of numerous factors affecting our obligation to make such payments, the timing and amounts of any such actual payments are based on our best estimate as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , including our ability to realize the expected tax benefits. Actual payments may significantly differ from estimated payments. 
              (2) 
    Represents the   September 30, 2016   fair value of additional cash payments related to our acquisition of Rainier of up to $32.5 million over a four year period, contingent upon Rainier's achievement of certain financial targets. Significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation include adjusted EBITA growth of up to 63% and an earn-out payment discount rate of 3.1% over the contingency period. The change in fair value of this liability during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was a decrease of $0.5 million, which is included in other operating costs in the consolidated statements of operations. 
     In determining the sufficiency of liquidity and capital resources to fund our business, we regularly monitor our liquidity position, including among other things, cash, working capital, long-term liabilities, lease commitments and operating company distributions.  
  Our revolving credit agreement has a four-year term expiring in April 2019 and provides borrowing capacity of up to $  100.0 million  , with a feature providing for an increase in the line to   $150.0 million   on approval by the lending group. The Credit Agreement also provides for a   $5.0 million   sub-limit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a   $5.0 million   swingline facility. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement and the Company had the capacity to draw on the entire   $100.0 million  .  
  Amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at our option, either   LIBOR   (adjusted for reserves and not below 0.0%) for interest periods of one, two, three or six months or a base rate (as defined in the agreement), plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margins range from   1.50%   to   2.50%   in the case of LIBOR-based loans, and   0.50%   to   1.50%   in the case of base rate loans. Under the terms of the revolving credit agreement, we are also required to pay certain fees including a quarterly fee based on the average unused amount of the facility ranging from   0.25%   to   0.45%  .  
  The revolving credit agreement contains customary covenants, including covenants that restrict (subject in certain instances to minimum thresholds or exceptions) the ability of us to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, merge, sell or dispose of assets, and make distributions, dividends, investments or capital expenditures, among other things. 
   In addition, we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants, including: (i) a minimum interest coverage ratio (generally, adjusted EBITDA to interest expense as defined in and for the period specified in the revolving credit agreement) of at least   4.00  :1.00 and (ii) a leverage ratio (generally, total debt as of any date to adjusted EBITDA as defined in and for the period specified in the revolving credit agreement) of no greater than   2.75  :1.00. For purposes of the revolving credit agreement, adjusted EBITDA generally means, for any period, net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and certain non-cash nonrecurring gains and losses as

described in and specified under the revolving credit agreement. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. 
  The revolving credit agreement also contains customary provisions regarding events of default which could result in an acceleration of amounts due under the facility. Such events of default include our failure to pay principal or interest when due, our failure to satisfy or comply with covenants and a change of control. See Note 9, "Borrowings" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.  
  We believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient over the next twelve months to meet our working capital requirements. Further, we expect that cash on hand, cash generated by operations and availability under our revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.  

Cash Flows 
  The following table sets forth our cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Operating activities consist primarily of net income subject to adjustments for changes in operating assets and liabilities, equity-based compensation expense, changes in the liability under the TRA, deferred income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. Investing activities consist primarily of the purchase and sale of investments for the purpose of providing initial cash seeding for product development purposes, purchases of property and equipment and the acquisition of Rainier Investment Management, LLC during 2016. Financing activities consist primarily of distributions to noncontrolling interests, dividends paid on our Class A common stock, and purchases of Class A units held by noncontrolling interests of Manning   Napier Group.    

Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  Operating Activities 
  Operating activities provided   $65.4 million   and   $93.6 million   of net cash for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. This overall   $28.2 million     decrease   in net cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   2015   was due to a decrease in net income after adjustment for non-cash items of approximately   $35.3 million   driven by lower revenues resulting primarily from changes in our average AUM. This decrease was partially offset by   $9.9 million   of cash from consolidated funds due to the timing of trading activity.  
  Investing Activities 
  Investing activities used   $0.7 million   and provided   $1.0 million   of net cash for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven by cash used of   $9.3 million  , net of cash received, for the acquisition of Rainier. This increase in cash used was partially offset by changes in investing activities of   $7.2 million   due to the Company's funding of and timing of activity within our investment securities designated as trading for the seeding of new products, and by a decrease in property and equipment purchases of   $0.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   2015  . 
  Financing Activities 
  Financing activities used   $58.5 million   and   $125.5 million   of net cash for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. This overall   $66.9 million     decrease   in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a reduction in distributions to noncontrolling interests of   $44.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   2015   due to lower income after adjustment for non-cash items in 2016 and the timing of distributions. This decrease in cash used in financing activities was also driven by a decrease of   $21.6 million   of cash used for the purchase of Class A units of Manning   Napier pursuant to the exchange agreement entered into at the time of the Company's initial public offering of   $16.1 million   in 2016, compared to   $37.7 million   in 2015.     This decrease was due to a lower exchange price and a lower number of units exchanged in 2016.     In addition, payment of shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding increased by   $0.9 million   in 2016 due to the timing and amount of restricted share units vesting during the period.

Dividends 
  On November 2, 2015, the Board of Directors declared a $0.16 per share dividend to the holders of Class A common stock. The dividend was paid on February 1, 2016 to shareholders of record as of January 15, 2016. 
  On March 1, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a $0.16 per share dividend to the holders of Class A common stock. The dividend was paid on May 2, 2016 to shareholders of record as of April 15, 2016. 
  On April 26, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a $0.16 per share dividend to the holders of Class A common stock. The dividend was paid on August 1, 2016 to shareholders of record as of July 15, 2016. 
  On July 26, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a $0.16 per share dividend to the holders of Class A common stock. The dividend was paid on November 1, 2016 to shareholders of record as of October 14, 2016. 
  On October 25, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a $0.16 per share dividend to the holders of Class A common stock. The dividend is payable on or about February 1, 2017 to shareholders of record as of January 13, 2017. 
  We currently intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our Class A common stock. We intend to fund such dividends from our portion of distributions made by Manning   Napier Group, from its available cash generated from operations. William Manning, as the holder of our Class B common stock, will not be entitled to any cash dividends in his capacity as a Class B stockholder, but will, in his capacity as an indirect holder of Class A units of Manning   Napier Group, generally participate on a pro rata basis in distributions by Manning   Napier Group. 
  The declaration and payment of all future dividends, if any, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. In determining the amount of any future dividends, our board of directors will take into account: 
             
    the financial results of Manning   Napier Group; 
                
    our available cash, as well as anticipated cash requirements, including any debt servicing and payments required under the TRA; 
                
    our capital requirements and the capital requirements of our subsidiaries, including Manning   Napier Group; 
                
    contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions on, and implications of, the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or distributions by Manning   Napier Group to us, including the obligation of Manning   Napier Group to make tax distributions to its unitholders, including us; 
                
    general economic and business conditions; and 
                
    any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. 
     We have no material assets other than our ownership of Class A units of Manning   Napier Group and, accordingly, will depend on distributions from Manning   Napier Group to fund any dividends we may pay. As managing member of Manning   Napier Group, we will determine the timing and amount of any distributions to be paid to its members, other than mandatory tax distributions required under Manning   Napier Group's operating agreement. We intend to cause Manning   Napier Group to distribute cash to its members, including us, in an amount sufficient to cover dividends, if any, declared by us. If we do cause Manning   Napier Group to make such distributions, M N Group Holdings, MNCC and any other holders of units of Manning   Napier Group will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions on a pari passu basis. 
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  . 
   
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
  Market Risk 
  Our exposure to market risk is directly related to the role of our operating company as an investment advisor for the mutual funds and separate accounts it manages. Substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements with these funds and accounts. Under these agreements, the investment management fees we receive are based on the value of our AUM and our fee rates. Accordingly, our revenues and net income may decline as a result of our AUM decreasing due to depreciation of our investment portfolios. In addition, such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk, which would cause our revenues to decline further. 
  
   40 

     Table of Contents  

The value of our AUM was   $34.8 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . Assuming a 10% increase or decrease in the value of our AUM and the change being proportionally distributed over all our products, the value would increase or decrease by approximately   $3.5 billion  , which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately   $24.7 million   at our current weighted average fee rate of   0.71%  . 
  We have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy regarding client assets, nor have we attempted to hedge at the corporate level the market risks that would affect the value of our overall AUM and related revenues. Some of these risks (e.g., sector risks and currency risks) are inherent in certain strategies, and clients may invest in particular strategies to gain exposure to these risks. 
  We also are subject to market risk from a decline in the prices of investment securities that we own. These securities consist primarily of equity securities, fixed-income securities, investments in mutual funds, including the Fund for which MNA provides advisory services. The value of these investments was   $18.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   of which   $16.5 million   is investment securities classified as trading, and   $2.1 million   is investment securities classified as available-for-sale. Management regularly monitors the value of these investments; however, given their nature and relative size, we have not adopted a specific risk management policy to manage the associated market risk. Assuming a 10% increase or decrease in the values of these investment securities, the fair value would increase or decrease by approximately   $1.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Due to the nature of our business, we believe that we do not face any material risk from inflation. 
  Exchange Rate Risk 
  A substantial portion of the accounts that we advise, or sub-advise, hold investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Movements in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the underlying foreign currency affect the values of assets held in accounts we manage, thereby affecting the amount of revenues we earn. The value of the assets we manage was   $34.8 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   17%   of our AUM across our investment strategies was invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent our AUM are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the value of those AUM would decrease, with an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar, or increase, with a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar. 
  We monitor our exposure to exchange rate risk and make decisions on how to manage such risk accordingly; however, we have not adopted a corporate-level risk management policy to manage exchange rate risk. Assuming that   17%   of our AUM is invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and excluding the impact of any hedging arrangements, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would increase or decrease the fair value of our AUM by approximately   $0.6 billion  , which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately   $4.1 million   at our current weighted average fee rate of   0.71%  . 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company was exposed to interest-rate risk primarily due to our AUM that is invested in debt securities, as well as corporate assets that are invested in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates and estimated the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments. Management determined there was no material impact as of   September 30, 2016  . Additionally, given the current level of income we earn from our cash and cash equivalent balances, interest rate changes would not have a material impact on us. 
  Borrowing under our revolving credit agreement bears interest as described under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources". Interest rate changes may affect the amount of our interest payments in connection with our revolving credit agreement, and thereby affect future earnings and cash flows. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016   pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  On April 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Rainier Investment Management, LLC ("Rainier ). We extended our oversight and monitoring processes that support our internal control over financial reporting, as appropriate, to include Rainier's financial position, results of operations and cash flow into our consolidated financial statements from the April 30, 2016 date of acquisition through   September 30, 2016  . We are continuing to integrate the acquired operations of Rainier into our overall internal control over financial reporting and related processes. Except as disclosed in this paragraph, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as the term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
