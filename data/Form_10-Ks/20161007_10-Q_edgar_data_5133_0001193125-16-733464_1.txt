   AMERICAN GREETINGS CORPORATION   
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   
  Three and Six Months Ended August 26, 2016 and August 28, 2015   
   Note 1   Basis of Presentation      The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of American Greetings Corporation and its subsidiaries (the  Corporation ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for
complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary to fairly present financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods have been
included.    The Corporation s fiscal year ends on February 28 or 29. References to a particular year refer to the fiscal year ending in February
of that year. For example, 2016 refers to the year ended February 29, 2016. The Corporation s subsidiary, AG Retail Cards Limited is consolidated on a one-month lag corresponding with its fiscal year-end of January 28 for 2017.  
 These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Corporation s financial statements and notes thereto included in its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016, from which the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at February 29, 2016, presented herein, has been derived. Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have
been reclassified to conform to the 2017 presentation. These reclassifications had no material impact on financial position, earnings or cash flows.    The
Corporation s investments in less than majority-owned companies in which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method except when they qualify as
variable interest entities ( VIE ) and the Corporation is the primary beneficiary, in which case, the investments are consolidated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 810 ( ASC 810 ),
 Consolidation.     The Corporation provides limited credit support to Schurman Fine Papers ( Schurman ) which is a VIE as defined in
ASC 810. Schurman owns and operates specialty card and gift retail stores in the United States and Canada. The stores are primarily located in malls and strip shopping centers. This limited credit support is provided through the provision of a
liquidity guaranty ( Liquidity Guaranty ) in favor of the lenders under Schurman s senior revolving credit facility (the  Senior Credit Facility ). Pursuant to the terms of the Liquidity Guaranty, the Corporation has
guaranteed the repayment of up to $10.0 million of Schurman s borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility to help ensure that Schurman has sufficient borrowing availability under this facility. The Liquidity Guaranty is required to be backed by
a letter of credit for the term of the Liquidity Guaranty, which expires in January 2019. The Corporation s obligations under the Liquidity Guaranty generally may not be triggered unless Schurman s lenders under its Senior Credit Facility
have substantially completed the liquidation of the collateral under Schurman s Senior Credit Facility, or 91 days after the liquidation is started, whichever is earlier, and will be limited to the deficiency, if any, between the amount owed
and the amount collected in connection with the liquidation. There was no triggering event or liquidation of collateral as of August 26, 2016 requiring the use of the Liquidity Guaranty.  
 During the current period, the Corporation assessed the variable interests in Schurman and determined that a third party holder of variable interests has the
controlling financial interest in the VIE and thus, the third party, not the Corporation, is the primary beneficiary. In completing this assessment, the Corporation identified the activities that it considers most significant to the future economic
success of the VIE and determined that it does not have the power to direct those activities. As such, Schurman is not consolidated in the Corporation s results.  
      7  

Table of Contents  

  The Corporation s maximum exposure to loss as it relates to Schurman as of August 26, 2016 includes:

Liquidity Guaranty of Schurman s indebtedness of $10.0 million;        

normal course of business trade and other receivables due from Schurman of $31.3 million, the balance of which fluctuates throughout the year due to the seasonal nature of the business; and    

the retail store operating leases currently subleased to Schurman, the aggregate lease payments for the remaining life of which was $1.8 million as of August 26, 2016.    
   Note 2   Seasonal Nature of Business      A
significant portion of the Corporation s business is seasonal in nature. Therefore, the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the fiscal year taken as a whole.  
   Note 3   Recent Accounting Pronouncements      In
August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Clarification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments.  The objective of ASU 2016-15 is to eliminate the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, by adding or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow
issues. For public business entities, ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively to all
periods presented, unless deemed impracticable, in which case, prospective application is permitted. The Corporation is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standards update may have on its consolidated
financial statements.    In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  ASU 2016-13 introduces a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. The estimate of expected
credit losses will require entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to
understand the entity s assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. For public business entities, ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and the
guidance is to be applied using the modified-retrospective approach. Earlier adoption is permitted for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Corporation is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not
determined the impact this standards update may have on its consolidated financial statements.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842).  ASU 2016-02 will require lessees to recognize a   right-of-use   asset and a lease liability. The   right-of-use   asset and lease liability will be initially measured at the present value of the lease payments in the statement of financial position. Lessor accounting under the new guidance is largely
unchanged. For public business entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and
measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified-retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients. The Corporation is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the
impact this standards update may have on its consolidated financial statements.    In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial
Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. In
particular, this ASU requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. ASU 2016-01
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Corporation is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standards update may have on its consolidated financial statements.

  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and
provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a
going concern. ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Corporation does not expect that the adoption of this standards
update will impact its consolidated financial statements.    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with
Customers.  Subsequent accounting standards updates have been issued which amend and/or clarify the application of ASU 2014-09. The objective of ASU 2014-09, and its related amendments and clarifications, is to establish a single
comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the new
guidance is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. More detailed disclosures will also be required to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. For public business
entities, the new revenue recognition guidance will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Earlier adoption is permitted for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016. The new guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or modified-retrospective transition method. The Corporation is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact it may have on its
consolidated financial statements, nor the preferred method of adoption.      Note 4   Acquisitions and Dispositions    
   Sale of Strawberry Shortcake      As reported in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016, in March 2015, the Corporation completed the sale of its Strawberry Shortcake property and related intangible assets and licensing agreements ( Strawberry Shortcake )
and received cash proceeds of $105.0 million, which are reflected in  Proceeds from sale of Strawberry Shortcake  within  Investing Activities  on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended August 28,
2015. The Corporation also recognized a net gain of $61.6 million from the sale, which is included in  Other operating income   net  on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the six months ended August 28, 2015.  
   Character Property Rights Acquisition      As reported
in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016, in conjunction with and based on the proceeds resulting from the March 2015 sale of Strawberry Shortcake, the Corporation paid an additional $2.8 million for character
property rights associated with Strawberry Shortcake, that were previously purchased from a third party during 2015. This payment is included in  Cash paid for acquired character property rights  within  Investing Activities  on
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended August 28, 2015.      Sale of AGI In-Store    
 As reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016, in March 2015, the Corporation finalized the working capital
adjustments related to the 2015 sale of its wholly-owned display fixtures business, AGI In-Store, which resulted in a payment of $3.2 million to the buyer. This payment is included in  Adjustment to proceeds from sale of AGI In-Store 
within  Investing Activities  on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended August 28, 2015.

    Surrender of Certain Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies    
 As reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016, in March 2015, in connection with the 2015 surrender of certain
corporate-owned life insurance policies, the Corporation received proceeds of $24.1 million that are included in  Proceeds from surrender of corporate-owned life insurance policies  within  Investing Activities  on the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended August 28, 2015.      Note 5   Royalty Revenue and Related Expenses    
 The Corporation has agreements for licensing certain characters and other intellectual property. These license agreements provide for royalty revenue to the
Corporation, which is recorded in  Other revenue  on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These license agreements may include the receipt of upfront advances, which are recorded as deferred revenue and earned during the period of the
agreement. Revenues and expenses associated with the servicing of these agreements, primarily relating to the licensing activities included in the Non-reportable segment, are summarized as follows:  
   
     Note 6   Other Income and Expense    
   Other Operating Income   Net        
   During the three and six months ended August 26, 2016, the Corporation recognized income of $1.1 million and $2.1
million, respectively, from tax credits received from the State of Ohio under certain incentive programs made available to the Corporation in connection with its decision to maintain its world headquarters in the state of Ohio. Tax credits of $6.5
million were recognized in the quarter ended August 28, 2015.    During the six months ended August 28, 2015, the Corporation recognized a net
gain of $61.6 million from the sale of Strawberry Shortcake, which included a first quarter gain of $61.7 million and an adjustment to the gain in the second quarter of approximately $0.1 million. See Note 4 for further information.

    Note 8   Customer Allowances and Discounts    
 Trade accounts receivable is reported net of certain allowances and discounts. The most significant of these are as follows:  
   
   Certain customer allowances and discounts are settled in cash. These accounts, primarily rebates, which are classified as
 Accrued liabilities  on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, totaled $9.7 million, $16.0 million and $13.9 million as of August 26, 2016, February 29, 2016 and August 28, 2015, respectively.  
   Note 9   Inventories        
   The valuation of inventory under the Last-In, First-Out ( LIFO ) method is made at the end of each fiscal year based
on inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations, by necessity, are based on estimates of expected fiscal year-end inventory levels and costs, and are subject to final fiscal year-end LIFO inventory calculations.
   Inventory held on location for retailers with scan-based trading arrangements, which is included in finished products, totaled $65.3 million, $63.5
million and $64.2 million as of August 26, 2016, February 29, 2016 and August 28, 2015, respectively.      Note 10   Deferred
Costs      Deferred costs and future payment commitments for retail supply agreements are included in the following financial statement captions:

Table of Contents  

  The Corporation maintains an allowance for deferred costs related to supply agreements of $3.2 million, $3.6
million and $3.5 million at August 26, 2016, February 29, 2016 and August 28, 2015, respectively. This allowance is included in  Other assets  on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.  
   Note 11   Other Liabilities      Included in
 Other liabilities  on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is a deferred lease obligation related to an operating lease with H L   L Property Company ( H L   L ), for a building that will function as the
Corporation s world headquarters. The relocation to the building will be completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.    H L   L is an indirect
affiliate of the Corporation as it is indirectly owned by members of the Weiss Family (as defined in Note 17). Due to, among other things, the Corporation s involvement in the construction of the building, the Corporation is required to be
treated, for accounting purposes only, as the  deemed owner  of the new world headquarters building during the construction period. Accordingly, the Corporation has recorded an asset and associated offsetting liability during the
construction of the building, even though the Corporation does not own the asset and is not the obligor on the corresponding construction debt. The asset included in  Property, plant and equipment   at cost  and corresponding
liability included in  Other liabilities  on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, was $117.7 million, $94.7 million and $57.4 million as of August 26, 2016, February 29, 2016 and August 28, 2015,
respectively. See Note 17 for further information.      Note 12   Debt    
 Long-term debt and their related calendar year due dates as of August 26, 2016, February 29, 2016 and August 28, 2015, respectively, were
as follows:      
   At August 26, 2016, the balances outstanding on the term loan facility and revolving credit facility each bear interest
at a rate of approximately 3.0%. The revolving credit facility provides the Corporation with funding of up to $250 million. The Corporation is also a party to an accounts receivable facility that provides funding of up to $50 million, under which
there were no borrowings outstanding as of August 26, 2016, February 29, 2016 and August 28, 2015, respectively. Outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the total credit available under the revolving credit and the accounts
receivable facilities, totaled $25.9 million at August 26, 2016.    On July 27, 2016, the Corporation amended its accounts receivable
facility. The amendment modified the accounts receivable facility to, among other things: (i) extend the scheduled termination date to July 27, 2018 and (ii) revise the bases upon which fees are assessed under this facility. 
 In March 2015 the Corporation made a voluntary prepayment of $65.0 million on the term loan facility, thereby eliminating all future quarterly installment
payments prior to its August 9, 2019 maturity date. During the six months ended August 28, 2015, the Corporation expensed an additional $1.8 million of unamortized financing fees as a result of the prepayment.  
 The total fair value of the Corporation s publicly traded debt, which was considered a Level 1 valuation as it was based on quoted market prices, was
$235.5 million (at a carrying value of $225.2 million), $229.6 million (at a carrying value of $225.2 million) and $234.1 million (at a carrying value of $225.2 million) at August 26, 2016, February 29, 2016 and August 28, 2015,
respectively.

Table of Contents  

  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs.  ASU 2015-03 requires that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt, similar to the presentation of debt discounts. The Corporation adopted ASU 2015-03
effective March 1, 2016, on a retrospective basis, and accordingly, debt issuance costs of $3.3 million and $3.6 million were reclassified from  Other assets  to  Long-term debt  on the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position at February 29, 2016 and August 28, 2015, respectively.    The total fair value of the Corporation s non-publicly traded
debt, which was considered a Level 2 valuation as it was based on comparable privately traded debt prices, was $200.0 million (at a principal carrying value of $200.0 million), $185.0 million (at a principal carrying value of $185.0 million), and
$240.5 million (at a principal carrying value of $241.0 million) at August 26, 2016, February 29, 2016 and August 28, 2015, respectively.  
 At August 26, 2016, the Corporation was in compliance with the financial covenants under its borrowing agreements.  
   Note 13   Retirement Benefits      The components
of periodic benefit cost for the Corporation s defined benefit pension and postretirement benefits plans are as follows:      
   As reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016, prior to January 1, 2016, the
Corporation sponsored a discretionary profit-sharing plan with a contributory 401(k) provision covering most of its United States employees. Under this arrangement, the Corporation made separate discretionary profit-sharing and 401(k) matching
contributions annually, after fiscal year-end, depending on its financial results.    Effective January 1, 2016, the existing profit-sharing and 401(k)
retirement savings plan was replaced with a safe harbor 401(k) arrangement. Pursuant to the new arrangement, the matching contributions became non-discretionary, were increased, and are now made throughout the year, rather than on an annual basis.
The increased matching contributions effectively replace the Corporation s discretionary profit-sharing contributions, which were discontinued for fiscal years ending after February 29, 2016. The 401(k) matching contributions for the three
and six month periods ended August 26, 2016 were $3.4 million and $8.5 million, respectively, as compared to the combined expense attributable to the profit-sharing and 401(k) matching contributions for the three and six month periods ended
August 28, 2015 of $3.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively.

  At August 26, 2016, February 29, 2016 and August 28, 2015, the liability for postretirement
benefits other than pensions was $18.9 million, $17.8 million and $19.2 million, respectively, and is included in  Other liabilities  on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. At August 26, 2016, February 29, 2016
and August 28, 2015, the long-term liability for pension benefits was $77.9 million, $80.2 million and $78.6 million, respectively, and is included in  Other liabilities  on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.  
   Note 14   Fair Value Measurements      Assets and
liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the fair value hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs as of the measurement date. The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:      

Level 1   Valuation is based upon quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.        

Level 2   Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially
the full term of the financial instrument.        

Level 3   Valuation is based upon unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement.    
 The following table summarizes the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of August 26, 2016:

  The deferred compensation plan includes investments in mutual funds and a money market fund. Assets held in
mutual funds are recorded at fair value, which is considered a Level 1 valuation as it is based on each fund s quoted market value per share in an active market. The money market fund is classified as Level 2 as substantially all of the
fund s investments are determined using amortized cost. The fair value of the deferred compensation plan liabilities is based on the fair value of: (i) the plan s assets for invested deferrals and (ii) hypothetical investments
for unfunded deferrals.    The investment in equity securities is considered a Level 1 valuation as it is based upon a quoted price in an active market.
     Note 15 - Contingency      The Corporation is
presently involved in various judicial, administrative, and regulatory proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to, employment and commercial disputes. These matters are inherently subject
to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to the Corporation. These uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur, confirming the incurrence of a liability or reduction of a
liability. In accordance with ASC Topic 450,  Contingencies,  the Corporation accrues for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This accrual is included in  Accrued liabilities  on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Due to this uncertainty, the actual amount of any loss may ultimately prove to be larger
or smaller than the amounts reflected in the Corporation s Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these proceedings are at preliminary stages and some of these proceedings seek an indeterminate amount of damages.  
   Note 16   Income Taxes      The
Corporation s provision for income taxes in interim periods is computed by applying its estimated annual effective tax rate against income before income tax expense for the period. In addition, non-recurring or discrete items are recorded
during the period in which they occur. The magnitude of the impact that discrete items have on the Corporation s quarterly effective tax rate is dependent on the level of income in the period. The effective tax rate was 32.5% and 32.6% for the
three and six months ended August 26, 2016, respectively, and 21.0% and 31.7% for the three and six months ended August 28, 2015, respectively. The lower than U.S. statutory rate for the three and six month periods ended August 26,
2016 is primarily related to the domestic production activities deduction, tax treatment of corporate-owned life insurance and lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by state income tax rates on U.S. income, net of federal
benefit. The lower than statutory rate in the prior period is primarily related to the release of a $4.3 million unrecognized tax benefit due to the issuance of regulations that clarified the law and the expiration of a statute of limitations, as
well as the impact of lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, domestic production activities deduction and the tax treatment of corporate-owned life insurance.  
 As reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016, a previously nonmarketable investment established a readily determinable
fair value as the result of the investment s successfully completed initial public offering. Therefore, the Corporation began recording adjustments to mark-to-market the value of this investment. Consequently, a decrease in the
Corporation s deferred tax assets in the amount of $10.0 million and $22.0 million was recognized in other comprehensive income for the six month periods ended August 26, 2016 and August 28, 2015, respectively.  
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which simplifies the presentation of deferred
income taxes. This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a statement of financial position. The Corporation early adopted ASU 2015-17 during the fourth quarter of 2016 on a prospective basis. Adoption
of ASU 2015-17 resulted in a reclassification of the Corporation s net current deferred tax asset to the net non-current deferred tax asset in the Corporation s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of February 29, 2016. No
prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.    As of August 26, 2016, the Corporation had unrecognized tax benefits of $17.1 million that, if
recognized, would have a favorable effect on the Corporation s income tax expense of $15.4 million. It is reasonably possible that the Corporation s unrecognized tax positions as of August 26, 2016 could decrease $1.4 million during
the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.

  The Corporation recognizes interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits and refundable income
taxes as a component of income tax expense. During the six months ended August 26, 2016, the Corporation recognized a net expense of $0.2 million for interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits and refundable income taxes. As of
August 26, 2016, the total amount of gross accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits less refundable income taxes was a net payable of $1.8 million.  
 With few exceptions, the Corporation is subject to examination in the U.S. and various state and local jurisdictions for tax years 2010 to the
present. The Corporation is also subject to tax examination in various international tax jurisdictions including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Mexico and New Zealand for tax years 2011 to the present.  
   Note 17   Related Party Information    
   World Headquarters Relocation      In May 2011, the
Corporation announced that it will be relocating its world headquarters to a new location in the City of Westlake, Ohio, in a mixed-use development known as Crocker Park (the  Crocker Park Development ), which offers a vibrant urban
setting, with retail stores and restaurants, offices and apartments. After putting the project on hold pending the outcome of the going private transaction, the Corporation announced plans in October 2013 to resume the project and, on March 26,
2014, the Corporation purchased from Crocker Park, LLC, the owner of the Crocker Park Development, 14.48 acres of land at the south end of the Crocker Park Development (the  Crocker Park Site ) on which the new world headquarters will be
built. The purchase price for the land was $7.4 million (based on a per acre price of $0.5 million). Morry Weiss, the Chairman of the Board of the Corporation, Zev Weiss and Jeffrey Weiss, directors and the Co-Chief Executive Officers of the
Corporation, and Gary and Elie Weiss, directors and non-executive officers of the Corporation, together with members of their family (collectively, the  Weiss Family ), indirectly own a minority stake in Crocker Park, LLC through their
indirect ownership of approximately 37% of the membership interests in Crocker Park, LLC. In addition, Morry Weiss and other members of the Weiss Family have guaranteed certain of Crocker Park, LLC s obligations, including obligations incurred
in connection with the Crocker Park Development. The authority to conduct, manage and control the business of Crocker Park, LLC, including operating the Crocker Park Development and the decision whether to sell the Crocker Park Site to the
Corporation, was reserved to the manager of Crocker Park, LLC. The manager of Crocker Park, LLC is not an affiliate of the Weiss Family, but is an affiliate of Stark Enterprises, Inc.  
 The Corporation is leasing a portion of the Crocker Park Site to H L   L, which is constructing the new world headquarters building on the Crocker Park
Site, and beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 will lease the new world headquarters building back to the Corporation. In addition, to accommodate additional office needs, H L   L is constructing an additional approximately 60,000
square foot building ( Tech West  and, together with the world headquarters building, the  Creative Studios Buildings ) adjacent to the world headquarters building and a surface parking lot ( Surface Lot ) on land that
it is leasing from the Corporation. The Corporation has also entered into an operating lease to lease the Tech West building and Surface Lot from H L   L, also beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The initial lease terms are fifteen
years and the annual rent is expected to be approximately $10.6 million. See Note 11 for further information.    Although the majority of the costs to
construct the new world headquarters was financed through H L   L, due to the inherent difficulty in estimating costs associated with projects of this scale and nature, the costs associated with this project may have been higher
than expected and the Corporation may have had to dedicate additional funds to the project, including providing additional funds to H L   L. As a result, effective as of December 1, 2014, the Corporation entered into a loan
agreement with H L   L under which the Corporation may from time to time make revolving loans to H L   L. Loans made to H L   L under this agreement may only be used to fund construction costs associated
with the world headquarters project and the maximum principal and market-rate interest that may be outstanding as of any given time under this loan agreement may not exceed $9.0 million. There were no amounts outstanding under this loan agreement as
of August 26, 2016, February 29, 2016 and August 28, 2015.

    Transactions with Parent Companies and Other Affiliated Companies    
 From time to time employees of the Corporation may provide services to its parent companies as well as companies that are owned or controlled by members of the
Weiss Family, in each case provided that such services do not interfere with the Corporation s employees  ability to perform services on its behalf. When providing such services, the affiliated companies reimburse the Corporation for such
services, based on the costs of employing the individual (including salary and benefits) and the amount of time spent by such employee in providing services to the affiliated company.  
 The Corporation paid cash dividends in the aggregate amount of $13.9 million to Century Intermediate Holding Company ( Parent ), its parent and sole
shareholder during the six months ended August 26, 2016, for the sole purpose of paying interest on the $285.0 million aggregate principal amount 9.750%/10.500% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2019, (the  PIK  notes) which were issued by
Century Intermediate Holding Company 2, an indirect parent of the Corporation.    The Corporation, Parent and certain of their subsidiaries and affiliates,
file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The Corporation pays all taxes on behalf of the group included in this consolidated federal income tax return. Pursuant to this tax sharing arrangement, there was $0.3 million due from
affiliates at August 26, 2016 and February 29, 2016 and no amounts due to or due from affiliates as of August 28, 2015.      Note 18

      Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations      This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in
conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements. This discussion and analysis, and other statements made in this Report, contain forward-looking statements. See  Factors That May Affect Future Results  at the end of this
discussion and analysis for a description of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the  Corporation,   we,   our,

   Overview       Second Quarter Results of Operations
    Total revenue for the current year second quarter was $377.0 million, a decrease of $44.0 million, or 10.5%, compared to the prior year
period. This decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales of greeting cards, gift packaging and party goods, as well as an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of approximately $13 million. Excluding the impact of foreign
currency translation, the lower revenue was primarily within the North American Social Expression Products and International Social Expression Products segments.  
 Second quarter operating income was $21.7 million, a decrease of $15.7 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The current and prior year
quarters include income of $1.1 million and $6.5 million, respectively, from tax credits received from the State of Ohio to maintain our world headquarters in Ohio. Net of the year-over-year impact of the tax credits, the remaining earnings decrease
was primarily within our North American Social Expression Products segment driven by lower sales.

    Results of Operations    
   Three months ended August 26, 2016 and August 28, 2015    
 Net income was $10.3 million in the second quarter compared to $24.5 million in the prior year period.  
 Our results for the three months ended August 26, 2016 and August 28, 2015 are summarized below:  
   
   For the three months ended August 26, 2016, consolidated net sales were $374.7 million, down from $418.6 million in the
prior year second quarter. This 10.5%, or $43.9 million, decrease was driven by lower sales of greeting cards of approximately $23 million, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $13 million, and lower sales of gift
packaging and party goods of approximately $9 million. The current year quarter includes a nominal impact related to scan-based trading ( SBT ) implementations, which is favorable to the prior year quarter by approximately $1.5 million.
    Wholesale Unit and Pricing Analysis for Greeting Cards   
 Unit and pricing comparatives (on a sales less returns basis), excluding intercompany eliminations and the impact of foreign currency translation, for the
three months ended August 26, 2016 and August 28, 2015 are summarized below:      
   During the second quarter, combined everyday and seasonal greeting card sales less returns decreased 5.1% compared to the
prior year quarter, including a decrease in unit volume of 7.7%, partially offset by an increase in selling prices of 2.9%. The overall decrease was driven by decreased unit volumes in both everyday and seasonal greeting cards in our North American
Social Expression Products and International Social Expressions Products segments, partially offset by an increase in selling prices in both the everyday and seasonal greeting cards in our International Social Expressions Products segment.  
      21  

Table of Contents  

  Everyday card sales less returns during the three months ended August 26, 2016 decreased 4.8% compared to
the prior year quarter primarily due to decreased unit volume experienced in the International Social Expression Products segment that was partially offset by selling price increases. The lower unit volume in the International Social Expression
Products segment was primarily the continuation of the reduced distribution to a significant customer.    Seasonal card sales less returns decreased 6.7%
during the second quarter, including a 10.5% decrease in unit volume, offset by an increase in selling price of 4.2%. Due to the fact that the second quarter has the fewest holidays, the impact of changes in selling price and unit volume appear
large on a percentage basis, compared to other quarters. The decrease in unit volume was primarily driven by the Father s Day program in our International Social Expression Products segment, primarily due to the continuation of the reduced
distribution to a significant customer, as well as the Father s Day and Fall programs in our North American Social Expression Products segment. The selling price increase was primarily driven by the Father s Day program in our
International Social Expression Products segment and the Fall program in our North American Social Expression Products segment.     Expense Overview
    Material, labor and other production costs ( MLOPC ) for the three months ended August 26, 2016 were $159.2 million, compared to $178.0
million in the prior year three months. As a percentage of total revenue, these costs were 42.2% in the current period compared to 42.3% for the three months ended August 28, 2015. The $18.8 million decrease was primarily due to the impact of
lower sales volume and favorable product mix in the wholesale card business of approximately $12 million, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $7 million and favorable production expenses of approximately $5 million.
Partially offsetting these decreases were higher scrap expenses of approximately $3 million and higher product content costs of approximately $2 million.  
 Selling, distribution and marketing ( SDM ) expenses for the three months ended August 26, 2016 were $142.1 million, decreasing $11.5 million
from $153.6 million in the prior year second quarter. As a percentage of total revenue, these costs were 37.7% in the current period compared to 36.5% for the prior year period. The dollar decrease in the current year second quarter was driven by
the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $7 million, lower expenses in our Retail Operations segment of approximately $3 million, and other cost savings of approximately $1 million.  
 Administrative and general expenses were $55.8 million for the three months ended August 26, 2016, a decrease of $3.6 million from $59.4 million for the
three months ended August 28, 2015. This decrease was driven primarily by lower technology costs, predominantly related to our information technology systems refresh project of approximately $2 million, and the favorable impact of foreign
currency translation of approximately $1 million.    Other operating income   net was $1.7 million for the three months ended August 26, 2016
compared to $7.3 million for the prior year second quarter. The current year period includes income of $1.1 million compared to $6.5 million in the prior year period, from tax credits received from the State of Ohio under certain incentive programs
made available to us in connection with our decision to maintain our world headquarters in Ohio.    The effective tax rate was 32.5% and 21.0% for the three
months ended August 26, 2016 and August 28, 2015, respectively. The lower than statutory rate for the current period is primarily related to the domestic production activities deduction, tax treatment of corporate-owned life insurance and
lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by state income tax rates on U.S. income, net of federal benefit. The lower than statutory rate in the prior period was primarily related to the release of a $4.3 million unrecognized tax
benefit due to the issuance of regulations that clarified the law and the expiration of a statute of limitations, as well as the impact of lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, domestic production activities deduction and the tax treatment of
corporate-owned life insurance.

    Results of Operations    
   Six months ended August 26, 2016 and August 28, 2015    
 Net income was $36.8 million in the six months ended August 26, 2016 compared to $97.2 million in the prior year six months.  
 Our results for the six months ended August 26, 2016 and August 28, 2015 are summarized below:  
   
   For the six months ended August 26, 2016, consolidated net sales were $811.9 million, down from $890.5 million in the
prior year six months. This 8.8%, or $78.6 million, decrease was driven by lower sales of greeting cards of approximately $47 million, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $20 million, lower sales of our gift
packaging and party goods of approximately $11 million, and decreased sales of other ancillary products of approximately $2 million. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact of fewer SBT implementations of approximately $1
million. The impact of SBT implementations in the current year six months was a charge of approximately $1 million.     Wholesale Unit and Pricing
Analysis for Greeting Cards     Unit and pricing comparatives (on a sales less returns basis), excluding intercompany eliminations and the impact of
foreign currency translation, for the six months ended August 26, 2016 and August 28, 2015 are summarized below:      
   During the six months ended August 26, 2016, combined everyday and seasonal greeting card sales less returns decreased
5.1% compared to the prior year six months. The overall decrease was primarily driven by decreased unit volume, partially offset with increased selling prices from our everyday and seasonal greeting cards in our International Social Expression
Products segment.  
      23  

Table of Contents  

  Everyday card sales less returns are down 5.2% compared to the prior year six months, as a result of decreased
unit volume of 7.4%, partially offset by an increase in selling prices of 2.4%. The unit volume decrease is primarily due to the continuation of the reduced distribution to a significant customer in our International Social Expression Products
segment, as well as lower sales within our North American Social Expression Products segment. The increase in selling prices was driven by our International Social Expression Products segment.  
 Seasonal card sales less returns decreased 4.9%, with a unit volume decline of 7.6%, offset by a selling price increase of 3.0%. The decrease in unit volume
was attributable to our Easter, Mother s Day, and Father s Day programs in our International Social Expression Products segment, primarily due to the continuation of the reduced distribution to a significant customer, as well as the Easter
and Father s Day programs in our North American Social Expression Products segment. The increase in selling prices was driven by our Mother s Day and Easter programs in our International Social Expression Products segment, and our
Father s Day program in both our North American Social Expression Products and International Social Expression Products segments, partially offset by a decrease in our Easter program in our North American Social Expression Products segment.
    Expense Overview     MLOPC for the six months ended
August 26, 2016 were $338.1 million, a decrease of $35.4 million from $373.5 million for the comparable period in the prior year. As a percentage of total revenue, these costs were 41.4% in the current period compared to 41.8% for the six
months ended August 28, 2015. The $35.4 million dollar decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower sales volume and favorable product mix in the wholesale card business of approximately $20 million, the favorable impact of foreign
currency translation of approximately $9 million, favorable production expenses of approximately $9 million, and the favorable impact of lower sales in the Retail Operations segment of approximately $1 million. Partially offsetting these decreases
were higher product content costs of approximately $3 million and unfavorable scrap expense of approximately $1 million.    SDM expenses for the six months
ended August 26, 2016 were $295.6 million, decreasing $21.8 million from $317.4 million for the comparable period in the prior year. As a percentage of total revenue, these costs were 36.2% in the current period compared to 35.5% for the prior
year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $11 million, lower expenses in the Retail Operations segment of approximately $4 million, decreased marketing and advertising
costs of approximately $4 million, and lower supply chain costs of approximately $3 million.    Administrative and general expenses were $119.8 million for
the six months ended August 26, 2016, an increase of $2.2 million from $117.6 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven primarily by higher technology costs, predominantly related to our information technology systems refresh
project of approximately $2 million and higher combined 401(k) match and profit-sharing expense of approximately $2 million, offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $2 million. See  Segment Information
  Unallocated Items  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information related to our combined  401(k) match and profit-sharing expense.  
 Other operating income   net was $3.6 million for the six months ended August 26, 2016 compared to $69.7 million for the prior year six month
period. The current year six month period includes $2.1 million compared to $6.5 million in the prior year period, from tax credits received from the State of Ohio under certain incentive programs made available to us in connection with our decision
to maintain our world headquarters in Ohio. Additionally, the prior year includes the net gain on the sale of Strawberry Shortcake of $61.6 million.    The
effective tax rate was 32.6% and 31.7% for the six months ended August 26, 2016 and August 28, 2015, respectively. The lower than U.S. statutory rate for the six month period ended August 26, 2016 is primarily related to the domestic
production activities deduction, tax treatment of corporate-owned life insurance and lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by state income tax rates on U.S. income, net of federal benefit. The lower than statutory rate in the
prior period was primarily related to the release of a $4.3 million unrecognized tax benefit due to the issuance of regulations that clarified the law and the expiration of a statute of limitations, as well as the impact of lower tax rates in
foreign jurisdictions, domestic production activities deduction and the tax treatment of corporate-owned life insurance.

   Total revenue of our North American Social Expression Products segment decreased $14.8 million for the three months ended
August 26, 2016 and decreased $27.9 million for the six months ended August 26, 2016 compared to the prior year periods. The decrease during the current quarter was primarily driven by lower sales of gift packaging and party goods of
approximately $9 million, greeting cards of approximately $6 million, and other ancillary products of approximately $1 million, partially offset by the favorable impact of fewer SBT implementations of approximately $1.5 million. The decrease in
total revenue for the six months ended August 26, 2016 was primarily attributable to sales declines of greetings cards of approximately $16 million, gift packaging and party goods of approximately $10 million, other ancillary products of
approximately $2 million, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $1 million. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact of fewer SBT implementations of approximately $1 million.  
 Segment earnings decreased $8.6 million in the current quarter compared to the three months ended August 28, 2015. The decline was driven primarily by
the impact of lower revenues, higher costs in our supply chain of approximately $1 million, partially offset by lower technology costs of approximately $2 million.  
 Segment earnings decreased $21.6 million in the six month period ended August 26, 2016 compared to the prior year period. This decrease was driven
primarily by the impact of lower revenues, higher technology costs of approximately $2 million and higher business taxes of approximately $1 million. These decreases were offset by lower costs in our supply chain of approximately $1 million and
other general cost savings of approximately $1 million.

   International Social Expression Products Segment   
   
   Total revenue of our International Social Expression Products segment decreased $18.0 million for the three month period ended
August 26, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of greeting cards of approximately $14 million and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $4 million. Total
revenue of our International Social Expression Products segment decreased $32.9 million for the six month period ended August 26, 2016 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of greeting cards of
approximately $27 million and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $6 million. The lower sales of greetings cards in both the three and six month periods ended August 26, 2016 are, as expected, primarily the
result of the continuation of the reduced distribution to a significant customer.    Segment earnings decreased $2.1 million in the three months ended
August 26, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease is driven primarily by the impact on earnings from lower sales, offset by favorable supply chain costs of approximately $2 million and cost savings initiatives
undertaken to offset the impact of lower sales of approximately $1 million.    Segment loss decreased $0.4 million in the six months ended August 26,
2016, compared to the six months ended August 28, 2015. The decrease in segment loss was primarily driven by favorable supply chain costs of approximately $6 million, lower production expenses of approximately $4 million, favorable scrap
expense of approximately $2 million, and cost savings initiatives undertaken to offset the impact of lower sales of approximately $2 million, offset by the margin impact of lower sales of approximately $14 million.  
  Retail Operations Segment       
   Total revenue of our Retail Operations segment decreased $10.4 million and $16.8 million for the three and six months ended
August 26, 2016, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decreases were driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $9 million and $12 million for the three and six month periods,
respectively, as well as lower sales of greeting cards in both the three and six month periods. During the three and six month periods ended August 26, 2016, net sales at stores open one year or more were down approximately 0.1% and 0.6%,
respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.    Segment loss decreased $1.9 million and $2.6 million in the three and six month periods
ended August 26, 2016 compared to the prior year periods, respectively. The improved earnings in both the three and six months ended August 26, 2016 were primarily driven by lower retail store operating expenses and the favorable impact of
foreign currency translation on the loss, partially offset by lower margins resulting from the decrease in revenue.

   AG Interactive Segment       
   Total revenue of our AG Interactive segment decreased $0.6 million and $1.1 million for the three and six months ended
August 26, 2016, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in revenue for the three months ended August 26, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency
translation. The decrease in revenue for the six months ended August 26, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven primarily by lower subscription revenue as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. At
the end of the second quarter of 2017, AG Interactive had approximately 3.3 million online paid subscriptions compared to 3.4 million at the end of the same period in the prior year.  
 Segment earnings decreased $1.4 million and $2.0 million for the three and six months ended August 26, 2016 primarily due to the impact of lower revenue
and higher operating expenses.     Non-reportable Segment       
   Total revenue of our Non-reportable segment decreased $0.2 million for the three months ended August 26, 2016 and
increased $0.5 million for the six months ended August 26, 2016, compared to the prior year periods.    Segment loss decreased $0.5 million for the
three months ended August 26, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower film production costs. Segment earnings decreased $59.8 million for the six months ended August 26, 2016 compared to the prior year period, which
was primarily due to the net gain of $61.6 million recorded in connection with the 2016 sale of Strawberry Shortcake, partially offset by lower film production costs in the current year.  
  Unallocated Items     Centrally incurred and managed costs
are not allocated back to the operating segments. The unallocated items include interest expense for centrally-incurred debt, domestic 401(k) match and profit-sharing expense, as well as costs associated with corporate operations such as the senior
management, corporate finance, legal and insurance programs.      
   Interest expense is lower by $0.5 million in the three month period ended August 26, 2016 compared to the same period in
the prior year primarily due to the interest capitalized in conjunction with our systems refresh project. Interest expense is lower by $3.1 million in the six month period ended August 26, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year
primarily due to the prior year write-off of debt issuance costs of $1.9 million due to our voluntary prepayment of our Term Loan facility, and the continued interest capitalized in conjunction with our systems refresh project of $1.1 million.

  As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016, prior to January 1,
2016, we sponsored a discretionary profit-sharing plan with a contributory 401(k) provision covering most of its United States employees. Under this arrangement, we made separate discretionary profit-sharing and 401(k) matching contributions
annually, after fiscal year-end, depending on our financial results.    Effective January 1, 2016, the existing profit-sharing and 401(k) retirement
savings plan was replaced with a safe harbor 401(k) arrangement. Pursuant to the new arrangement, the matching contributions became non-discretionary, were increased, and are now made throughout the year, rather than on an annual basis. The
increased matching contributions effectively replace our discretionary profit-sharing contributions, which were discontinued for fiscal years ending after February 29, 2016. We expect that the current year quarterly expense will vary from the
prior year expense pattern and the full year 2017 expense to be slightly higher than the combined profit-sharing and match components of the profit-sharing and 401(k) retirement savings plan in effect during the prior year.  
  Corporate overhead expense  for the three and six month periods ended August 26, 2016, includes income of $1.1 million and $2.1 million,
respectively, from tax credits received from the State of Ohio under certain incentive programs made available to us in connection with our decision to maintain our world headquarters in the state of Ohio. The three and six month periods in the
prior year included $6.5 million related to these incentives.      Liquidity and Capital Resources    
 The seasonal nature of our business precludes a useful comparison of the current period and the fiscal year-end financial statements; therefore, a Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position as of August 28, 2015, has been included.     Operating Activities   
 Operating activities used $32.0 million of cash during the six months ended August 26, 2016, compared to using $65.5 million in the prior year period.
   Accounts receivable provided $17.9 million of cash during the six months ended August 26, 2016, compared to a use of $3.4 million of cash during the
prior year period. The year-over-year increase in cash flow of approximately $21.3 million occurred mainly within our North American Social Expression Products segment primarily due to lower sales and the timing of collections from, or credits
issued to, certain customers occurring in a different pattern in the current year period compared to the prior year period in both our North American Social Expression Products and International Social Expression Products segments.  
 Inventory used $65.5 million of cash during the six months ended August 26, 2016, compared to $49.9 million in the prior year six months. Historically,
the first half of our fiscal year is a period of inventory build, and thus a use of cash, in preparation for the fall and winter seasonal holidays.  
 Deferred costs - net generally represents payments under agreements with retailers net of the related amortization of those payments. During the six months
ended August 26, 2016, amortization exceeded payments by $17.5 million. During the six months ended August 28, 2015, amortization exceeded payments by $19.4 million. See Note 10,  Deferred Costs,  to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further detail of deferred costs related to customer agreements.    Accounts payable and other liabilities used $83.5 million of cash during
the six months ended August 26, 2016, compared to using $91.7 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year change in cash usage was attributable to an increase in accounts payable payments due to normal year-over-year timing of business
transactions.

   Investing Activities   
 Investing activities used $45.2 million of cash during the six months ended August 26, 2016, compared to a source of $91.4 million in the prior year
period. The current year includes primarily capital expenditures of $46.0 million. The prior year included capital expenditures of $31.7 million, and cash payments of $2.8 million and $3.2 million for acquired character property rights and the final
working capital adjustments made in connection with the sale of AGI In-Store, respectively. These cash uses were offset by proceeds of $105.0 received from the sale of Strawberry Shortcake and proceeds of $24.1 million received from the surrender of
certain corporate-owned life insurance policies.     Financing Activities   
 Financing activities provided $1.1 million of cash during the current year six months, compared to a use of $34.0 million in the prior year six month period.
The current year source of cash was driven by additional borrowings, net of repayments, under our revolving credit facility of $15.0 million, partially offset by a cash dividend payment of $13.9 million. The prior year use of cash was primarily
driven by a voluntary prepayment made on our term loan of $65.0 million and cash dividend payments of $20.7 million, partially offset by additional borrowings, net of repayments, under our revolving credit facility of $51.7 million.  
  Credit Sources     Substantial credit sources are available
to us. In total, we had available sources of credit of approximately $485 million at August 26, 2016, which included $185 million outstanding on our term loan facility, a $250 million revolving credit facility and a $50 million accounts
receivable securitization facility, of which, $259.1 million, in the aggregate, was unused as of August 26, 2016. Borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility are limited based on our eligible receivables outstanding. At
August 26, 2016, we had $15 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and we had no borrowings outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization facility. We had, in the aggregate, $25.9 million outstanding
under letters of credit, which reduced the total credit availability thereunder as of August 26, 2016.    Please refer to the discussion of our
borrowing arrangements as disclosed in the  Credit Sources  section under Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016 for further information.  
 At August 26, 2016, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the borrowing agreements described above.  
  Capital Deployment and Investments     On February 10,
2014, Century Intermediate Holding Company 2 ( CIHC2 ), an indirect parent of American Greetings, issued $285 million aggregate principal amount of 9.750%/10.500% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2019 (the  PIK Notes ). Excluding the
first and last interest payment periods, which must be paid in cash, CIHC2 may elect to either accrue or pay cash interest on the PIK Notes. The PIK Notes carry a cash interest rate of 9.750%. Prior to the payment of interest by CIHC2, it is
expected that we will provide CIHC2 with the cash flow for CIHC2 to pay interest on the PIK Notes. Assuming interest is paid regularly in cash, rather than accrued, the annual cash required to pay the interest is expected to be approximately $27.8
million while the entire issuance of PIK Notes are outstanding. For further information, refer to the discussion of the PIK Notes as disclosed in   Transactions with Parent Companies and Other Affiliated Companies   in Note 18,
 Related Party Information,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016.  
 Throughout fiscal 2017 and thereafter, we will continue to consider all options for capital deployment including growth opportunities, acquisitions and other
investments in third parties, expanding customer relationships, expenditures or investments related to our current product leadership initiatives or other future strategic initiatives, capital expenditures, the information technology systems refresh
project, paying down debt, paying dividends and, as appropriate, preserving cash. Our future operating cash flow and borrowing availability under our credit

agreement and our accounts receivable securitization facility are expected to meet these and other currently anticipated funding requirements. The seasonal nature of our business results in peak
working capital requirements that may be financed through short-term borrowings when cash on hand is insufficient.    Over the next several years, we expect
to allocate resources, including capital, to refresh our information technology systems by modernizing our systems, redesigning and deploying new processes, and evolving new organization structures, all of which are intended to drive efficiencies
within the business and add new capabilities. Amounts that we spend could be material in any fiscal year and over the life of the project. During the six months ended August 26, 2016, we spent approximately $33 million, including capital of
approximately $29 million and expense of approximately $4 million, on these information technology systems. Based on the current scope of the project, we presently expect to spend at least an additional $162 million on these information technology
systems, the majority of which we expect will be capital expenditures. We believe these investments are important to our business, help us drive further efficiencies and add new capabilities; however, there can be no assurance that we will not spend
more or less than $162 million, or that we will achieve the anticipated efficiencies or any cost savings.    In May 2011, we announced plans to relocate our
world headquarters to the Crocker Park mixed use development in Westlake, Ohio, which offers a vibrant urban setting, with retail stores and restaurants, offices and apartments. After putting the project on hold pending the outcome of the going
private transaction, we announced plans in October 2013 to resume the project and on March 26, 2014, we purchased the land on which the new world headquarters will be built (the  Crocker Park Site ). We are leasing a portion of the
Crocker Park Site to H L   L Property Company ( H L   L ), an indirect affiliate of American Greetings, which is constructing the new world headquarters building on the Crocker Park Site and, beginning in the third quarter of our
fiscal 2017, will sublease the new world headquarters building back to the Corporation. In addition, to accommodate additional office needs, H L   L is constructing an additional approximately 60,000 square foot building ( Tech West )
adjacent to the world headquarters building and a surface parking lot ( Surface Lot ) on land that it is leasing from the Corporation. The Corporation has also entered into an operating lease to lease the Tech West building and Surface Lot
from H L   L, also beginning in third quarter of fiscal 2017. The initial lease terms are fifteen years and the annual rent is expected to be approximately $10.6 million. Further details of the relocation undertaking are provided in Note 18,
 Related Party Information,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 and Note 17,  Related Party Information,  to the
Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.    During the quarter ended August 26, 2016, we paid a cash dividend in the
aggregate amount of $13.9 million to Century Intermediate Holding Company, our parent and sole shareholder, for the purpose of paying interest on the PIK Notes.  
   Critical Accounting Policies      Our consolidated
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Please refer to the discussion of our Critical Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 7 of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016.      Factors That May Affect Future Results    
 Certain statements in this report may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws. These statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use such words as  anticipate,   estimate,   expect,   project,   intend,   plan, 
 believe  and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, but are subject to a
variety of uncertainties, unknown risks and other factors concerning our operations and business environment, which are difficult to predict and may be beyond our control. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those suggested by these forward-looking statements, and that could adversely affect our future financial performance, include, but are not limited to, the following:

the loss of one or more retail customers and/or retail consolidations, acquisitions and bankruptcies, including the possibility of resulting adverse changes to retail contract terms;    

competitive terms of sale offered to customers, including costs and other terms associated with new and expanded customer relationships;    

our ability to successfully complete the turnaround efforts in our retail business in the UK;        

risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space for our retail stores;

the outcome of any legal claims, known or unknown.      The risks and uncertainties identified above are not the
only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us. Should any known or unknown risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, or underlying
assumptions prove inaccurate, these developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further information concerning the risks we face and issues that could materially affect our
financial performance related to forward-looking statements, refer to our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the  Risk Factors  section included in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016.        Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
     The majority of inventory purchases within our UK wholesale operations are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Subsequent to the Brexit event, we
estimate that a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the UK Pound Sterling, compared to the average exchange rate during the year ended February 29, 2016, would negatively impact fiscal 2017 operating income in the
International Social Expression Products segment by approximately $5 million.    For further information, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended February 29, 2016.

      Item 4. Controls and Procedures    
 American Greetings maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Corporation s management, including its Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  
 American Greetings carries out a variety of on-going procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation s management,
including its Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the Co-Chief Executive Officers
and Chief Financial Officer of American Greetings concluded that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  
 There has been no change in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting during the Corporation s most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
