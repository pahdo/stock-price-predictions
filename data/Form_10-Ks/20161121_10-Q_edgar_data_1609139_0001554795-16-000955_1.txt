INNERSCOPE
ADVERTISING AGENCY, INC.   

   Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

   (Unaudited)   

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION   

Business    

InnerScope Advertising
Agency, Inc. ( Company ,  Innerscope  or  ISAA ) is a Nevada Corporation incorporated June
15, 2012, with its principal place of business in Roseville, California. ISAA was formed to provide advertising and marketing
services to retail establishments in the hearing device industry. On June 20, 2012, ISAA entered into an Acquisition and Plan
of Share Exchange with InnerScope Advertising Agency, LLC ( ILLC ), a commonly owned entity, whereby ISAA acquired
100% of ILLC. On November 1, 2013, ISAA entered into an Acquisition and Plan of Share Exchange with Intela-Hear, LLC ( Intela-Hear ),
a commonly owned entity, whereby ISAA acquired 100% of the outstanding equity of Intela-Hear in exchange for 27,000,000 shares
of the Company s common stock. This resulted in Intela-Hear becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  

ISAA
provides a comprehensive range of services (including consulting services), grouped into four fundamental disciplines: advertising/marketing,
customer relationship management, public relations and specialty communications. The Company serves the retail hearing aid dispensing
community through generating traffic and consumer interest for hearing aid dispensing practices. During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, approximately 43% and 70%, respectively, of the Company s revenue was generated from a related
party, compared to approximately 83% and 82% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company
and the related party agreed to cancel the Marketing Agreement which generated these revenues as a result of the sale by the related
party of substantially all of their assets. See note 5.  

On October 28,
2016, a majority of the Company s shareholders, based on the Company s Board of Directors (the  BOD )
recommendation, approved a forward split of the common stock whereby an additional two shares of common stock will be issued for
every share of common stock outstanding (the  Forward Split ). The Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation with the State of Nevada on October 31, 2016. All share amounts for all periods presented have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect the Forward Split.  

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    

Basis of
Presentation and Principles of Consolidation    

The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments necessary to present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the stated periods have been
made. Except as described below, these adjustments consist only of normal and recurring adjustments. Certain information and note
disclosures normally included in the Company s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated unaudited financial
statements should be read in conjunction with a reading of the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in Form S-1/A filed with the SEC on July 15, 2016. Interim results of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of future results for the full year. Certain amounts from the 2015
period have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in the current period.  

The condensed
consolidated financial statements of the Company  include
the consolidated accounts of Innerscope and its  wholly owned subsidiaries ILLC and Intela-Hear, a California limited liability
company. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.     

Emerging
Growth Companies    

The
Company qualifies as an  emerging growth company  under the 2012 JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that
an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company, the Company can delay the adoption
of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company has elected to take
advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.  

Use of
Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of
revenues and expenses during the reported period. Significant estimates relied upon in preparing these financial statements
include collectability of accounts receivable, accounts receivable from a related party and notes receivable from an officer,
inventory allowances for slow moving or obsolete inventory and the allocation of our President s compensation
to the company. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents    

The Company considers
all highly liquid investments with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried
at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalent balances may, at certain times, exceed federally insured limits.
If the amount of a deposit at any time exceeds the federally insured amount at a bank, the uninsured portion of the deposit could
be lost, in whole or in part, if the bank were to fail. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $49,402 in excess of the
federally insured limit.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that four basic criteria are
met (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of products and services has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed
or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue during the period in which the services
are performed. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $246,325 into revenue related to
the Marketing and Consulting Agreements.  During the same periods the Company recognized zero revenue related
to the Store Expansion agreement . 

Deferred
Revenue    

The
Company records deferred revenues from the Store Expansion and Consulting Agreements when cash has been received, but the related
services have not been provided. Deferred revenue will be recognized when the services are provided and the terms of the agreements
have been fulfilled. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has deferred revenue of $377,223 related to the Consulting and Expansion
agreements.  

Advertising
and Marketing Expenses    

The Company expenses
advertising and marketing costs as incurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did
not incur any advertising and marketing expenses.  

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments    

The Company's
financial instruments consist primarily of cash, amount due from related party (MFHC), notes and interest receivable officer and
accounts payable. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due
to the short-term maturities.  The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would
realize in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows.  

Income
Taxes    

The Company accounts
for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the
estimated future tax effects, calculated at the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of realization. A valuation allowance
related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not
be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date
of enactment.  

ASC 740-10 prescribes
a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides
guidance on recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition
issues. Interest and penalties are classified as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, the Company has not been
assessed, nor paid, any interest or penalties.  

Uncertain tax
positions are measured and recorded by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold
at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized.  

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share    

The Company reports
earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share.  Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed
by dividing net income (loss), after deducting preferred stock dividends accumulated during the period, by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net loss by
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities outstanding
during the period. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any outstanding common stock equivalents or any
other potentially dilutive securities.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

Recent
accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and the SEC did not have, or are not believed by management to have, a material impact
on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE 3  
GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT S PLANS   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a
going concern. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company had net income of $61,443 and generated cash of
$193,645 in operations. Through August 5, 2016, the Company was dependent on the Marketing Agreement with MFHC, (the Company
and MFHC agreed to cancel the Marketing Agreement which generated these revenues as a result of the sale by MFHC of
substantially all of their assets) and is now dependent on the Consulting, Store Expansion and Marketing Agreements. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Management s
Plans     

The
Company s plans include the realization of the Expansion Agreement, Consulting Agreement and Marketing Agreement to provide the Company with working capital. The Company plans also include setting up an alliance (the
 Alliance ). On April 2, 2013, The Company executed a 10 Year Supply Agreement with GN Hearing Care Corporation,
DBA as GN Resound ( GN Resound ), one of the world s leading manufacturers of hearing devices. This supply
agreement enables the Company to offer hearing aids to independent hearing aid practitioners. The Alliance will setup members
to sell private label hearing devices that are manufactured and shipped by GN ReSound.  

NOTE 4  
NOTE RECEIVABLE, OFFICER   

On April 1, and
June 25, 2013, in exchange for two notes receivable, the Company loaned the President of the Company $10,000 and $10,500, respectively.
The terms of the notes include an interest rate of 1.5% per annum and the notes, as amended are due on their fifth year anniversary,
with quarterly payment beginning October 1, 2016. Interest income, related party of $77 and $231 was recorded for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, notes and interest
receivable, related party was $21,541 and $21,311, respectively.  

NOTE 5  
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

The Company loaned
the President $20,500 during the year ended December 31, 2013 (see Note 4). The Company recorded interest income of $77 and $231
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

  Pursuant
to a Marketing Agreement (cancelled August 5, 2016), the Company provided marketing programs to promote and sell hearing aid instruments
and related devices to Moore Family Hearing Company ( MFHC ). MFHC owned and operated retail hearing aid stores. Based
on common control of MFHC and the Company, all transactions with MFHC are classified as related party transactions. On August
8, 2016, in consideration of $128,000 (the  Cancellation Fee ), MFHC and the Company agreed to cancel the Marketing
Agreement as a result of the sale by MFHC of substantially all of their assets. On August 11, MFHC paid
$229,622 to the Company (inclusive of the balance owed as of June 30, 2016, the Cancellation Fee and other related party activity).  

  Pursuant
to the Marketing Agreement, beginning in January 2014, the monthly fee was increased from $2,500 to $3,200 per retail location.
For January through June 2015, there were 18 MFHC retail stores and one store was added July 1, 2015, resulting in revenues of
$182,400 and $528,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. From January 1, 2016 thru August 5,
2016, there were 20 stores resulting in revenue of $74,667 and $458,667 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.
Also, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company invoiced MFHC $92,108 and $330,353, respectively,
for the production, printing and mailing of direct mail advertising materials. Lastly, the Company recognized $128,000 from the
Cancellation Fee of the Marketing Agreement as related party income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The
Company has offset the accounts receivable owed from MFHC for expenses of the Company that have been paid by MFHC. As a result
of these payments in addition to MFHC s payments to the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the balance
due from MFHC as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is $18,696 and $99,496, respectively.  

On April 1, 2013,
the Company entered into a five year sublease agreement with MFHC to sublease approximately 729 square feet of office space for
$1,500 per month. The monthly rent reduced the amounts owed to the Company from MFHC for the marketing services provided to MFHC.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company expensed $4,500 and $13,500 related to this lease.  

On February 1,
2016, the Company entered into a one year sublease agreement with MFHC to sublease approximately 2,119 square feet of office space
for $4,026 per month. The monthly rent reduced the amounts owed to the Company from MFHC for the marketing services provided to
MFHC. Effective April 30, 2016, MFHC released the Company from the sublease. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company expensed $15,078, respectively, related to this lease.  

Effective August
1, 2016 the Company began compensating the CEO and CFO $225,000 and $125,000, respectively. The Company is currently negotiating
the terms and condition of an employment contracts for the CEO and CFO including the annual salary as stated.  

For the three
and nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s President was being compensated from MFHC, as he also
held a position with MFHC. Prior to August 1, 2016, the Company estimated the portion of the President s salary that should
be allocated to the Company, and subsequent to August 1, 2016, the Company agreed to compensation of $225,000 per year. Accordingly,
the Company has expensed $37,500 and $60,791 for the President, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively
and $13,125 and $36,790 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Effective August 1, 2016, the Company
agreed to compensate our Chief Financial Officer $125,000 per annum. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company recognized $20,833 of expense.  

In
September 2016, certain of the Company s stockholders organized a new limited liability company in the state of California. As
of September 30, 2016, the Company advanced the related party $441,000 based on proposed consulting services. In October
2016, the Company advanced an additional $229,500 to the related party based on proposed consulting services. In November 2016,
the related party returned $610,500 as the Company and the related party decided not to follow through with the consulting agreements.
  The difference of the amount advanced of $670,500 and the amount returned to the Company of
$610,500, will be deducted from payments due the same stockholder(s).  

In
November 2016, our Chairman formed a California limited liability Company ( LLC ), for the purpose of providing
consulting services to the Company.   The Company intends to enter into an agreement with
the LLC and to pay the LLC $375,000 prior to November 30, 2016 and $519,000 on or before February 1, 2017 for consulting
services provided and to be provided. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company accrued commissions
payable of $318,000. Of the $318,000 amount accrued, $91,666 was recognized as commissions expense- related party for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the remaining $226,334 was recorded as deferred commissions as of
September 30, 2016, as amounts owed but not yet earned.

Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

The following
is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating
results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as well as information relating to
the plans of our current management. This report includes forward-looking statements. Generally, the words  believes, 
 anticipates,   may,   will,   should,   expect,   intend, 
 estimate,   continue,  and similar expressions or the negative thereof or comparable terminology are
intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the
matters set forth in this report or other reports or documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to
time, which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those projected. Undue reliance should not be placed
on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking
statements.    

The following
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, filed with the Company s Registration Statement
on Form S-1/A with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 15, 2016.  

This discussion
should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion
reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future.  

While our financial
statements are presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time, our independent auditor s report on our
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 includes a  going concern  explanatory paragraph
that describes substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to the factors
prompting the explanatory paragraph are discussed below and also in Note 8 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

sell hearing aid instruments and related devices to MFHC on a per store basis. MFHC owned and operated retail hearing aid stores.
Based on common control of MFHC and the Company, all transactions with MFHC are classified as related party transactions.  

On
August 5, 2016, the Company along with Mark Moore ( Mark , the Company s chairman), Matthew
Moore ( Matthew , the Company s Chief Executive Officer) and Kim Moore ( Kim , the
Company s Chief Financial Officer) entered into a Store Expansion Consulting Agreement (the  Expansion

party s retail locations during the initial term of the six-month Agreement, in the Northern California
area.  

Also
on August 5, 2016, the Company and the Moores entered into a Consulting Agreement (the  Consulting Agreement )
with the same company. Under the Consulting Agreement, including the Non-Compete provision covering a ten mile radius of any
of the party s retail stores, the Company and the Moores will provide unlimited licensing of Intela-Hear brand name,
exclusive access to the Aware aural rehab program within 10 miles of  retail stores, exclusive territory of all services
within 10 miles of the retail stores and 40 hours per month of various consulting services. The Consulting Agreement
continues until January 31, 2019, unless terminated for cause, as defined in the Consulting Agreement.  

Effective
August 5, 2016, the Company entered into a Marketing Agreement (the  Marketing Agreement ). Pursuant to the
Marketing Agreement, the Company will provide marketing concepts and designs to promote  the contracting party s
products and use the Company s advertising services for an initial six month period. Pursuant to the Marketing

Agreement may be renewed for additional six month periods, and either party may terminate the Marketing Agreement by

Results of
Operations   

For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues   

  Revenues
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $689,818 and $1,312,063, respectively, compared to $219,597 and $644,668
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

The
revenue increase was primarily the result of the Marketing and Consulting agreements  as well as the direct print
and mail advertising services. A breakdown of the net increase in sales is as follows:  

Related
Party    

On August
5, 2016, in consideration of $128,000 (the  Cancellation Fee ), MFHC and the Company agreed to cancel the Marketing
Agreement as a result of the sale by MFHC of substantially all of their assets. Prior to the sale, MFHC
stores increased from 18 as of January 1, 2015 to 20 as August 5, 2016. The Company charged MHFC $3,200 per store per month effective
January 1, 2014. Beginning April 1, 2016, through August 5, 2016, the Company also provided direct print and mail advertising
services to MFHC.  

Other    

Consulting   

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, pursuant to the Consulting Agreement the Company recorded consulting
income of $152,777. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded design and marketing consulting
income of $93,548 related to the Marketing Agreement.  

Direct
print, mail service and miscellaneous   

During the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company developed marketing materials including printing and mailing services
for direct marketing campaigns and the sale of accessory products and recorded revenues of $148,718.  

Cost
of sales   

The Company
records the costs of designing, producing, printing and mailing advertisements for our client s direct mail marketing campaigns
in cost of sales as well as the licensing of telemarketing software. Cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2016 follows:  

The increase
in related party cost of sales was as a result of beginning April 1, 2016, through August 5, 2016, the Company incurred the costs
pursuant to the direct print and mail advertising services provided to MFHC. Other costs increased for the costs incurred pursuant
to the direct print and mail advertising services provided to other customers.  

Operating
Expenses   

Operating
expenses increased to $293,589 and $682,865 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $142,212 and $434,462
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in expenses in the current periods was as follows:  

Compensation
and benefits increased in the current three and nine month periods as a result of the Company effective August 1, 2016, compensating
the CEO and CFO at an annual rate of $225,000 and $125,000, respectively as well as increased personnel costs related to telemarketing
services on behalf of our customers.  

Professional
fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $27,785 and $92,734, respectively, compared to $17,166 and $42,692
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Professional consisted of:   

Commissions,
stockholder, are the result of the Company recording  commission due on all amounts recognized as revenue in the period
related to the Consulting Agreement and Store Expansion Agreement.  

Rent, related
party, decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015 as a result of the sublease agreement with MFHC entered into on February 1, 2016 being terminated on April 30, 2016,
which effectively decreased the monthly rent cost by $4,026. The Company expects monthly rent to be $1,500 per month for the remainder
of 2016.   

General
and administrative costs increased to $20,582 and $28,490 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively,
compared to $5,259 and $11,814 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and is comprised of the following:  

Transfer
agent and filing fees increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, for expenses related to Company s
common stock to begin trading as a DTC eligible entity.  

Net Income   

Net income
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $90,743 and $61,443, respectively, compared to net income of $42,762
and $104,802 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of the increases in revenues being greater than
the increases in costs as described above.  

Capital
Resources and Liquidity   

Liquidity
is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs to pay ongoing obligations. As of September
30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $261,486, an increase of $193,645, from $67,841 as of December 31, 2015. At September
30, 2016, we had current liabilities of $864,646 (including deferred revenues of $377,223) compared to current assets of $1,092,865
which resulted in working capital of $228,219. The current liabilities are comprised of accounts payable, accrued expenses and
deferred revenue.  

For the
next twelve months, we expect to be able to meet our cash needed for our current operations from the revenues we receive from
providing advertising and marketing services to our clients and the cash pursuant to the Expansion Agreement and Consulting
Agreement. In the first or second calendar quarter of 2017 we are planning to launch the Alliance program. Management
estimates it will need approximately $100,000 to launch the Alliance program. Our ability to operate beyond December, 2016,
is contingent upon continuing to realize sales revenue sufficient to fund our ongoing expenses as well as the cash from  the
Consulting Agreement. If we are unable to sustain our ongoing operations through sales revenue, we intend to fund operations
through debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund our working capital, or other cash
requirements. We do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for the sales of stock or the advancement or loan of
funds at this time. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or
at all.  

Operating
Activities   

Cash provided
in operating activities was $193,645 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash provided from operations of
$83,008 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the cash provided from operations
was a result of the net income of $61,443, a decrease of $80,800 in the amounts due from MFHC (related party), an increase in
accounts payable and accrued expenses of $34,192, an increase in deferred revenue of $377,223, an increase in accrued officer
salaries of $58,333 and an increase in commissions payable stockholder of $318,000; partially offset by increases of; $441,000
for advances to related parties, $45,707 in prepaid assets, $226,334 in deferred commissions stockholder, increase in accounts
receivable of $68,614 and an increase in inventory of $9,486.  

OFF BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

We do not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition
or results of operations.  

Going concern  

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had net income of $61,443 and generated cash of $193,645 from
operations, primarily as a result of activities with MFHC (related party) and the Consulting, Marketing and Store Expansion Agreements.
The contract with MFHC was cancelled on August 5, 2016, and the Company is now dependent on the aforementioned agreements.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Critical Accounting
Policies   

Basis of presentation  

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States
of America ( US GAAP ). The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the consolidated accounts of Innerscope
and its  wholly owned subsidiaries ILLC and Intela-Hear, a California limited liability company. All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   

Use of estimates  

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Revenue
Recognition  

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that four basic criteria are
met (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of products and services has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed
or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue during the period in which the services
are performed. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $246,325 into revenue related to
the Marketing and Consulting Agreements.  During the same periods the Company recognized zero revenue related
to the Store Expansion agreement.  

Deferred
Revenue  

The
Company records deferred revenues from the Store Expansion and Consulting Agreements when cash has been received, but the related
services have not been provided. Deferred revenue will be recognized when the services are provided and the terms of the agreements
have been fulfilled. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has deferred revenue of $377,223 related to the Consulting and Expansion
agreements.  

Income taxes  

The Company uses
the liability method of accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance can be provided for a net deferred tax asset, due to uncertainty
of realization.  

Net income per common share  

Net loss per
common share is computed pursuant to ASC No. 260  Earnings Per Share.  Basic net income per share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share
is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares
of common stock during each period. There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    

Not applicable
to smaller reporting companies.  

Item 4. Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due to control deficiencies. During the period we did not have additional personnel
to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. The Company does not have an Audit Committee
to oversee management activities, and the Company is dependent on third party consultants for the financial reporting function.  

Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting    

There were no
changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required
by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

Part II.  Other Information

 Legal Proceedings   

We are not a
party to any material litigation, nor, to the knowledge of management, is any litigation threatened against us that may materially
affect us.

  2.  Consulting
Services .  

  (a)  General
Service Commitments . During the Consulting Period, Consultant shall provide consulting services as requested by the
Company (collectively,   Services  ). The Parties agree that both Consultant and the Moores shall be
available to the Company on an exclusive basis, and that neither the Consultant nor the Moores shall work as a consultant or
otherwise within the Business (as defined below) during the Consulting Period, except for the Company (the Parties agree that
any such work would be a conflict of interest). All Services provided to the Company under this Agreement shall be performed
by each of Mark, Matthew and Kim personally, unless the Company gives written permission to the Consultant for someone other
than the Moores to perform the Services. The Consultant and the Moores, in rendering Services, agree to comply with all sales
and marketing policies of the Company and its Affiliates, to the extent applicable to the Services, as such policies may be
amended from time to time. The term  Business  as used in this Agreement, means the service of dispensing and
fitting hearing aids and operating hearing aid dispensing centers. Services hereunder shall in no event include providing any
medical advice to patients or other end-users of hearing aids or other products of the Company.    

(b)  Supervision .
The Moores possess unique skills and knowledge, and the Company is retaining Consultant to obtain and receive these unique
skills and knowledge in the performance of Services. Accordingly, the Company shall not directly supervise the Moores as they
provide the Services; provided, however, that Consultant s work for the Company shall conform to this Section
2.  

(c)  Reporting;
Best Efforts . During the Consulting Period, Consultant will report to the President of the Company, or to such other
Company executives as may be designated by the Company. The Moores, while rendering Services on behalf of Consultant, will
devote their best efforts to the business and affairs of the Company. The Moores, through the Consultant, will render all
Services to the best of their ability in a diligent, timely, trustworthy, businesslike and efficient manner.  

(d)  Hours
of Work . Other than scheduled appointments, meetings, telephone conferences and other scheduled events, the Consultant
may determine its own hours of work in performing Services, and the Consultant may perform Services out of the Moores 
own homes, rather than working out of the Company s offices.  

  (e)  Private
Pay . To the extent possible, Consultant shall limit marketing efforts to patients who are not enrolled in a Medicaid
managed care plan or other federally funded healthcare program.  

  (f)  Additional
Services . The Company may reasonably expand or limit the Services under this Agreement; provided, however, that any
expansion of services shall be consistent with the Services, as defined in this Agreement.  

  (g)  No
Sub-Contracting . Because the Moores  expertise and knowledge is unique, all Services shall be performed by the
Moores alone, and Consultant may not sub-contract any work under this Agreement.

responsibility for paying any taxes due on fees received from the Company, to the extent any taxes may be due and owing, and
shall maintain appropriate records of payments. The Company shall issue 1099 forms to the Moores as required by
law.  

  (e)  No
Company Group Insurance . The Consultant acknowledges that the Moores will not be eligible for the Company s group
insurance benefits, such as health insurance, and that they are responsible for making arrangements for their own personal
insurance coverage.  

  4.  Termination .  

  (a)
Notwithstanding Section 1 of this Agreement, the Company may terminate the consulting relationship for Cause (as defined
below). No advance notice of termination need be provided by the Company in the event of a termination for Cause, other than
associated with applicable  cure  periods.  

  (b)
For purposes of this Agreement:  

   Cause 
will mean (i) the Moores  commission of a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude or any other act or omission involving
misappropriation, fraud or breach of fiduciary duty by the Moores, (ii) serious misconduct by the Moores with respect to the Company
or any of its Affiliates in the performance of the Moores  duties hereunder, (iii) unsatisfactory performance which is not
remedied by Consultant within 10 days after written notice thereof to Consultant, or (iv) any other material breach of this Agreement

agrees that they will use Confidential Information only as necessary and only in connection with the performance of Services
(the Company specifically agrees that, as a permitted necessary use, the Consultant may share Confidential Information with
their legal counselors, and tax advisors, as long as such advisors agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information,
and that the Consultant may also include Confidential Information in tax filings). Consultant agrees that they will not
disclose to any unauthorized Person or use for their own or any other purposes (except as described in the immediately
preceding sentence) any Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Company, unless and to the extent
that (a) the Confidential Information becomes generally known to and available for use by the public, or becomes generally
known to and available within the Company s industry, other than as a result of Consultant s acts or omissions or
(b) Consultant is ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to disclose Confidential Information, provided that in such
circumstance Consultant must (i) provide prompt written notice to the Company of any relevant process or pleadings that could
lead to such an order and (ii) reasonably cooperate with the Company at the Company s expense to contest, object to or
limit such a request and, in any case, when revealing such Confidential Information pursuant to such court order.  

  6. 
 Work Product; Intellectual Property . Consultant acknowledges and agrees that all intellectual property, methods, analyses,
service marks, writings, audiovisual works, goodwill and tradenames, which relate to the Company or any of its Affiliates 
actual or anticipated business which are conceived, developed or made by Consultant while performing Services during the Consulting
Period pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the   Work Product  ) belong to the Company or such Affiliate.
All Work Product created by Consultant during the Consulting Period, relating to the business of the Company or its potential
businesses, will be considered  work made for hire,  and as such, the Company is the sole owner of all rights, title,
and interests therein. Consultant will promptly disclose and deliver such Work Product to the Company and, at the Company s
expense, perform all actions reasonably requested by the Company (whether during or after the Consulting Period) to establish,
confirm, document, perfect, record, and protect such ownership. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, nothing in this Section
6 is intended to confer upon the Company or its Affiliates any intellectual property rights or other rights in inventions or other
work product developed by Consultant prior to the date of this Agreement or outside of the Services to be provided hereunder.

Services that they have, and will continue to, become familiar with the Company s and its Affiliates  trade secrets,

and their customers and suppliers and that the Moores  services have been and will be of special, unique and extraordinary
value to the Company and its Affiliates. The Moores agree that, so long as the Moores are providing Services and continuing for
24 months thereafter, the Moores will not, directly or indirectly, anywhere in the Applicable Area (whether on their own account,
or as a consultant, agent, partner, manager, joint venturer, owner, operator or officer of any other Person, or in the case of
the Moores, as an employee, or in any other manner): (i) act in a capacity, or provide services, similar to those that the Moores
acted in or provided for the Company, for any other business that is, directly or indirectly, engaged in the Business; (ii) supervise,
manage or oversee others engaging, directly or indirectly, in the Business, or manage, control, participate in, provide financing
to, consult with, or render services for, any other Person that, directly or indirectly, engages in the Business; or (iii) directly
or indirectly have any ownership interest (whether as proprietor, partner, member, stockholder or otherwise) in any business (regardless
of the form in which conducted) which is, directly or indirectly, engaged in the Business; provided, nothing herein will prohibit
the Moores from being a passive owner of not more than 1% of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly
traded, and nothing herein will prohibit the Moores from passive investments in any privately held corporation or other entity
which does not engage in the Business. The term  Applicable Area  means a 10 mile radius of any of the existing clinics
of the Company, which are listed on Exhibit B hereof, (2) the clinics or retail stores purchased by the Company pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement and (3) the clinics or retail stores opened by Consultant pursuant to this Agreement.  

  (b)

may hire former employees and consultants to the Company and Affiliates after such former personnel have ceased to be employed
or otherwise engaged by the Company or any of its Affiliates for a period of at least 12 months, and further provided, that nothing
in this Section 7(b) is intended to prohibit the Moores from making solicitations in media of general circulation that are not
targeted at employees of the Company or any of its Affiliates.  

  (c) 
The Moores acknowledge and agree that the restrictions contained in this Section 7 with respect to time, geographical area, and
scope of activity are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other legitimate
business interests of the Company and its Affiliates and that the Moores has had the opportunity to review the provisions of this
Agreement with legal counsel. In particular, the Moores agree and acknowledge that the Company is now or will be engaging in the
Business and actively marketing its services and products within the Business throughout the Applicable Area, that the Company
and its Affiliates expend significant time and effort developing and protecting the confidentiality of their methods of doing
business, technology, customer lists, long term customer relationships and trade secrets and such methods, technology, customer
lists, customer relationships and trade secrets have significant value. The existence of any claim or cause of action by the Moores
against the Company or any of its Affiliates, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense
to the enforcement by the Company of the provisions of Sections 5, 6 or this Section 7, which Sections will be enforceable notwithstanding
the existence of any breach by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Moores will not be prohibited from pursuing such
claims or causes of action against the Company.  

  (d)

Company and any of its Affiliates, in addition and supplementary to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor, may

of a breach of this Agreement or to enjoin any breach of this Agreement and (ii) prevails in such action or proceeding, then the
non-prevailing Party will, in addition to any other rights and remedies available to such Party, reimburse the prevailing Party

payments.

a  separation from service  under Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations
that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement comply with Section 409A and in no event shall the Company be liable
for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest, or other expenses that may be incurred by the Executive on account of
non-compliance with Section 409A.  

(b) Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, if at the time of the Executive's termination of employment, the Executive is a  specified
employee , determined in accordance with Section 409A, any payments and benefits provided under this Agreement that constitute
 nonqualified deferred compensation  subject to Section 409A (e.g., payments and benefits that do not qualify as a short-term
deferral or as a separation pay exception) that are provided to the Executive on account of the Executive s separation from
service shall not be paid until the first payroll date to occur following the six-month anniversary of the Executive's termination
date (  Specified Employee Payment Date  ). The aggregate amount of any payments that would otherwise have been
made during such six-month period shall be paid in a lump sum on the Specified Employee Payment Date without interest and thereafter,

six-month period, any delayed payments shall be paid to the Executive's estate in a lump sum upon the Executive's death.

eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year;  

(ii) any
reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be paid to the Executive on or before the last day of the calendar year following the
calendar year in which the expense was incurred; and

right to reimbursements or in-kind benefits under this Agreement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  

(d) In
the event the Company determines that the Executive is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i)
of the Code at the time of the Executive s separation from service, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Executive
becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of the Executive s separation from service would be considered deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such payment shall
not be payable and such benefit shall not be provided until the date that is the earlier of (i) six months and one day after the
Executive s separation from service, or (ii) the Executive s death (the  Six Month Delay Rule ).  

(i) For
purposes of this subparagraph, amounts payable under the Agreement should not provide for a deferral of compensation subject to
Section 409A to the extent provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) (e.g., short-term deferrals), Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) (e.g., separation pay plans, including the exception under subparagraph (iii)), and other applicable provisions
of the Treasury Regulations.  

(ii)
To the extent that the Six Month Delay Rule applies to payments otherwise payable on an installment basis, the first payment
shall include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for the
application of the Six Month Delay Rule, and the balance of the installments shall be payable in accordance with their
original schedule.  

(iii) To
the extent that the Six Month Delay Rule applies to the provision of benefits (including, but not limited to, life insurance and
medical insurance), such benefit coverage shall nonetheless be provided to the Executive during the first six months following
his separation from service (the  Six Month Period ), provided that, during such Six-Month Period, the Executive pays
to the Company, on a monthly basis in advance, an amount equal to the Monthly Cost (as defined below) of such benefit coverage.
The Company shall reimburse the Executive for any such payments made by the Executive in a lump sum not later than 30 days following
the sixth month anniversary of the Executive s separation from service. For purposes of this subparagraph,  Monthly
Cost  means the minimum dollar amount which, if paid by the Executive on a monthly basis in advance, results in the Executive
not being required to recognize any federal income tax on receipt of the benefit coverage during the Six Month Period.  

(e) The
parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A. To the extent that any provision of this
Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A, the provision shall be read in such a manner so that all payments
hereunder comply with Section 409A. The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party,
and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments
and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party.  

(f) The
Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions
of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A but do not satisfy an exemption from,
or the conditions of, such Section.

The Company hereby employs the Executive, and the Executive hereby accepts employment with the Company as an  at
will  employee, commencing as of the Effective Date and continuing until terminated either by the Company or the
Executive. Executive and Company acknowledge and understand that as an  at will  employee, Executive and/or
Company may terminate this Employment Agreement with or without cause, provided the terminating party gives at least 90 days
notice of their intent to terminate this Agreement. This 90-day notice requirement is not binding upon Company if Executive
commits acts of malfeasance as further discussed in Section 6..  

  (b)    Continuing
Effect . Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, at the end of the Term or otherwise, the provisions of
Sections 6(e), 7, 8, 9, 11 14, 17, 18, and 22 shall remain in full force and effect and the provisions of Section 8 shall be
binding upon the legal representatives, successors and assigns of the Executive.  

  3.    Duties .  

  (a)    General
Duties . The Executive shall serve as CFO and Treasurer of the Company, with duties and responsibilities that are
customary for such an executive. The Executive shall also perform such other duties as shall be reasonably determined from
time to time by the BOD and such services for such subsidiaries of the Company as may be necessary. The Executive shall use
her best efforts to perform her duties and discharge her responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement competently, carefully
and faithfully.   

  (b)    Devotion
of Time . Subject to the last two sentences of this Section 3(b), Executive shall devote a reasonable amount of her
business time, attention and energies to the affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates as are necessary to
perform her duties and responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. The Executive shall not enter the employ of or serve as a
consultant to (other than the agreements with Helix Care (California), Inc. ( Helix ), or in any way perform any
services with or without compensation to, any other persons, business, or organization, without the prior consent of the BOD
or the shareholders. Notwithstanding the above, the Executive shall be permitted to devote a limited amount of her time, to
professional, charitable or similar organizations, including serving as a non-executive director or an advisor to a BOD,
committee of any company or organization provided that such activities are not directly or indirectly in conflict with the
business of the Company and/or do not interfere with the Executive s performance of her duties and responsibilities as
provided hereunder. If any of these activities present a direct or indirect conflict of interest, Executive shall obtain the
permission of the BOD or the shareholders.  

  (c)    Location
of Office . The Executive s principal business office shall be in the Company s offices in Roseville,
California or such other location as shall be mutually agreeable to the Executive and the Company. Executive is not required
to perform her job duties at the Company s offices, but shall work at the Company s offices as needed to
supervise the Company s employees and ensure the success of the Company.  

  (d)
   Adherence to Inside Information Policies . The Executive acknowledges
that the Company is publicly-held and, as a result, has implemented inside information policies designed to preclude its executives
and those of its subsidiaries from violating the federal securities laws by trading on material, non-public information or passing
such information on to others in breach of any duty owed to the Company, or any third party. The Executive shall promptly execute
any agreements generally distributed by the Company to its employees requiring such employees to abide by its inside information
policies. Executive agrees that prior to selling more than 5% of her stock holdings in any single day, Executive shall consult
with the Company s counsel to ensure compliance with Securities laws.  

  4.    Compensation
and Expenses .  

  (a)    Salary .
For the services of the Executive to be rendered under this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Executive an annual salary
of $125,000 (the  Base Salary ), less such deductions as shall be required to be withheld by applicable law and
regulations payable in accordance with the Company s customary payroll practices.   

  (b)    Bonus .
The Executive is eligible to participate in any bonus plan the BOD implements.  

  (c)    Expenses  (a) .
In addition to any compensation received pursuant to this Section 4, the Company will reimburse or advance funds to the
Executive for all reasonable documented travel, entertainment and miscellaneous expenses incurred in connection with the
performance of her duties under this Agreement,  provided  that the Executive properly provides a written accounting of
such expenses to the Company in accordance with the Company s practices.   Such reimbursement or advances will be
made in accordance with policies and procedures of the Company in effect from time to time relating to reimbursement of, or
advances to, its executive officers.  

  5.    Benefits .  

  (a)  Paid
Time Off . As an executive, time off will not be governed or restricted. The Executive shall take reasonable amounts of time
off according to her discretion and with the full consent and approval of the BOD,   provided
that such activities do not interfere with the Executive s performance of her duties and responsibilities as provided hereunder .
Executive is well aware that he will be available to the Company while on time off (by cell phone and e-mail whenever logistically
possible) and will be willing to prematurely end time off as the needs of the Company may dictate (whenever logistically possible).   

(b)   Employee
Benefit Programs . The Executive is entitled to participate in any pension, 401(k), insurance or other employee benefit
plan that is maintained by the Company for its executives, including programs of life insurance, health insurance and
reimbursement of membership fees in professional organizations. All such benefit programs shall be approved by the
BOD.  

6.    Termination .  

  (a)   In
the event of termination of employment by the Company without Cause, the Executive shall be immediately entitled to one
month of salary for every two months worked, up to a maximum of 18 paid months as severance, less all amounts of salary and
cash bonus payments previously received under this Agreement. Such severance shall be paid by the Company at the same times
as it pays its executives. Executive acknowledges and understands that said payments shall cease or be limited to the
difference in Executive s salary with Company and new employer upon Executive finding new employment. For example,
should Executive find new employment paying $100,000 per year, Executive shall only be entitled to $125,000 for each month
Executive is entitled to severance payment. Executive further acknowledges and agrees that Executive is obligated to make
reasonable and good faith efforts to find new employment upon severance payments commencing. Failure to make such reasonable
and good faith efforts by Executive give Company the option, but not the obligation, to discontinue such severance
payments.  

  (b)    Termination
for Cause.  In the event Executive is terminated for Cause, the Company may terminate this Agreement, and the Executive
shall have no right to compensation, severance as defined in Section 6(a) or reimbursement for expenses not directly related
to the benefit of the Company, or to participate in any Executive benefit programs under Section 5, except as may otherwise
be provided for by law, for any period subsequent to the effective date of termination. For purposes of this Agreement,
 Cause  shall mean: (i) the Executive is convicted of, or pleads guilty or nolo contendere to, any felony
(including, but not limited to, any felony involving fraud, moral turpitude, embezzlement or theft in connection with the

carrying out her duties hereunder, has acted with gross negligence or intentional misconduct resulting, in any case, in harm

resolution adopted by the Company s BOD at a meeting in which the Executive was offered a reasonable opportunity to
argue that the resolution should not be adopted; or (x) the Executive abuses alcohol or drugs in a manner that interferes
with the successful performance of her duties; (xi) the Executive fails to perform her duties under the Agreement by the
Executive for any reason other than Section 6(c) of this Agreement.   

  (c)    Death
or Disability . Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the
death or disability of the Executive. For purposes of this Section 6(a),  disability  shall mean (i) the

totally disabled by the Social Security Administration. Any question as to the existence of a disability shall be determined
by the written opinion of the Executive s regularly attending physician (or her guardian) (or the Social Security
Administration, where applicable). In the event that the Executive s employment is terminated by reason of
Executive s death or disability, the Company shall pay the following to the Executive or her personal representative:
(i) any accrued but unpaid Base Salary for services rendered to the date of termination and (ii) any accrued but unpaid
expenses required to be reimbursed under this Agreement.

date be some date beyond the date of termination notice, the Executive shall be entitled to only the following:

Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(A)).    

   (3)
In the event of a Change of Control during the Term, the Executive shall be entitled to receive each of the provisions
of Section 6(d)(2)(A)   (D) above except the benefits under Section 6(d)(2)(D) shall continue for a three month period

requesting equitable or declaratory relief. Company and Executive agree that no action for money damages, regardless of the nature
of the claim being contractual or in tort, may be maintained in State or Federal Courts, and the only venue for such actions requesting
money damages is arbitration.  

  (b) Any
action permitted to be filed in the State or Federal Courts pursuant to Section 9(a) must be commenced only in the appropriate
state or federal court located in Placer County, California. The Executive and the Company irrevocably and unconditionally submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and agree to take any and all future action necessary to submit to the jurisdiction
of such courts. The Executive and the Company irrevocably waive any objection that they now have or hereafter may have to the
laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and further irrevocably waive any claim that any such
suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Final judgment against the Executive
or the Company in any such suit shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment, a certified
or true copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and the amount of any liability of the Executive or the Company
therein described, or by appropriate proceedings under any applicable treaty or otherwise.  

  10.
   Conflicts of Interest . While employed by the Company, the
Executive shall not, unless approved by the BOD or the shareholders of the Company, directly or indirectly:  

  (a) participate
as an individual in any way in the benefits of transactions with any of the Company s suppliers, vendors, customers, or
subjects, including, without limitation, having a financial interest in the Company s suppliers, vendors, customers, or
subjects, or making loans to, or receiving loans, from, the Company s suppliers, vendors, customers, or subjects;  

  (b) realize
a personal gain or advantage from a transaction in which the Company has an interest or use information obtained in connection

  (c) accept
any offer to serve as an officer, director, partner, consultant, manager with, or to be employed in a professional, medical, technical,
or managerial capacity by, a person or entity which does business with the Company.  

  11.
   Inventions, Ideas, Processes, and Designs . All inventions,
ideas, processes, programs, software, and designs (including all improvements) (i) conceived or made by the Executive during the
course of her employment with the Company (whether or not actually conceived during regular business hours), and (ii) related
to the business of the Company, shall be deemed works made for hire and shall be disclosed in writing promptly to the Company
and shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and the Executive hereby assigns any such inventions to the Company.
An invention, idea, process, program, software, or design (including an improvement) shall be deemed related to the business of
the Company if (a) it was made with the Company s funds, personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, or Confidential Information,
(b) results from work performed by the Executive for the Company, or (c) pertains to the current business or demonstrably anticipated
research or development work of the Company. The Executive shall cooperate with the Company and its attorneys in the preparation
of patent and copyright applications for such developments and, upon request, shall promptly assign all such inventions, ideas,
processes, and designs to the Company. The decision to file for patent or copyright protection or to maintain such development
as a trade secret, or otherwise, shall be in the sole discretion of the Company, and the Executive shall be bound by such decision.
The Executive hereby irrevocably assigns to the Company, for no additional consideration, the Executive s entire right,
title and interest in and to all work product and intellectual property rights described by the first sentence of this Section
11, including the right to sue, counterclaim and recover for all past, present and future infringement, misappropriation or dilution
thereof, and all rights corresponding thereto throughout the world. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to
reduce or limit the Company's rights, title or interest in any work product or intellectual property rights so as to be less in
any respect than the Company would have had in the absence of this Agreement.  Exhibit A  to this Agreement contains a non-exclusive
list of inventions, ideas, processes, and designs which the Executive made or conceived prior to her employment with the Company
and which therefore are excluded from the scope of this Agreement. References to the Company in this Section 11 shall include
the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates.  

  12.
   Indebtedness . If, during the course of the Executive s
employment under this Agreement, the Executive becomes indebted to the Company for any reason, the Company may, if it so elects,
and if permitted by applicable law, set off any sum due to the Company from the Executive and collect any remaining balance from
the Executive unless the Executive has entered into a written agreement with the Company.  

  13.
   Assignability . The rights and obligations of the Company
under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Company, provided that
such successor or assign shall acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets and business of the Company. The Executive s
obligations hereunder may not be assigned or alienated and any attempt to do so by the Executive will be void.  

  14.
   Severability .  

  (a) If,
in any adversarial proceeding, including arbitration, the arbitrator or judge shall refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants
deemed included herein because taken together they are more extensive than necessary to assure to the Company the intended benefits
of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed by the parties hereto that the provisions of this Agreement that, if
eliminated, would permit the remaining separate provisions to be enforced in such proceeding shall be deemed eliminated, for the
purposes of such proceeding, from this Agreement.  

  (b) If
any provision of this Agreement otherwise is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable or is prohibited by the laws of the state or
jurisdiction where it is to be performed, this Agreement shall be considered divisible as to such provision and such provision
shall be inoperative in such state or jurisdiction and shall not be part of the consideration moving from either of the parties
to the other. The remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be valid and binding and of like effect as though such provisions
were not included.  

  15.
   Notices and Addresses . All notices, offers, acceptance and
any other acts under this Agreement (except payment) shall be in writing, and shall be sufficiently given if delivered to the
addressees in person, by FedEx or similar receipted delivery, or next business day delivery to the addresses detailed below (or
to such other address, as either of them, by notice to the other may designate from time to time), or by e-mail delivery (in which
event a copy shall immediately be sent by FedEx or similar receipted delivery), as follows:  

16.
   Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
The execution of this Agreement may be by actual or facsimile signature.  

  17.
   Attorneys  Fees . In the event that there is any controversy
or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or to the interpretation, breach or enforcement thereof, and any action
or proceeding is commenced to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys 
fees, costs and expenses (including such fees and costs on appeal).  

  18.
   Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed or interpreted
according to the internal laws of the State of California without regard to choice of law considerations and all claims relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall also be governed
by the laws of the State of California without regard to choice of law considerations.  

  19.
   Entire Agreement . This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement
between the parties and supersedes all prior oral and written agreements between the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, except
by a statement in writing signed by the party or parties against which enforcement or the change, waiver discharge or termination
is sought.  

  20.
   Section and Paragraph Headings . The section and paragraph
headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  

  21.
   Arbitration . Any dispute, claim
or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity
thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration
in Placer County, California before one arbitrator. The parties to arbitration shall jointly select an arbitrator. The arbitration
shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited
Procedures delineated in Rule 16.1 and 16.2. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and conclusive, and the parties waive
the right to trial  de novo  or appeal, excepting only for the purpose of confirming the arbitrator's decision, for which
purpose the Parties agree the California Superior Court shall have jurisdiction. The party asserting any breach will have the
burden of proof with respect thereto.  

  22.
    Section 409A Compliance .  

   (a) This
Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ( Section 409A ),
or an exemption thereunder. This Agreement shall be construed and administered in accordance with Section 409A. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, payments provided under this Agreement may only be made upon an event and
in a manner that complies with Section 409A or an applicable exemption. Any payments under this Agreement that may be excluded
from Section 409A either as separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service (including a voluntary separation from
service for good reason that is considered an involuntary separation for purposes of the separation pay exception under Treasury
Regulation 1.409A-1(n)(2)) or as a short-term deferral shall be excluded from Section 409A to the maximum extent possible. For
purposes of Section 409A, each installment payment provided under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment. Any payments
to be made under this Agreement upon a termination of employment shall only be made if such termination of employment constitutes
a  separation from service  under Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations
that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement comply with Section 409A and in no event shall the Company be liable
for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest, or other expenses that may be incurred by the Executive on account of
non-compliance with Section 409A.  

(b) Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, if at the time of the Executive's termination of employment, the Executive is a  specified
employee , determined in accordance with Section 409A, any payments and benefits provided under this Agreement that constitute
 nonqualified deferred compensation  subject to Section 409A (e.g., payments and benefits that do not qualify as a short-term
deferral or as a separation pay exception) that are provided to the Executive on account of the Executive s separation from
service shall not be paid until the first payroll date to occur following the six-month anniversary of the Executive's termination
date (  Specified Employee Payment Date  ). The aggregate amount of any payments that would otherwise have been
made during such six-month period shall be paid in a lump sum on the Specified Employee Payment Date without interest and thereafter,
any remaining payments shall be paid without delay in accordance with their original schedule. If the Executive dies during the
six-month period, any delayed payments shall be paid to the Executive's estate in a lump sum upon the Executive's death.  

(c) To
the extent required by Section 409A, each reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided under this Agreement shall be provided in
accordance with the following:  

(i) the
amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during each calendar year cannot affect the expenses
eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year;  

(ii) any
reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be paid to the Executive on or before the last day of the calendar year following the
calendar year in which the expense was incurred; and  

(iii) any
right to reimbursements or in-kind benefits under this Agreement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  

(d) In
the event the Company determines that the Executive is a  specified employee  within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i)
of the Code at the time of the Executive s separation from service, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Executive
becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of the Executive s separation from service would be considered deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such payment shall
not be payable and such benefit shall not be provided until the date that is the earlier of (i) six months and one day after the
Executive s separation from service, or (ii) the Executive s death (the  Six Month Delay Rule ).  

(i) For
purposes of this subparagraph, amounts payable under the Agreement should not provide for a deferral of compensation subject to
Section 409A to the extent provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) (e.g., short-term deferrals), Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) (e.g., separation pay plans, including the exception under subparagraph (iii)), and other applicable provisions
of the Treasury Regulations.  

(ii) To
the extent that the Six Month Delay Rule applies to payments otherwise payable on an installment basis, the first payment shall
include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for the application
of the Six Month Delay Rule, and the balance of the installments shall be payable in accordance with their original schedule.  

(iii) To
the extent that the Six Month Delay Rule applies to the provision of benefits (including, but not limited to, life insurance and
medical insurance), such benefit coverage shall nonetheless be provided to the Executive during the first six months following
her separation from service (the  Six Month Period ), provided that, during such Six-Month Period, the Executive pays
to the Company, on a monthly basis in advance, an amount equal to the Monthly Cost (as defined below) of such benefit coverage.
The Company shall reimburse the Executive for any such payments made by the Executive in a lump sum not later than 30 days following
the sixth month anniversary of the Executive s separation from service. For purposes of this subparagraph,  Monthly
Cost  means the minimum dollar amount which, if paid by the Executive on a monthly basis in advance, results in the Executive
not being required to recognize any federal income tax on receipt of the benefit coverage during the Six Month Period.  

(e) The
parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A. To the extent that any provision of this
Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A, the provision shall be read in such a manner so that all payments
hereunder comply with Section 409A. The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party,
and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments
and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party.  

(f) The
Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions
of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A but do not satisfy an exemption from,
or the conditions of, such Section.
