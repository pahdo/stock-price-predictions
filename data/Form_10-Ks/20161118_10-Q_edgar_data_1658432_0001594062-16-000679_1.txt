Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash and all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less. 

The Company maintains its cash accounts primarily with banks located in Singapore and they are all denominated in Singapore dollar. 

Accounts Receivable  

Accounts receivable consist primarily of receivables from provided services. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. On a continuing basis, management analyzes delinquent receivables, and once these receivables are determined to be uncollectible, they are written off against an existing allowance account. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company has determined that an allowance for doubtful accounts is not necessary as all accounts are considered fully collectible. 

Inventories  

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using weighted average cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis.  Inventories on hand are evaluated on an on-going basis to determine if any items are obsolete or in excess of future needs. Items determined to be obsolete are reserved for. The Company provides for the possible inability to sell its inventories by providing an excess inventory reserve. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company determined that no reserve was required. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.  Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.  Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the account and any gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations. 

Estimated useful lives for computer are 1 ~ 3 years, useful lives for dental equipment, furniture and fittings, and office equipment are 3 ~ 5 years and useful lives for renovations are the lessor of 3 years or the lease term.  

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets whenever significant events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate, based on management s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time, to the carrying amount of the assets. If the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows, the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.  No such impairment was indicated at September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments Estimates  

The Company s financial instruments including accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued and other payables and due to related parties are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The recorded value of the Company s long-term debt approximates its fair value as it bears interest at a floating rate. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk  

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk include cash. At times, the Company maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. Management monitors the credit rating and concentration of risk with these financial institutions on a continuing basis to mitigate risk. 

Taxes Collected and Remitted to Governmental Authorities  

The Company reports taxes collected from customers, which are primarily goods and service tax, on a net basis. 

Revenue Recognition  

Revenues are recognized when services are rendered, amounts are reliably measurable, and collectability is assured.  Revenue is presented, net of goods and services tax, rebates and discounts. 

Advertising  

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.   Advertising costs were immaterial for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Income Taxes  

Current income tax liabilities for current and prior years are recognized at the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities, using the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. 

Deferred income tax assets/liabilities are recognized for all deductible/taxable temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements except when the deferred income tax assets/liabilities arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 

Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. 

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at: 

(i) the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date; and 

(ii) the tax consequence that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the balance sheet date, to recover or settle the carrying amounts of its assets and liabilities. 

Current and deferred income taxes are recognized as income or expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")  issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")  No. 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230): Statement of Cash Flows     ( ASU 2016-15 ), which clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses  (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new standard requires financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020, with early application permitted. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). The new guidance will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Under existing accounting guidance, tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies arising from the vesting of share-based payments are recorded in additional paid-in-capital. The new guidance will require such benefits or deficiencies to be recognized as income tax benefits or expenses in the statement of operations.  Companies are required to apply the new guidance prospectively. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases  (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires the lessee to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, the Company is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Further, the lease requires a finance lease to recognize both an interest expense and an amortization of the associated expense. Operating leases generally recognize the associated expense on a straight line basis. ASU 2016-02 requires the Company to adopt the standard using a modified retrospective approach and adoption beginning on January 1, 2019. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments -  Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This new standard provides guidance on how entities measure certain equity investments and present changes in the fair value. This standard requires that entities measure certain equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows upon adoption. 

The Company has reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

Overview 

Medico International Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 18, 2015.  The Company s registration statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2015. 

The Company was formed and organized for the purposes of acting as the holding company for Smile More Holding Pte. Ltd., which is a private Singapore corporation (referred to herein as  Smile Central ). Smile Central is a dental company employing the latest techniques in oral care and oral surgery in Singapore. 

Smile Central's business objectives are to improve techniques and achieve the following: 

- make the existing treatment more effective; 

- decrease the recovery time of patients; and 

- reduce the cost of innovative/cutting edge dental procedures. 

Smile Central is designed to enhance this market with its small core of eminent dentists, key employees, and strong outsourced partners. Management believes that Smile Central has a business model that is easily scalable to effect rapid growth and expansion. 

Smile Central s business model focuses on recruiting qualified and experienced dentists, supported by well-trained clinic support staff. Our dentists have post-graduate training in the fields of endodontics, orthodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, paedodontics, oral surgery and implant dentistry. Hence, we are able to carry out procedures ranging from the routine cleaning and filling to the most complex ones involving aesthetics and surgery. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Month Period Ended September 30, 2016, compared to Three Month Period Ended September 30, 2015 

Revenues  

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we had revenue of $1,814,768, compared to $1,462,510 for the same period for the prior year.  Our revenue growth is attributable to the addition of operating clinics during the past twelve months. 

Cost of Services  

Our cost of services consist of salaries,  lab fees, dental equipment supplies and costs, general overhead costs, including computers and payment processing fees and any other direct costs attributable to the provisions of the dental services offered.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our cost of services were $1,598,219 compared to $1,078,175 for the same period for the prior year.  The increase in the cost of services is due to the addition of new clinics and the additional overhead and salary costs as a result of the opening of the new clinics.  A substantive increase to salary costs, effectively doubling our prior costs, is responsible for the significant decrease in gross margin period over period.  

Rental Expense  

Rental expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were $203,131 compared to $190,253 for the same period in the prior year.  The increase in rental expense is directly attributable to the addition of operating clinics.  

4 

Professional Fees  

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our professional fees were $106,147 compared to $66,411 for the same period in the prior year.  Our professional fees consist of fees for legal services, accounting services, audit services, secretarial services and mentoring fees and the increase is primarily due to an increase in legal fees during the most recently completed three-month period. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

Our general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were $59,447 compared to $41,698 for the same period in the prior year.  The primary drivers of the increase were increases to utilities, advertising, printing and stationary and insurance over the comparative three months as we opened additional operating clinics. 

Depreciation  

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our depreciation expense was $58,662 compared to $44,320 for the same period in the prior year.    The increase was due to the acquisition of additional equipment over the comparative periods as we expanded our clinic base, and the applicable depreciation charges incurred. 

Staff Costs  

Staff costs for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were $32,689 compared to $22,985 for the same period in the prior year .   Staff costs remained relatively constant over the comparative periods. Staff costs relate only to administrative staff including secretarial positions and back office administration .  

Nine Month Period Ended September 30, 2016, compared to Nine Month Period Ended September 30, 2015 

Revenues  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had revenue of $4,949,986, compared to $3,463,009 for the same period for the prior year.  Our revenue growth is attributable to the addition of operating clinics during the past twelve months. 

Cost of Services  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our cost of services were $4,193,785 compared to $2,644,412 for the same period for the prior year. The increase in the cost of services is due to the addition of new clinics and the additional overhead and salary costs as a result of the opening of the new clinics. A substantive increase to salary costs, effectively doubling our prior costs, is responsible for the significant decrease in gross margin period over period.  

Rental Expense  

Rental expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $578,886 compared to $368,060 for the same period in the prior year. The increase in rental expense is directly attributable to the addition of operating clinics during the most recently completed period.  

Professional Fees  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our professional fees were $252,460 compared to $196,991 for the same period in the prior year.  Our professional fees consist of fees for legal services, accounting services, audit services, secretarial services and mentoring fees and the increase is primarily due to an increase in legal fees during the most recently completed nine-month period. 

General and Administrative Expenses  

Our general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 were $207,997 compared to $101,670 for the same period in the prior year.  The primary drivers of the increase were increases to utilities, advertising, printing and stationary and insurance over the comparative nine months as we opened additional operating clinics. 

Depreciation  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our depreciation expense was $151,054 compared to $96,051 for the same period in the prior year.

Staff costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $82,225 compared to $61,164 for the same period in the prior year.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure    controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure    controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
