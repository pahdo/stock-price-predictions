NOTE 1      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ORGANIZATION   

(A) Basis of Presentation    

The accompanying condensed consolidated
unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information. Accordingly,
they do not include all the information necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position and results of operations. 

These unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on April 28, 2016. 

It is management s opinion
that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made, which are necessary for a fair financial
statements presentation.  The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the year. 

Hometown International, Inc. (the
 Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 19, 2014. The Company is the originator of a
new  Delicatessen  concept ( Your Hometown Deli ). The Company intends that its delicatessens will feature
 home-style  sandwiches and other entrees in a casual friendly atmosphere. Hometown Delis are designed to be comfortable
community gathering places for guests of all ages. 

On January 18, 2014, Your Hometown
Deli, LLC. was formed under the laws of the State of New Jersey. On May 29, 2014, Your Hometown Deli, LLC, entered into a Membership
Interest Purchase Agreement with Hometown International, Inc. For accounting purposes, this transaction is being accounted for
as a merger of entities under common control and has been treated as a recapitalization of Hometown International, Inc. with Your
Hometown Deli, LLC, as the accounting acquirer ). The historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer became the financial
statements of the registrant. The Company did not recognize goodwill or any intangible assets in connection with the transaction.
The 5,000,000 shares issued to the shareholder of Your Hometown Deli, LLC., in conjunction with the share exchange transaction
has been presented as outstanding for all periods. 

The Company s accounting year
end is December 31, which was the year end of Your Hometown Deli, LLC. 

(B)
Principles of Consolidation    

The accompanying September 30,
2016 and 2015, condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements include the accounts of Hometown International, Inc. and
its wholly owned subsidiary, Your Hometown Deli, LLC. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated upon consolidation.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

   AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   

   (UNAUDITED)   

(C)
Use of Estimates    

In preparing financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Significant estimates include valuation of in kind contribution
of service and valuation of deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

(D) Cash and Cash Equivalents    

The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
had no cash equivalents. 

(E) Loss Per Share    

Basic and diluted net loss per common
share is computed based upon the weighted average common shares outstanding as defined by FASB ASC No. 260,  Earnings Per
Share.  Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock,
common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. The Company has 484,680 and 198,004
shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants that were not included in the computation of dilutive loss per share because their
inclusion is anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

(F) Income Taxes    

The Company accounts for income
taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 ( ASC 740-10-25 ). Under ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. 

The company s federal income
tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service
through 2018. 

(G) Property and Equipment    

Property and equipment is recorded
at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or the underlying
lease term for leasehold improvements, whichever is shorter onset the property and equipment is put into service.

STATEMENTS  

   AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   

   (UNAUDITED)   

(H) Revenue Recognition    

The Company will recognize revenue
on arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC No. 605,  Revenue Recognition .  In all cases, revenue is recognized
only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability
of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company generates revenue operating a delicatessen deli. Revenue from
the operations of Company-owned delicatessen delis are recognized when sales occur. 

(I) Fair Value of Financial
Instruments    

The Company measures its financial
assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts payable, and
the short-term portion of long-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. 

We adopted accounting guidance for
financial and non-financial assets and liabilities (ASC 820). The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations,
financial position or liquidity. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain
disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements
that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. This
guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value
of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The
guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted
prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.    

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices
that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets
and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.    

Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which
little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that
a market participant would use.

(J) Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

In January
2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, which amends
the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily
affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure
requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when
recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective
for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments
by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance
is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under
the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of adopting this guidance. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets
and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity
that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The core
principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee should recognize
in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing
its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For public companies, the amendments in this Update are effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating
the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus
Net) that clarifies how to apply revenue recognition guidance related to whether an entity is a principal or an agent. ASU 2016-08
clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has control of the goods or services before they are transferred to
the customer and provides additional guidance about how to apply the control principle when services are provided and when goods
or services are combined with other goods or services. The effective date for ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective date of
ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods
within those years. The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-08 on its consolidated financial statements. 

HOMETOWN INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY  

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

   AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   

   (UNAUDITED)   

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation, or ASU No. 2016-09. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, the amendments in this
Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early
adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments
should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption
must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized,
minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition
method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted.
Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares
to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess
tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied
prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement
of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the
impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which provides further
guidance on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of licensing implementation
guidance. The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years.   In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow-Scope Improvements and
Practical Expedients,  which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, non-cash consideration, and the presentation
of sales and other similar taxes. ASU 2016-12 clarifies that, for a contract to be considered completed at transition, all (or
substantially all) of the revenue must have been recognized under legacy GAAP. In addition, ASU 2016-12 clarifies how an entity
should evaluate the collectability threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if
an arrangement does not meet the standard s contract criteria. The standard allows for both retrospective and modified retrospective
methods of adoption.  The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements,  which requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing
a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable
information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein,
beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal year 2021 for the Company). The Company has not yet determined the potential effects
of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which aims to eliminate diversity in practice
in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement
of Cash Flows, and other Topics. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning
after December 15, 2017 (fiscal year 2019 for the Company). The Company has not yet determined the potential effects of the adoption
of ASU 2016-15 on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 

All other newly issued accounting
pronouncements, but not yet effective, have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable. 

(K) Business Segments    

The Company operates in one segment
and therefore segment information is not presented.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

   AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   

   (UNAUDITED)   

As reflected in the
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company used cash in operations of $72,985, has an accumulated
deficit of $416,862 and has a net loss of $162,517 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This raises substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is
dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern. 

Management believes that actions
presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for the Company to
continue as a going concern. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

The information
set forth in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A )
contains certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including,
among others (i) expected changes in our revenue and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii) our strategy
for financing our business. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current
condition. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of terms such as  believes ,  anticipates ,
 intends  or  expects . These forward-looking statements relate to our plans, liquidity, ability to complete
financing and purchase capital expenditures, growth of our business including entering into future agreements with companies, and
plans to successfully develop and obtain approval to market our product. We have based these forward-looking statements largely
on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition,
results of operations, business strategy and financial needs.  

Although
we believe that our expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the
bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections,
the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by us
or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved.  

We assume
no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting
forward-looking statements.  

Our revenues and results of operations
could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, including, but
not limited to, the following: the risk of significant natural disaster, the inability of the company to insure against certain
risks, inflationary and deflationary conditions and cycles, currency exchange rates, and changing government regulations domestically
and internationally affecting our products and businesses.  

You should
read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes attached hereto, and the other
financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.  

US Dollars
are denoted herein by  USD ,  $  and  dollars .  

Overview  

Incorporated
on May 19, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada, Hometown International, Inc. is the originator of a new Delicatessen concept.
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Your Hometown Deli Limited Liability Company ( Your Hometown Deli ), we operate
delicatessen stores that feature  home-style  sandwiches and other entrees in a casual and friendly atmosphere. The
stores are designed to offer local patrons of all ages with a comfortable community gathering places. Targeted towards smaller
towns and communities, the Company s first unit is planned to be built in Paulsboro, New Jersey.  

On January 18, 2014, Your Hometown Deli,
LLC. was formed under the laws of State of New Jersey. On May 29, 2014, Your Hometown Deli, LLC, entered into a Membership Interest
Purchase Agreement with our Company and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company. We introduced the delicatessen concept
under the Your Hometown Deli brand name. Based on the Paulsboro unit s performance, we may consider expanding the concept
to other communities throughout the United States. 

The Company is the originator of a new
 Delicatessen  concept called  Your Hometown Deli.  Your Hometown Delis plan to feature  home-style 
sandwiches, food items, and groceries in a casual and friendly atmosphere. Your Hometown Delis are designed to be comfortable community
gathering places for customers of all ages. The Company seeks to create an establishment that will appeal to local residents and
commuting workers, conveniently offering high-quality products at fair prices. Targeted towards smaller towns and communities,
the Company's first location was opened in Paulsboro, New Jersey on October 14, 2015. 

The Your Hometown Deli Concept  

Your Hometown Deli is a delicatessen
concept that will focus on providing high-quality food products not available in local supermarkets or take-out restaurants. The
delicatessen concept has a worldwide history with the term first appearing in the English language in 1889. The word  delicatessen 
originates in the German language and means  delicacies  or  fine foods.  Delicatessens vary throughout the
world, but in the United States a delicatessen (or  deli ) is a small retail store that is a blend of a grocery and
a fast-food restaurant. 

The Company s Your Hometown Deli
concept is patterned after traditional delicatessens, offering a wider and fresher menu than found at fast-food restaurants. Sandwiches
and green salads will be made fresh to order. Like many delis, Your Hometown Deli serves some hot foods kept on a steam table,
similar to a cafeteria. In addition to ready-to-eat food, the Your Hometown Deli sells cold cuts by weight. A wide variety of beverages
are also sold together with potato chips and similar products. 

In addition to our food offering, newspapers,
limited household items and small snack items, such as candy, cookies and chewing gums are planned to be available for purchase.
Your Hometown Deli also provides take-out service and limited seating in the store. 

We have begun generating revenue from
the sales of our food and beverage since our soft opening in mid-October. Besides the equipment, fixtures, and inventories we purchased
for our deli store, we have limited assets. We had minimal working capital as of the date of this quarterly report and used cash
in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt from our auditor about our ability
to continue as a going concern. 

During the quarter ending September
30, 2016, we continued to refine our menu and operating hours. We 

 have limited advertising using social
media and direct mailing to residents in towns around our store, however, we recently placed an advertisement in a local high school
sports calendar and have attended various local events with food samples and menus.  Events like the Lighthouse Challenge
held at Tinicum Rear Range Lighthouse and various political fundraisers throughout Gloucester County. We expect our losses to continue
during 2016 as we continue to revise our menu and marketing plan to the local taste. 

Results of Operations - Three and Nine Months Ended 
September 30, 2016 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

We generated revenue of $16,176 and
$0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in revenue is mainly attributed to the increase
of our sales. The total cost and expenses was $61,764 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $40,246 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. We incurred loss from operations of $47,953 and $40,396 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase of $7,557 is mainly attributed to the increase in our cost related to interest expense,
professional fees, and general and administrative expenses. 

We generated revenue of $58,717 and
$0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in revenue is mainly attributed to the increase
of our sales. The total cost and expenses was $215,465 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $132,825 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. We incurred loss from operations of $162,517 and $133,050 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase of $29,467 is mainly attributed to the increase in our cost related to interest expense,
professional fees, and general and administrative expenses. 

Due to the described factors above,
we had a net loss of $162,517 and $133,050 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

As of September 30, 2016, we had total assets of
$37,524, mainly in leasehold improvements and total current assets of $8,814, mainly in cash and inventory. Our liabilities
as of September 30, 2016 were $214,135, which comprised of $90,654 in accounts payable and accrued expenses, $10,481 due to
certain officers, $2,000 in note payable due to a related party and $111,000 in note payable. As of September 30, 2016, we
had a working capital deficit of $205,321. 

The following is a summary of our cash
flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we had used cash of $72,983 for operating activities and financing activities provided $78,210. We had a net increase
of $5,227 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

We are dependent on the sales of product
and services and receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund our ongoing operations. If continued funding and capital
resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement its plan of operations. 

Going Concern  

As reflected in the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements, the Company used cash in operations of $72,983, has a net loss of $162,517 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, and an accumulated deficit of $416,862 as of September 30, 2016. This raises substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s
ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management believes that actions presently
being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for the Company to continue
as a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Revenue Recognition   

The Company will recognize revenue on
arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC No. 605,  Revenue Recognition . In all cases, revenue is recognized only when
the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability
of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company generates revenue operating a delicatessen deli. Revenue from the
operations of Company-owned delicatessen delis are recognized when sales occur. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material
to an investment in our securities. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk.  

Not applicable because we are a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of
the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer
( CFO ) (the Company s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered
by this report. The framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled
 Internal Control   Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (2013 framework). Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of September 30, 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure for the reason described below. 

Because of our limited operations, we
have limited number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties. In addition, we lack a formal audit committee with a
financial expert. As we grow and expand our operations we will engage additional employees and experts as needed. However, there
can be no assurance that our operations will expand. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

From time to time, we may become involved
in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently
not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition or operating results.
