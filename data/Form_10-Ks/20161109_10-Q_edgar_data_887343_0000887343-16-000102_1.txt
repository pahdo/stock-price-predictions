    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 
     Basis of Presentation 
  The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Columbia Banking System, Inc. ( we ,  our ,  Columbia  or the  Company ) and its subsidiaries, including its wholly owned banking subsidiary Columbia State Bank ( Columbia Bank  or the  Bank ) and Columbia Trust Company ( Columbia Trust ). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented have been included. The results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results to be anticipated for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Because of reclassifications, changes occurred in the manner in which certain comparative period noninterest income items were presented in the unaudited consolidated statements of income. Specifically, fee revenue previously presented as  Service charges and other fees  and certain fee revenue previously presented as  Other  were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The Company made these presentation changes to provide additional information about its sources of noninterest income. There was no change to total noninterest income as previously reported as a result of these reclassifications.  
  Significant Accounting Policies 
  The significant accounting policies used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have not been any changes in our significant accounting policies compared to those contained in our   2015   Form 10-K disclosure for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
           2. 
    Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued 
     In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The amendments in this ASU provide specific guidance on several statement of cash flow classification issues to reduce diversity in practice. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . The amendments included in this ASU require an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses for assets held at an amortized cost basis. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP, however, this ASU will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and are required to be adopted through a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the ASU is effective. The Company is assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The amendments included in this ASU simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements but does not expect the impact to be material. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . The amendments included in this ASU create a new accounting model for both lessees and lessors. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. The amendments in ASU 2016-02 must be adopted using the modified retrospective approach and will be effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2018.

     Table of Contents   

Early adoption is permitted. The Company is assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . The amendments in ASU 2016-01 require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. In addition, the amendments in this update eliminate the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet for public business entities. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements but does not expect the impact to be material. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The guidance in this update will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. For public companies, this update was to be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. However, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year and permits companies to voluntarily adopt the new standard as of the original effective date. In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, respectively, to provide implementation guidance and practical expedients related to ASU 2014-09. The Company is assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements but does not expect the impact to be material. 
   
  3.    Securities 
  The following table summarizes the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and the resulting fair value of securities available for sale:

     Table of Contents   

Proceeds from sales of securities available for sale were   $37.4 million   and   $10.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and were   $120.8 million   and   $82.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The following table provides the gross realized gains and losses on the sales of securities for the periods indicated:   

  The scheduled contractual maturities of investment securities available for sale at   September 30, 2016   are presented as follows:   

  The following table summarizes the carrying value of securities pledged as collateral to secure public deposits, borrowings and other purposes as permitted or required by law:

     Table of Contents   

The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company s investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :    

  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   83   U.S. government agency and government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations securities in an unrealized loss position, of which   46   were in a continuous loss position for 12 months or more. The decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates relative to where these investments fall within the yield curve and their individual characteristics. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities nor does the Company consider it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of amortized cost basis, which may be upon maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .  
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   35   state and municipal government securities in an unrealized loss position, of which   five   were in a continuous loss position for 12 months or more. The unrealized losses on state and municipal securities were caused by interest rate changes or widening of market spreads subsequent to the purchase of the individual securities. Management monitors published credit ratings of these securities for adverse changes. As of   September 30, 2016  , none of the rated obligations of state and local government entities held by the Company had a below investment grade credit rating. Because the credit quality of these securities are investment grade and the Company does not intend to sell these securities nor does the Company consider it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of amortized cost basis, which may be upon maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .  
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   five   U.S. government agency and government-sponsored enterprise securities in an unrealized loss position, of which   none   was in a continuous loss position for 12 months or more. The decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates relative to where these investments fall within the yield curve and their individual characteristics. Because the Company does not currently intend to sell these securities nor does the Company consider it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of amortized cost basis, which may be upon maturity, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .  
  At   September 30, 2016  , there was   one   other security in an unrealized loss position, which was in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. The decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and the additional risk premium investors are demanding for investment securities with these characteristics. The Company does not consider this investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016   as it has the intent and ability to hold the investment for sufficient time to allow for recovery in the market value.

4.    Loans 
  The Company s loan portfolio includes originated and purchased loans. Originated loans and purchased loans for which there was no evidence of credit deterioration at their acquisition date and it was probable that we would be able to collect all contractually required payments are referred to collectively as loans, excluding purchased credit impaired loans. Purchased loans for which there was, at acquisition date, evidence of credit deterioration since their origination and it was probable that we would be unable to collect all contractually required payments are referred to as purchased credit impaired loans, or  PCI loans.  
  The following is an analysis of the loan portfolio by segment (net of unearned income):   

  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had no material foreign activities. Substantially all of the Company s loans and unfunded commitments are geographically concentrated in its service areas within the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. 
  The Company has made loans to executive officers and directors of the Company and related interests. These loans are made on the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability. The aggregate dollar amount of these loans was   $10.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $10.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  . During the first   nine   months of   2016  , there were   $759 thousand   in advances and   $652 thousand   in repayments.  
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $2.30 billion   and   $2.22 billion   of commercial and residential real estate loans were pledged as collateral on Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ( FHLB ) borrowings and additional borrowing capacity. The Company has also pledged   $50.0 million   and   $50.1 million   of commercial loans to the Federal Reserve Bank for additional borrowing capacity at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

     Table of Contents   

The following table provides additional information on impaired loans for the   three   and   nine   month periods indicated:   

15 

     Table of Contents   

The following is an analysis of loans classified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDR ) during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The Company s loans classified as TDR are loans that have been modified or the borrower has been granted special concessions due to financial difficulties that, if not for the challenges of the borrower, the Company would not otherwise consider. The TDR modifications or concessions are made to increase the likelihood that these borrowers with financial difficulties will be able to satisfy their debt obligations as amended. The concessions granted in the restructurings summarized in the table above largely consisted of maturity extensions, interest rate modifications or a combination of both. In limited circumstances, a reduction in the principal balance of the loan could also be made as a concession. Credit losses for loans classified as TDR are measured on the same basis as impaired loans. For impaired loans, an allowance is established when the collateral value less selling costs (or discounted cash flows or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the recorded investment of that loan.  
  The Company had commitments to lend   $51 thousand   of additional funds on loans classified as TDR as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company had   no   such commitments at   December 31, 2015  . The Company did not have any loans modified as TDR that defaulted within twelve months of being modified as TDR during the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  Purchased Credit Impaired Loans 
  Purchased credit impaired ( PCI ) loans are accounted for under ASC 310-30 and initially measured at fair value based on expected future cash flows over the life of the loans. Loans that have common risk characteristics are aggregated into pools. The Company remeasures contractual and expected cash flows, at the pool-level, on a quarterly basis. 
  Contractual cash flows are calculated based upon the loan pool terms after applying a prepayment factor. Calculation of the applied prepayment factor for contractual cash flows is the same as described below for expected cash flows. 
  Inputs to the determination of expected cash flows include cumulative default and prepayment data as well as loss severity and recovery lag information. Cumulative default and prepayment data are calculated via a transition matrix, which utilizes  
  
    16 

     Table of Contents   

probability values of a loan pool transitioning into a particular delinquency state (e.g. 0-30 days past due, 31 to 60 days, etc.) given its delinquency state at the remeasurement date. Loss severity factors are based upon either actual charge-off data within the loan pools or industry averages, and recovery lags are based upon the collateral within the loan pools. 
  The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the initial fair value of purchased credit impaired loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is accreted into interest income over the estimated life of the acquired loans using the effective yield method. Other adjustments to the accretable yield include changes in the estimated remaining life of the acquired loans, changes in expected cash flows and changes of indices for acquired loans with variable interest rates. 
  The following is an analysis of our PCI loans, net of related allowance for losses and remaining valuation discounts as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :   

  The following table shows the changes in accretable yield for PCI loans for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

5.     Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Commitments and Letters of Credit 
  We record an allowance for loan and lease losses (the  allowance ) to recognize management s estimate of credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. Management s allowance estimate is measured quarterly and the primary components include allowances related to: 
           1. 
    Loans collectively evaluated for impairment under the Contingencies topic of the FASB ASC.  
              2. 
    Loans individually determined to be impaired in accordance with the Receivables topic of the FASB ASC. 
              3. 
    Purchased credit impaired loans accounted for under the Receivables topic of the FASB ASC. 
     The allowance for loans collectively evaluated for impairment is measured using quantitative information adjusted by qualitative factors. Quantitative information includes credit loss experience over a historical base period and a loss emergence period estimated by loan product category such as commercial business, commercial real estate, etc. Historical loss experience by loan class incorporates the loan s risk rating migration from origination to the point of loss. Loan risk ratings are assigned  
  
    17 

     Table of Contents   

based upon an assessment of the borrower s ability to service the debt. In the event a borrower experiences financial deterioration such that the primary source of loan repayment is at risk, secondary sources of loan repayment, such as guarantors, are considered. 
  As conditions likely differ between the historical base period and the balance sheet date, management qualitatively adjusts the historical loss rate to assist in ensuring our allowance estimate reflects current conditions. Such qualitative adjustments include general economic and business conditions affecting our marketplace, seasoning of the loan portfolio, duration of the business cycle, trends with respect to delinquencies and problem loans, etc. In addition, the allowance may include an unallocated amount to recognize factors inherent in our loan portfolio but not otherwise contemplated. Any unallocated amount generally comprises less than   5%   of the allowance. 
  For loans individually determined to be impaired, the Company measures impairment on a loan-by-loan basis using either the discounted expected future cash flows, observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent or if foreclosure is probable. A specific reserve for such loans is recognized to the extent the measured value is less than the loan s recorded investment.  
  Purchased credit impaired loans that have common risk characteristics are aggregated into loan pools. When required, we record impairment, at the pool-level, to adjust the pool s carrying value to its net present value of expected future cash flows. Quarterly, we re-measure expected loan pool cash flows. If, due to credit deterioration, the present value of expected cash flows is less than carrying value, we reduce the loan pool s carrying value by adjusting the allowance with an impairment charge to earnings which is recorded as provision for loan losses. If credit quality improves and the present value of expected cash flows exceeds carrying value, we increase the loan pool s carrying value by recapturing previously recorded allowance, if any. See Note 4, Loans, for further discussion of the accounting for PCI loans. Credit losses attributable to draws on purchased credit impaired loans, advanced subsequent to the loan purchase date, are accounted for under the Contingencies topic of the FASB ASC as described above. 
  We have used the same methodology for allowance calculations during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company carefully monitors the loan portfolio and continues to emphasize the importance of credit quality. We recognize loan charge-offs when management determines that all or a portion of a loan balance is uncollectable and the uncollectable amount can be reasonably estimated.

Risk Elements 
  The extension of credit in the form of loans or other credit products to individuals and businesses is one of our principal business activities. Our policies and applicable laws and regulations require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management. We manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints, credit review, approval policies and extensive, ongoing internal monitoring. We also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan, type of industry and type of borrower and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower. 
  Risk ratings are reviewed and updated whenever appropriate, with more periodic reviews as the risk and dollar value of loss on the loan increases. In the event full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured, the loan is appropriately downgraded and, if warranted, placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments. Additionally, we assess whether an impairment of a loan warrants specific reserves or a write-down of the loan. 
  Pass rated loans are generally considered to have sufficient sources of repayment in order to repay the loan in full in accordance with all terms and conditions. Special Mention rated loans have potential weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Company s credit position at some future date. Loans with a risk rating of Substandard or worse are reported as classified loans in our allowance analysis. We review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and, as a result, the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly. Loans risk rated as Substandard reflect loans where a loss is possible if loan weaknesses are not corrected. Doubtful rated loans have a high probability of loss, however, the amount of loss has not yet been determined. Loss rated loans are considered uncollectable and when identified, are charged off.

  The following tables set forth activity in OREO for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

At   September 30, 2016  , the carrying amount of foreclosed residential real estate properties held as a result of obtaining physical possession was   $604 thousand   and the recorded investment of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process was   $876 thousand  . 
   
  7.    FDIC Loss-sharing Asset and Covered Assets 
  We are a party to eight loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC relating to four FDIC-assisted acquisitions. Such agreements cover a substantial portion of losses incurred on acquired covered loans and OREO. The loss-sharing agreements relate to the acquisitions of (1) Columbia River Bank in January 2010, (2) American Marine Bank in January 2010, (3) Summit Bank in May 2011, and (4) First Heritage Bank in May 2011. Under the terms of the loss-sharing agreements, the FDIC will absorb   80%   of losses and share in   80%   of loss recoveries up to specified amounts. With respect to loss-sharing agreements for two acquisitions completed in 2010, after those specified amounts, the FDIC will absorb   95%   of losses and share in   95%   of loss recoveries. The loss-sharing provisions of the agreements for non-single family and single family mortgage loans are in effect for   five   and   ten   years, respectively, and the loss recovery provisions are in effect for   eight   and   ten   years, respectively. The loss-sharing provisions for the Columbia River Bank and American Marine Bank non-single family covered assets were effective through the end of the first quarter of 2015. In addition, the loss-sharing provisions for the Summit Bank and First Heritage Bank non-single family covered assets expired at the end of the second quarter of 2016. Accordingly, further activity will be limited to recoveries through the first quarter of 2018 and second quarter of 2019, respectively, for assets covered by these loss-sharing agreements. 
  Ten years and forty-five days after the applicable acquisition dates, the Bank must pay to the FDIC a clawback in the event the losses from the acquisitions fail to reach stated levels. The amount of the clawback is determined by a formula specified in each individual loss-sharing agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the net present value of the Bank s estimated clawback liability was   $5.5 million  , which was included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the FDIC loss-sharing asset was comprised of a   $3.2 million   FDIC indemnification asset and a   $438 thousand   FDIC receivable. The indemnification asset represents the net present value of cash flows the Company expects to collect from the FDIC under the loss-sharing agreements and the FDIC receivable represents amounts from the FDIC for which the Company has requested reimbursement but has not yet received reimbursement. 
  For PCI loans, the Company remeasures contractual and expected cash flows on a quarterly basis. When the quarterly remeasurement process results in a decrease in expected cash flows due to an increase in expected credit losses, impairment is recorded. As a result of this impairment, for loans covered by loss-sharing agreements with respect to which the loss-sharing provisions are still effective, the indemnification asset is increased to reflect anticipated future cash to be received from the FDIC. Consistent with the loss-sharing agreements between the Company and the FDIC, the amount of the increase to the indemnification asset is measured as   80%   of the resulting impairment. 
  Alternatively, when the quarterly remeasurement results in an increase in expected future cash flows due to a decrease in expected credit losses, the nonaccretable difference decreases and the effective yield of the related loan portfolio is increased. As a result of the improved expected cash flows, for loans covered by loss-sharing agreements with respect to which the loss-sharing provisions are still effective, the indemnification asset would be reduced first by the amount of any impairment previously recorded and, second, by increased amortization over the remaining life of the related loss-sharing agreement.

8.    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  In accordance with the Intangibles   Goodwill and Other topic of the FASB ASC, goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level. Management analyzes its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on July 31 and between annual tests in certain circumstances such as material adverse changes in legal, business, regulatory and economic factors. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The Company performed an impairment assessment as of July 31, 2016 and concluded that there was no impairment. 
  The core deposit intangible ( CDI ) is evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment. The CDI is amortized on an accelerated basis over an estimated life of   10 years  .

9.    Derivatives and Balance Sheet Offsetting 
  The Company periodically enters into certain commercial loan interest rate swap agreements in order to provide commercial loan customers the ability to convert from variable to fixed interest rates. Under these agreements, the Company enters into a variable-rate loan agreement with a customer in addition to a swap agreement. This swap agreement effectively converts the customer s variable rate loan into a fixed rate. The Company then enters into a corresponding swap agreement with a third-party in order to offset its exposure on the variable and fixed components of the customer agreement. As the interest rate swap agreements with the customers and third parties are not designated as hedges under the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the FASB ASC, the instruments are marked to market in earnings. The notional amount of open interest rate swap agreements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $286.5 million   and   $264.4 million  , respectively. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a mark-to-market gain of   $9 thousand   and   $2 thousand  , respectively, were recorded to other noninterest expense. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , mark-to-market losses of   $6 thousand   and   $2 thousand  , respectively, were recorded to other noninterest expense.

The collateral utilized for the Company s repurchase agreements is subject to market fluctuations as well as prepayments of principal. The Company monitors the risk of the fair value of its pledged collateral falling below acceptable amounts based on the type of the underlying repurchase agreement. The pledged collateral related to the Company s term wholesale repurchase agreement, which matures in 2018, is monitored on a monthly basis and additional capital is pledged when necessary. The pledged collateral related to the Company s sweep repurchase agreements, which mature on an overnight basis, is monitored on a daily basis as the underlying sweep accounts can have frequent transaction activity and the amount of pledged collateral is adjusted as necessary.  
   
  10.    Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
  Lease Commitments:   The Company s lease commitments consist primarily of leased locations under various non-cancellable operating leases that expire between   2016   and 2043. The majority of the leases contain renewal options and provisions for increases in rental rates based on an agreed upon index or predetermined escalation schedule. 
  Sale-leaseback transaction:    On August 24, 2016, the Company sold one of its Washington facilities and leased back the portion of the facility utilized for branch operations. The resulting gain on sale of   $742 thousand   was deferred in accordance with the Leases topic of the FASB ASC and is being amortized over the life of the respective lease. At   September 30, 2016  , the deferred gain was   $730 thousand   and is a component of "Other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet. 
  Exit or disposal activities:   As part of ongoing evaluations of facilities owned or leased by the Company for ongoing economic benefit, a decision was made to cease using one of our Idaho branch locations during the current quarter. As a result, in addition to recording a cease-use liability of   $849 thousand   in the current quarter, the Company also made a change in estimate for the useful lives of the fixed assets associated with this facility. The total expense related to the exit activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $857 thousand   and   $883 thousand  , respectively, and was recorded in the noninterest expense line item "Occupancy" in the consolidated statements of income. 
  Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk:   In the normal course of business, the Company makes loan commitments (typically unfunded loans and unused lines of credit) and issues standby letters of credit to accommodate the financial needs of its customers. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s loan commitments amounted to   $2.10 billion   and   $1.93 billion  , respectively. 
  Standby letters of credit commit the Company to make payments on behalf of customers under specified conditions. Historically, no significant losses have been incurred by the Company under standby letters of credit. Both arrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and are subject to the Company s normal credit policies, including collateral requirements, where appropriate. Standby letters of credit were   $48.4 million   and   $38.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. In addition, commitments under commercial letters of credit used to facilitate customers  trade transactions and other off-balance sheet liabilities amounted to   $6.6 million   and   $5.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Legal Proceedings:   The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time defendants in and are threatened with various legal proceedings arising from their regular business activities. Management, after consulting with legal counsel, is of the opinion that the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from these pending or threatened actions and proceedings will not have a material effect on the financial statements of the Company. 
   
  11.    Shareholders  Equity 
  Preferred Stock:   In conjunction with the 2013 acquisition of West Coast Bancorp, the Company issued   8,782   shares of mandatorily convertible cumulative participating preferred stock, Series B ( Series B Preferred Stock ). The Series B Preferred Stock is not subject to the operation of a sinking fund. The Series B Preferred Stock is not redeemable by the Company and is perpetual with no maturity. The holders of Series B Preferred Stock have no general voting rights. If the Company declares and pays a dividend to its common shareholders, it must declare and pay to its holders of Series B Preferred Stock, on the same date, a dividend in an amount per share of the Series B Preferred Stock that is intended to provide such holders dividends in the amount they would have received if shares of Series B Preferred Stock had been converted into common stock as of that date. The outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible into   102,363   shares of Company common stock. 
  Dividends:   On   January 28, 2016  , the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.18   per common share and common share equivalent for holders of preferred stock, and a special cash dividend of   $0.20   per common share and common share equivalent for holders of preferred stock, both payable on   February 24, 2016   to shareholders of record at the close of business on   February 10, 2016  .

13.    Fair Value Accounting and Measurement 
  The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the FASB ASC defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value. We hold fixed and variable rate interest-bearing securities, investments in marketable equity securities and certain other financial instruments, which are carried at fair value. Fair value is determined based upon quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as matrix or model pricing, when market quotes are not readily accessible or available. 
  The valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our own market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: 
  Level 1   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. 
  Level 2   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 
  Level 3   Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
  Fair values are determined as follows: 
  Securities at fair value are priced using a combination of market activity, industry recognized information sources, yield curves, discounted cash flow models and other factors. These fair value calculations are considered a Level 2 input method under the provisions of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the FASB ASC for all securities other than U.S. Treasury Notes, which are considered a Level 1 input method. 
  Interest rate contract positions are valued in models, which use as their basis, readily observable market parameters and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

The following table sets forth the Company s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   by level within the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement:   

There were   no   transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy during the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company recognizes transfers between levels of the valuation hierarchy based on the valuation level at the end of the reporting period.

Nonrecurring Measurements 
  Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis after initial recognition such as loans measured for impairment and OREO. The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of each such class of financial instrument: 
  Impaired loans   A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due (both interest and principal) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, a loan s observable market price, or the fair market value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell if the loan is a collateral-dependent loan. Generally, the Company utilizes the fair market value of the collateral to measure impairment. The impairment evaluations are performed in conjunction with the allowance process on a quarterly basis by officers in the Special Credits group, which reports to the Chief Credit Officer. The Real Estate Appraisal Services Department ( REASD ), which also reports to the Chief Credit Officer, is responsible for obtaining appraisals from third-parties or performing internal evaluations. If an appraisal is obtained from a third-party, the REASD reviews the appraisal to evaluate the adequacy of the appraisal report, including its scope, methods, accuracy, and reasonableness. 
  Other real estate owned   OREO is real property that the Bank has taken ownership of in partial or full satisfaction of a loan or loans. OREO is generally measured based on the property s fair market value as indicated by an appraisal or a letter of intent to purchase. OREO is initially recorded at the fair value less estimated costs to sell. This amount becomes the property s new basis. Any fair value adjustments based on the property s fair value less estimated costs to sell at the date of acquisition are charged to the allowance, or in the event of a write-up without previous losses charged to the allowance, a credit to earnings is recorded. Management periodically reviews OREO in an effort to ensure the property is recorded at its fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Any fair value adjustments subsequent to acquisition are charged or credited to earnings. The initial and subsequent evaluations are performed by officers in the Special Credits group, which reports to the Chief Credit Officer. The REASD obtains appraisals from third-parties for OREO and performs internal evaluations. If an appraisal is obtained from a third-party, the REASD reviews the appraisal to evaluate the adequacy of the appraisal report, including its scope, methods, accuracy, and reasonableness.  
  The following tables set forth information related to the Company s assets that were measured using fair value estimates on a nonrecurring basis during the current and prior year quarterly periods: 

The losses on impaired loans disclosed above represent the amount of the specific reserve and/or charge-offs during the period applicable to loans held at period end. The amount of the specific reserve is included in the allowance for loan and lease losses. The losses on OREO disclosed above represent the write-downs taken at foreclosure that were charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses, as well as subsequent changes in any valuation allowances from updated appraisals that were recorded to earnings.

Fair value of financial instruments 
  Because broadly traded markets do not exist for most of the Company s financial instruments, the fair value calculations attempt to incorporate the effect of current market conditions at a specific time. These determinations are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and do not include tax ramifications; therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision, substantiated by comparison to independent markets and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the instruments. There may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results. For all of these reasons, the aggregation of the fair value calculations presented herein do not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of the Company. 
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value: 
  Cash and due from banks and interest-earning deposits with banks   The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term or reprice frequently and that have little or no risk are considered to have a fair value that approximates carrying value (Level 1). 
  Securities available for sale   Securities at fair value, other than U.S. Treasury Notes, are priced using a combination of market activity, industry recognized information sources, yield curves, discounted cash flow models and other factors (Level 2). U.S. Treasury Notes are priced using quotes in active markets (Level 1).  
  Federal Home Loan Bank stock   The fair value is based upon the par value of the stock which equates to its carrying value (Level 2). 
  Loans held for sale   The carrying amount of loans held for sale approximates their fair values due to the short period of time between the origination and sale dates (Level 2). 
  Loans   Loans are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis  .   Nonrecurring fair value adjustments are periodically recorded on impaired loans that are measured for impairment based on the fair value of collateral. For most performing loans, fair value is estimated using expected duration and lending rates that would have been offered on   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  , for loans which mirror the attributes of the loans with similar rate structures and average maturities. The fair values resulting from these calculations are reduced by an amount representing the change in estimated fair value attributable to changes in borrowers  credit quality since the loans were originated. For nonperforming loans, fair value is estimated by applying a valuation discount based upon loan sales data from the FDIC. For PCI loans, fair value is estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using a lending rate that would have been offered on   September 30, 2016   (Level 3). 
  FDIC loss-sharing asset    The fair value of the FDIC loss-sharing asset is estimated based on discounting the expected future cash flows using an estimated market rate (Level 3). 
  Interest rate contracts   Interest rate swap positions are valued in discounted cash flow models, which use readily observable market parameters as their basis (Level 2). 
  Deposits   For deposits with no contractual maturity, the fair value is equal to the carrying value (Level 1). The fair value of fixed maturity deposits is based on discounted cash flows using the difference between the deposit rate and current market rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities (Level 2). 
  FHLB advances   The fair value of FHLB advances is estimated based on discounting the future cash flows using the market rate currently offered (Level 2). 
  Repurchase Agreements   The fair value of term repurchase agreements is estimated based on discounting the future cash flows using the market rate currently offered. The carrying amount of sweep repurchase agreements approximates their fair values due to the short period of time between repricing dates (Level 2). 
  Other Financial Instruments   The majority of our commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit carry current market interest rates if converted to loans, as such, carrying value is assumed to equal fair value.

14.    Earnings per Common Share 
  The Company applies the two-class method of computing basic and diluted EPS. Under the two-class method, EPS is determined for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The Company issues restricted shares under share-based compensation plans and preferred shares which qualify as participating securities.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

__________ 
           (1) 
    Earnings allocated to common shareholders for basic and diluted EPS may differ under the two-class method as a result of adding common stock equivalents for options and warrants to dilutive shares outstanding, which alters the ratio used to allocate earnings to common shareholders and participating securities for the purposes of calculating diluted EPS.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Management has identified the accounting policies related to the allowance for loan and lease losses (the  allowance ), business combinations, purchased credit impaired ( PCI ) loans, FDIC loss-sharing asset and the valuation and recoverability of goodwill as critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These policies and related estimates are discussed in  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  under the headings  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,   Business Combinations,   Purchased Credit Impaired Loans,   FDIC Loss-sharing Asset  and  Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill  in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have not been any material changes in our critical accounting policies as compared to those disclosed in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
   
  Our results of operations are dependent to a large degree on our net interest income. We also generate noninterest income from our broad range of products and services including treasury management, wealth management, debit and credit cards and merchant card processing. Our operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy, data processing and legal and professional fees. Like most financial institutions, our interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, and by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 
   
  Earnings Summary 
  Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 
  The Company reported net income for the   third   quarter of   $27.5 million   or   $0.47   per diluted common share, compared to   $25.8 million   or   $0.45   per diluted common share for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Net interest income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $85.6 million  , an increase of   $3.9 million   from the prior year period. The increase was a result of higher interest income on loans and taxable securities primarily due to higher volume of such interest-earning assets. Noninterest income for the current quarter was   $23.2 million  , an increase of   $667 thousand   from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the change in FDIC loss-sharing asset. 
  The provision for loan and lease losses for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $1.9 million   compared to a provision of   $2.8 million   during the   third   quarter of   2015  . The provision recorded in the   third   quarter of   2016   was due to the recording of a   $2.3 million   provision on loans, excluding PCI loans, and a   $433 thousand   provision recapture related to PCI loans. 
  Total noninterest expense for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was   $67.3 million  , an increase from   $64.1 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increase from the prior year period was primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense.  
  Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 
  Net interest income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $247.9 million  , an increase of   $4.8 million   from the prior year period. The increase was due to higher loan and securities volumes, partially offset by lower incremental accretion income on loans. Noninterest income for the current period was   $65.8 million  , a decrease of   $1.0 million   from the prior year period. The decrease was due to lower financial services revenue.  
  The provision for loan and lease losses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $10.8 million   compared to a provision of   $6.2 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . The   $10.8 million   provision was due to recording a provision of     $10.4 million   for loans, excluding PCI loans, and a provision of   $311 thousand   related to PCI loans. 
  Total noninterest expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $196.1 million  , a   2%   decrease from the prior year period. The decrease from the prior-year period was primarily due to lower acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by higher compensation and employee benefits expense and lower net OREO benefit.

Net Interest Income 
  The following table sets forth the average balances of all major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities by category and, in total, net interest income and net interest margin:  

__________ 
           (1) 
    Nonaccrual loans have been included in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield. Amortized net deferred loan fees and net unearned discounts on acquired loans were included in the interest income calculations. The amortization of net deferred loan fees was $1.4 million and $1.2 million for the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The incremental accretion income on acquired loans was   $4.6 million   and   $6.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
       
           (2) 
    Tax-exempt income is calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on loans was   $1.2 million   and   $989 thousand   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on tax exempt securities was   $1.5 million   and   $1.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

    Nonaccrual loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. Amortized net deferred loan fees and net unearned discounts on acquired loans were included in the interest income calculations. The amortization of net deferred loan fees was $3.6 million and $3.8 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The incremental accretion income on acquired loans was   $13.7 million   and   $21.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
       
           (2) 
    Tax-exempt income is calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on loans was   $3.5 million   and   $2.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The tax equivalent yield adjustment to interest earned on tax exempt securities was   $4.5 million   and   $4.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

The following table shows the impact to interest income of incremental accretion income as well as the net interest margin and operating net interest margin for the periods presented: 

__________ 
  (1) Operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) is a non-GAAP measurement. See Non-GAAP measures section of Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis. 
  (2) For 2016, incremental accretion income on other FDIC acquired loans is no longer considered significant. 
  Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 
  Net interest income for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $85.6 million  , up from   $81.7 million   for the same quarter in   2015  . The increase was due to higher loan and securities volumes, partially offset by lower incremental accretion income on loans. As shown in the table above, incremental accretion income continued to decline which was reflective of the decrease in volume of acquired loans. Average interest-earning assets were up   $833.3 million   from the prior year period due to loan growth and purchases of investment securities. The Company s net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to   4.13%   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , from   4.37%   for the prior year period. This decrease was due to a combination of lower incremental accretion income on acquired loans and lower yielding originated loans. The Company s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to   4.03%   from   4.18%   due to lower yielding originated loans (see footnote 1 in prior table). 
  Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 
  Net interest income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $247.9 million  , an increase of   2%   from   $243.1 million   for the prior year period. The increase in net interest income was due to higher loan and securities volumes, partially offset by lower incremental accretion income on loans. The Company s net interest margin (tax equivalent) decreased to   4.12%   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , from   4.39%   for the prior year period. The decrease in the Company s net interest margin (tax equivalent) was due to a combination of lower accretion income on the acquired loans and lower yielding originated loans. As shown in the table above, the Company recorded   $13.7 million   in total incremental accretion during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of $  7.5 million   from the prior year period. The Company s operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased to   4.02%   from   4.18%   due to lower yielding originated loans (see footnote 1 in prior table). 
   
  Provision for Loan and Lease Losses 
  Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Company recorded a   $1.9 million   provision expense compared with a provision expense of   $2.8 million   during the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   $1.9 million   net provision for loan and lease losses recorded during the current quarter was driven by loans, excluding PCI loans, which was   $2.3 million  . Net provision recapture for PCI loans was   $433 thousand  . The $2.3 million provision for loans, excluding PCI loans, was due to growth in the loan portfolio and net charge-off activity. The provision recapture recorded relating to PCI loans was due to the increase in the present value of expected future cash flows as remeasured during the current quarter, compared to the present value of expected future cash flows measured during the second quarter of 2016. The amount of provision was calculated in accordance with the Company s methodology for determining the allowance, discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in  Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)  of this report.

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 
  The provision for loan and lease losses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $10.8 million   compared with provision expense of   $6.2 million   during the same period in   2015  . The   $10.8 million   provision expense for loans recorded for the current year-to-date period included a provision of   $10.4 million   for loans, excluding PCI loans and a provision of   $311 thousand   related to PCI loans. The provision of   $10.4 million   related to loans, excluding PCI loans, was due to the combination of loan growth and net loan charge-offs experienced in the period. The   $311 thousand   in provision expense for PCI loans was primarily due to the decrease in the present value of expected future cash flows as remeasured during the current period, compared to the present value of expected future cash flows at the end of   2015  , net of activity during the period. The amount of provision was calculated in accordance with the Company s methodology for determining the allowance, discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in  Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)  of this report. 
   
  Noninterest Income 
  The following table presents the significant components of noninterest income and the related dollar and percentage change from period to period: 

__________ 
  (1) Reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation. Reclassifications consisted of disaggregating fee revenue previously presented in  Service charges and other fees  and certain revenue previously presented in  Other  into the presentation above. The Company made these reclassifications to provide additional information about its sources of noninterest income. There was no change to total noninterest income as previously reported as a result of these reclassifications. 
  Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 
  Noninterest income was   $23.2 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $22.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase was due to lower expenses from the FDIC loss-sharing asset, partially offset by lower financial services revenue which is sensitive to stock market volatility and lower other noninterest income. 
  The change in the FDIC loss-sharing asset has been a significant component of noninterest income. Changes in the asset are primarily driven by amortization of the asset, the provision recorded for reimbursable losses on covered loans and write-downs of covered other real estate owned ( OREO ). For the   third   quarter of   2016  , the change in the asset was primarily driven by   $315 thousand   of amortization of the asset. For additional information on the FDIC loss-sharing asset, please see the  FDIC Loss-sharing Asset  section of this Management s Discussion and Analysis and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in  Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)  of this report.

Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , noninterest income was   $65.8 million   compared to   $66.7 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease was due to lower financial services revenue which is sensitive to stock market volatility as well as lower other noninterest income, partially offset by higher card revenue. Card revenue, which consists principally of debit card interchange and ATM fees, was up   $903 thousand  , principally from higher interchange fees driven by higher transaction volumes. 
   
  Noninterest Expense 
  The following table presents the significant components of noninterest expense and the related dollar and percentage change from period to period: 

The following table shows the impact of the acquisition-related expenses for the periods indicated to the various components of noninterest expense: 

__________ 
  (1) There were no acquisition-related expenses recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and all of the acquisition-related expenses recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were related to the 2014 acquisition of Intermountain Community Bancorp ( Intermountain ). Substantially all of the $9.0 million in acquisition-related expenses recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were related to the Intermountain acquisition.

Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 
  Total noninterest expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $67.3 million  , an increase of   $3.2 million  , or   5%   from the prior year period. The increase was due to higher compensation and employee benefits, driven by $1.4 million higher health insurance costs as well as higher incentive compensation expense. Also contributing to the increased noninterest expense was higher advertising costs, which were the result of refreshed television commercials and the associated media costs during the current quarter. 
  Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , noninterest expense was   $196.1 million  , a decrease of   $3.1 million  , or   2%   from   $199.3 million   a year earlier. The decrease from the prior year period was partially due to lower acquisition-related expenses. After removing the effect of the acquisition-related expenses, noninterest expense for the current year-to-date period was   $3.5 million   higher than the prior year period on the same basis. This increase was due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense as well as lower net OREO benefit, partially offset by lower legal and professional fees. The higher compensation and employee benefits were a result of higher health insurance costs in the current period. 
  The following table presents selected items included in other noninterest expense and the associated change from period to period: 

__________ 
  (1) Reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation. The reclassification was limited to creating new lines within other noninterest expense. There were no changes to previously reported total other noninterest expense as a result of these reclassifications. 
  Comparison of current quarter to prior year period 
  Other noninterest expense decreased   $617 thousand   due to lower fraud losses as well as decreases in postage, travel and entertainment and FDIC clawback expense. These decreases were partially offset by increased software support and maintenance expense in the current quarter. 
  Comparison of current year-to-date to prior year period 
  Other noninterest expense decreased   $1.7 million   due to lower acquisition-related expenses and lower fraud losses, partially offset by higher software support and maintenance in the current period.

FDIC Acquired Loan Accounting 
  The loss-sharing provisions for four of our eight FDIC loss-sharing agreements have expired. In addition, the balance of our FDIC-acquired loan portfolios continues to diminish over time. As a result, the significance of FDIC acquired loan accounting to our results of operations has also diminished. The following table illustrates the impact to earnings associated with the Company s FDIC acquired loan portfolios for the periods indicated: 
   
 __________ 
  (1) For 2016, incremental accretion income on other FDIC acquired loans is no longer considered significant. 
  (2) For additional information on the FDIC loss-sharing asset, please see the  FDIC Loss-sharing Asset  section of this Management s Discussion and Analysis and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in  Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)  of this report. 
   
  Income Taxes 
  We recorded an income tax provision of   $12.1 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to a provision of   $11.5 million   for the same period in   2015  , with an effective tax rate of   31%   for both periods. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded income tax provisions of   $32.6 million   and   $32.2 million  , respectively, with an effective tax rate of   31%   for both periods. Our effective tax rate remains lower than the statutory tax rate due to the amount of tax-exempt municipal securities held in the investment portfolio, tax-exempt earnings on bank owned life insurance and loans with favorable tax attributes. For additional information, please refer to the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  FINANCIAL CONDITION 
   
  Total assets were   $9.59 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $635.1 million   from   $8.95 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Loan growth of   $444.7 million   during the current year was driven by strong loan originations. Loan production was diversified across the portfolio, but was centered in commercial business loans. Securities available for sale were   $2.36 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $202.4 million   from   December 31, 2015  . Total liabilities were   $8.31 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $600.5 million   from   $7.71 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to increased deposits. 
   
  Investment Securities Available for Sale 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held investment securities totaling   $2.36 billion   compared to   $2.16 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in the investment securities portfolio from year-end is due to $502.6 million in purchases and a $35.3 million increase in the net unrealized gain of securities in the portfolio, partially offset by $319.3 million in principal payments, maturities and sales and $16.2 million in premium amortization. The average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately 3 years and 10 months at   September 30, 2016  . This duration takes into account calls, where appropriate, and consensus prepayment speeds.  
  The investment securities are used by the Company as a component of its balance sheet management strategies. From time-to-time, securities may be sold to reposition the portfolio in response to strategies developed by the Company s asset liability committee. In accordance with our investment strategy, management monitors market conditions with a view to realize gains on its available for sale securities portfolio when prudent. 
  The Company performs a quarterly assessment of the debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio that have an unrealized loss to determine whether the decline in the fair value of these securities below their amortized cost basis is other-

than-temporary. Impairment is considered other-than-temporary when it becomes probable that the Company will be unable to recover the entire amortized cost basis of its investment. The Company s impairment assessment takes into consideration factors such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, defaults or deferrals of scheduled interest or principal, external credit ratings and recent downgrades, internal assessment of credit quality, and whether the Company intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. If a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value which then becomes the new cost basis. The new cost basis is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value. 
  When there are credit losses associated with an impaired debt security and the Company does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, the Company will separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit-related and the amount related to non-credit factors. The credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings and the non-credit-related impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the market value of securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of   $35.4 million   compared to a net unrealized gain of   $84 thousand   at   December 31, 2015  . The change in valuation was the result of fluctuations in market interest rates subsequent to purchase. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $404.7 million   of investment securities with gross unrealized losses of   $3.1 million  ; however, we did not consider these investment securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

  Credit Risk Management 
  The extension of credit in the form of loans or other credit substitutes to individuals and businesses is one of our principal commerce activities. Our policies, applicable laws, and regulations require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management. We manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints, credit review, approval policies, and extensive, ongoing internal monitoring. We also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan, type of industry and type of borrower and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower. 
  In analyzing our existing portfolio, we review our consumer and residential loan portfolios by their performance as a pool of loans, since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating, size or potential risk of loss. In contrast, the monitoring process for the commercial business, real estate construction, and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loan-by-loan basis. 
  
    48 

     Table of Contents   

We review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and, as a result, the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly. In the event that full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured, the loan is appropriately downgraded and, if warranted, placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments. Additionally, we assess whether an impairment of a loan warrants specific reserves or a write-down of the loan. For additional discussion on our methodology in managing credit risk within our loan portfolio, see the  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses  section in this Management s Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  of the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Loan policies, credit quality criteria, portfolio guidelines and other controls are established under the guidance of our Chief Credit Officer and approved, as appropriate, by the board of directors. Credit Administration, together with the management loan committee, has the responsibility for administering the credit approval process. As another part of its control process, we use an internal credit review and examination function to provide reasonable assurance that loans and commitments are made and maintained as prescribed by our credit policies. This includes a review of documentation when the loan is initially extended and subsequent examination to ensure continued performance and proper risk assessment. 
   
  Loan Portfolio Analysis 
  Our wholly owned banking subsidiary Columbia State Bank is a full service commercial bank, which originates a wide variety of loans, and focuses its lending efforts on originating commercial business and commercial real estate loans. 
  The following table sets forth the Company s loan portfolio by type of loan for the dates indicated:   

  Total loans increased   $444.7 million   from year-end   2015  . The loan growth was driven by substantial loan production during the first nine months of the year, partially offset by contractual payments and prepayments. The loan portfolio continues to be diversified, with the intent to mitigate risk by monitoring concentration in any one sector. The   $36.2 million   in unearned income recorded at   September 30, 2016   was comprised of $23.3 million in discount on acquired loans and $12.9 million in deferred loan fees. The   $42.4 million   in unearned income recorded at   December 31, 2015   consisted of $32.2 million in discount on acquired loans and $10.2 million in deferred loan fees.

     Table of Contents   

The following table provides additional detail related to the net discount of acquired and purchased loans, excluding PCI loans, by acquisition:   

  Commercial Loans:   We are committed to providing competitive commercial lending in our primary market areas. Management expects a continued focus within its commercial lending products and to emphasize, in particular, relationship banking with businesses and business owners. 
  Real Estate Loans:   One-to-four family residential loans are secured by properties located within our primary market areas and, typically, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or lower at origination. Our underwriting standards for commercial and multifamily residential loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio for these loans not exceed 75% of appraised value, cost, or discounted cash flow value, as appropriate, and that commercial properties maintain debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt servicing) of 1.2 or better. However, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. We endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 
  Real Estate Construction Loans:   We originate a variety of real estate construction loans. Underwriting guidelines for these loans vary by loan type but include loan-to-value limits, term limits and loan advance limits, as applicable. Our underwriting guidelines for commercial and multifamily residential real estate construction loans generally require that the loan-to-value ratio not exceed 75% and stabilized debt coverage ratios (net operating income divided by annual debt servicing) of 1.2 or better. As noted above, underwriting standards can be influenced by competition and other factors. However, we endeavor to maintain the highest practical underwriting standards while balancing the need to remain competitive in our lending practices. 
  Consumer Loans:   Consumer loans include automobile loans, boat and recreational vehicle financing, home equity and home improvement loans and miscellaneous personal loans. 
  Foreign Loans:   The Company has no material foreign activities. Substantially all of the Company s loans and unfunded commitments are geographically concentrated in its service areas within the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. 
  Purchased Credit Impaired Loans:   PCI loans are comprised of loans and loan commitments acquired in connection with the 2011 FDIC-assisted acquisitions of First Heritage Bank and Summit Bank, as well as the 2010 FDIC-assisted acquisitions of Columbia River Bank and American Marine Bank. PCI loans are generally accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30,   Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality   ( ASC 310-30 ).  
  For additional information on our loan portfolio, including amounts pledged as collateral on borrowings, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in  Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited)  of this report. 
   
  Nonperforming Assets 
  Nonperforming assets consist of: (i) nonaccrual loans, which generally are loans placed on a nonaccrual basis when the loan becomes past due 90 days or when there are otherwise serious doubts about the collectability of principal or interest within the existing terms of the loan, (ii) OREO; and (iii) other personal property owned, if applicable. 
  Nonaccrual loans  :   The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared according to the accrual basis of accounting. This includes the recognition of interest income on the loan portfolio, unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, which occurs when there are serious doubts about the collectability of principal or interest. Our policy is generally to discontinue the accrual of interest on all loans past due 90 days or more and place them on nonaccrual status. Loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 are generally considered accruing and performing as the loans accrete interest income over the estimated lives of the loans when cash flows are reasonably estimable. Accordingly, PCI loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 that are contractually past due are still considered to be accruing and performing loans.

     Table of Contents   

The following table sets forth, at the dates indicated, information with respect to our nonaccrual loans and total nonperforming assets: 

At   September 30, 2016  , nonperforming assets were   $30.4 million  , compared to   $35.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Nonperforming assets decreased $4.8 million during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to OREO sales during the period. 
  Other Real Estate Owned:   The following table sets forth activity in OREO for the periods indicated: 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
  We record an allowance to recognize management s estimate of credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. Management s allowance estimate is measured quarterly and the primary components include allowances related to: 
           1. 
    Loans collectively evaluated for impairment under the Contingencies topic of the FASB ASC.  
              2. 
    Loans individually determined to be impaired in accordance with the Receivables topic of the FASB ASC. 
              3. 
    Purchased credit impaired loans accounted for under the Receivables topic of the FASB ASC. 
     
    51 

     Table of Contents   

On a quarterly basis, our Chief Credit Officer reviews with executive management and the board of directors the various factors that management considers when determining the adequacy of the allowance. These factors include the following: 
             
    Existing general economic and business conditions affecting our market place 
                
    Credit quality trends 
                
    Historical loss experience 
                
    Seasoning of the loan portfolio 
                
    Bank regulatory examination results 
                
    Findings of internal credit examiners 
                
    Duration of current business cycle 
                
    Specific loss estimates for problem loans 
     The allowance is increased by provisions for loan and lease losses ( provision ) charged to expense, and is reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries or recapture of previous provision. While we believe the best information available is used to determine the allowance, changes in conditions could result in adjustments to the allowance, affecting net income, if circumstances differ from management s assumptions. In addition, the allowance may include an unallocated amount to recognize factors inherent in our loan portfolio not otherwise contemplated. Any unallocated amount generally comprises less than   5%   of the allowance. 
  For loans individually determined to be impaired, the Company measures impairment on a loan-by-loan basis using either the discounted expected future cash flows, observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent or if foreclosure is probable. A specific reserve for such loans is recognized to the extent the measured value is less than the loan s recorded investment.  
  PCI loans are accounted for under ASC 310-30 and initially measured at fair value based on expected future cash flows over the life of the loans. PCI loans that have common risk characteristics are aggregated into pools. The Company re-measures contractual and expected loan cash flows, at the pool-level, on a quarterly basis. If, due to credit deterioration, the present value of expected cash flows, as periodically re-measured, is less than the carrying value of the loan pool, the Company adjusts the carrying value of the loan pool to the lower amount by adjusting the allowance with a charge to earnings through the provision for loan losses. If the present value of expected cash flows is greater than the carrying value of the loan pool, the Company adjusts the carrying value of the loan pool to a higher amount by recapturing previously recorded allowance for loan losses, if any. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our allowance was   $70.3 million  , or   1.12%   of total loans (excluding loans held for sale). This compares with an allowance of   $68.2 million  , or   1.17%   of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at   December 31, 2015   and an allowance of   $69.0 million   or   1.20%   of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at   September 30, 2015  . 
  In addition to the allowance, we recognize a liability for unfunded commitments and letters of credit. We report this amount in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We measure this amount based upon our estimates of the probability of funding and losses related to those credit exposures. This methodology is similar to how we measure our allowance. For additional information on the liability for unfunded commitments and letters of credit, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this report.

FDIC Loss-sharing Asset 
  The Company has elected to account for amounts receivable under loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC as an indemnification asset in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC. The FDIC indemnification asset is initially recorded at fair value, based on the discounted expected future cash flows under the loss-sharing agreements. 
  Subsequent to initial recognition, the FDIC indemnification asset is reviewed quarterly and adjusted for any changes in expected cash flows. These adjustments are measured on the same basis as the related covered loans. Any decrease in expected cash flows on the covered loans due to an increase in expected credit losses will increase the FDIC indemnification asset and any increase in expected future cash flows on the covered loans due to a decrease in expected credit losses will decrease the FDIC indemnification asset. Changes in the estimated cash flows on covered assets that are immediately recognized in income generally result in a similar immediate adjustment to the loss-sharing asset while changes in expected cash flows on covered assets that are accounted for as an adjustment to yield generally result in adjustments to the amortization or accretion rate for the loss-sharing asset. Increases and decreases to the FDIC loss-sharing asset are recorded as adjustments to noninterest income. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the FDIC loss-sharing asset was   $3.6 million  , which was comprised of a   $3.2 million   FDIC indemnification asset and a   $438 thousand   FDIC receivable. The FDIC receivable represents the amounts due from the FDIC for claims related to covered losses the Company has incurred net of amounts due to the FDIC relating to shared recoveries. 
  The following table summarizes the activity related to the FDIC loss-sharing asset for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :   

  For additional information on the FDIC loss-sharing asset, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this report. 
   
  Liquidity and Sources of Funds 
  Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits. Additionally, we utilize advances from the FHLB of Des Moines ( FHLB ), the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( FRB ), and term and sweep repurchase agreements to supplement our funding needs. These funds, together with loan repayments, loan sales, retained earnings, equity and other borrowed funds are used to make loans, to acquire securities and other assets, and to fund continuing operations. 
  In addition, we have a shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities, depositary shares, purchase contracts, units and warrants in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding the terms of and the securities being offered will be provided at the time of any offering. Proceeds from any future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding securities, working capital, funding future acquisitions or other purposes identified at the time of any offering.

Deposit Activities 
  Our deposit products include a wide variety of transaction accounts, savings accounts and time deposit accounts. Core deposits (demand deposit, savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit less than $250,000) increased   $570.4 million   since year-end   2015  .  
  We have established a branch system to serve our consumer and business depositors. In addition, management s strategy for funding asset growth is to make use of brokered and other wholesale deposits on an as-needed basis. The Company participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS       ) program. CDARS        is a network that allows participating banks to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on time deposits. The Company also participates in a similar program to offer extended FDIC deposit insurance coverage on money market accounts. These extended deposit insurance programs are generally available only to existing customers and are not used as a means of generating additional liquidity. At   September 30, 2016  , CDARS        deposits and brokered money market deposits were   $169.1 million  , or   2%   of total deposits, compared to   $127.8 million   at year-end   2015  . The brokered deposits have varied maturities. 
  The following table sets forth the Company s deposit base by type of product for the dates indicated: 
   
 __________ 
  (1) Reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation. The reclassification was limited to changing the threshold for certificates of deposit presented to the current FDIC insurance limit. 
  Borrowings 
  We rely on FHLB advances and FRB borrowings as another source of both short and long-term funding. FHLB advances and FRB borrowings are secured by bonds within our investment portfolio, and residential, commercial and commercial real estate loans. At   September 30, 2016  , we had FHLB advances of   $66.5 million   compared to   $68.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  We also utilize wholesale and retail repurchase agreements as a supplement to our funding sources. Our wholesale repurchase agreements are secured by mortgage-backed securities. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had term repurchase agreements of $25.0 million, which mature in 2018, and deposit customer sweep-related repurchase agreements of $44.2 million and $74.7 million, respectively, which mature on a daily basis. Management anticipates we will continue to rely on FHLB advances, FRB borrowings, and wholesale and retail repurchase agreements in the future and we will use those funds primarily to make loans and purchase securities. 
   
  Contractual Obligations, Commitments   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We are party to many contractual financial obligations, including repayment of borrowings, operating and equipment lease payments, off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit and investments in affordable housing partnerships. At   September 30, 2016  , we had commitments to extend credit of $2.15 billion compared to $1.98 billion at   December 31, 2015  .

Capital Resources 
  Shareholders  equity at   September 30, 2016   was   $1.28 billion  , an increase from   $1.24 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Shareholders  equity was   13%   and   14%   of total period-end assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Capital Ratios  : Basel III capital requirements and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the  New Capital Rules ) became effective on January 1, 2015. The New Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure called  Common Equity Tier 1,  or CET1, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and  Additional Tier 1 capital  instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the requirements that are now effective, the minimum capital ratios are now (i) 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 6% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, (iii) 8% total capital to risk-weighted assets and (iv) 4% Tier 1 leverage. The Company and the Bank have made the one-time election to opt-out of including accumulated other comprehensive income items in regulatory capital calculations. 
  The New Capital Rules also require a capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. In addition, the New Capital Rules provide for a countercyclical capital buffer applicable only to certain covered institutions. We do not expect the countercyclical capital buffer to be applicable to us or the Bank. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 
  The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased-in over a three-year period (increasing by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). When fully phased-in, the New Capital Rules will require us, and the Bank, to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) 7% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and (iii) 10.5% total capital to risk-weighted assets. At   September 30, 2016  , the capital conservation buffer was   4.4132%   and   4.2350%   for the Company and Bank, respectively. Therefore, we met all capital adequacy requirements under the New Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis as if all such requirements were in effect at   September 30, 2016  . 
  FDIC regulations set forth the qualifications necessary for a bank to be classified as  well capitalized,  primarily for assignment of FDIC insurance premium rates. To qualify as  well capitalized,  banks must have a CET1 risk-adjusted capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier I risk-adjusted capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-adjusted capital ratio of at least 10% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%. Failure to qualify as  well capitalized  can negatively impact a bank s ability to expand and to engage in certain activities.  
  The Company and its banking subsidiary qualified as  well-capitalized  at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The following table presents the capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, as applicable, for the Company and its banking subsidiary at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :    

  Stock Repurchase Program  
  In June 2016, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program which succeeds the prior program that was adopted in October 2011. The program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to 2.9 million shares of our outstanding common stock, representing approximately 5% of the common shares outstanding. The Company intends to purchase the shares from time to time in the open market or in private transactions, under conditions which allow such repurchases to be accretive to earnings per share while maintaining capital ratios that exceed the guidelines for a well-capitalized financial institution.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The Company considers operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to be an important measurement as it more closely reflects the ongoing operating performance of the Company. Additionally, presentation of the operating net interest margin allows readers to compare certain aspects of the Company s net interest margin to other organizations. Despite the importance of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the Company, there is no standardized definition for it and, as a result, the Company s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. The Company encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 
    
  The following table reconciles the Company s calculation of the operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to the net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the periods indicated: 

__________ 
  (1) Tax-exempt interest income has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis. The amount of such adjustment was an addition to net interest income of   $2.7 million   and   $2.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and an addition to net interest income of   $8.0 million   and   $7.2 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  (2)   For 2016, incremental accretion income on other FDIC acquired loans is no longer considered significant and will no longer be tracked for this non-GAAP financial measure.

Item 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     A number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk, including income simulations and interest sensitivity (gap) analysis. An income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates. Basic assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets, cash flows and maturities of other investment securities, loan and deposit volumes and pricing. These assumptions are inherently subjective and, as a result, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. At   September 30, 2016  , based on the measures used to monitor and manage interest rate risk, there has not been a material change in the Company s interest rate risk since   December 31, 2015  . For additional information, refer to Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) accumulated and communicated to our management (including the CEO and CFO) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
