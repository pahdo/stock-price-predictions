EXPLANATORY NOTE 
    
  This report combines the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   of VEREIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, of which VEREIT, Inc. is the sole general partner. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to  we,   us,   our,   VEREIT,  the  Company  or the  General Partner  mean VEREIT, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P., and all references to the  Operating Partnership  or  OP  mean VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries.  
  As the sole general partner of VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P., VEREIT, Inc. has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and control. 
  We believe combining the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of VEREIT, Inc. and VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P. into this single report results in the following benefits: 
             
    enhancing investors  understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;  
                
    eliminating duplicative disclosure and providing a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Company and the Operating Partnership; and  
                
    creating time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.  
     There are a few differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, which are reflected in the disclosure in this report. We believe it is important to understand the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as an interrelated consolidated company. VEREIT, Inc. is a real estate investment trust whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. As a result, VEREIT, Inc. does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity or debt from time to time and guaranteeing certain unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company and holds the ownership interests in the Company s joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by VEREIT, Inc., which are generally contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company s business through the Operating Partnership s operations, by the Operating Partnership s direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of partnership units. To help investors understand the significant differences between VEREIT, Inc. and the Operating Partnership, there are separate sections in this report that separately discuss VEREIT, Inc. and the Operating Partnership, including the consolidated financial statements and certain notes to the consolidated financial statements as well as separate Exhibit 31 and Exhibit 32 certifications. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, VEREIT, Inc. consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of VEREIT, Inc. and VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P. are the same on their respective consolidated financial statements. The separate discussions of VEREIT, Inc. and VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P. in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company.

Note 1     Organization    
  VEREIT        is a Maryland corporation, incorporated on December 2, 2010, that qualified as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning in the taxable year ended December 31, 2011. VEREIT Operating Partnership, L.P. (together with its subsidiaries, the  Operating Partnership  or the  OP ), is a Delaware limited partnership of which the General Partner is the sole general partner. VEREIT s common stock, par value   $0.01   per share ( Common Stock ), and its   6.70%   Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value   $0.01   per share ( Series F Preferred Stock ) trade on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the trading symbols,  VER  and  VER PRF,  respectively. As used herein, the terms the  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to VEREIT, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including the OP. 
  The Company is a full-service real estate operating company with investment management capabilities that operates through   two   reportable segments, its real estate investment ( REI ) segment and its investment management segment, Cole Capital        ( Cole Capital ), as further discussed in   Note 3       Segment Reporting  . Through the REI segment, the Company owns and actively manages a diversified portfolio of retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate properties subject to long-term net leases with creditworthy tenants. The Company actively manages its portfolio considering a number of metrics including property type, concentration and key economic factors for appropriate balance and diversity. Through the Cole Capital segment, the Company is responsible for raising capital for and managing the affairs of the Cole REITs        (as defined in   Note 3       Segment Reporting  ) on a day-to-day basis, identifying and making acquisitions and investments on the Cole REITs  behalf, and recommending to the respective board of directors of each of the Cole REITs an approach for providing investors with liquidity. Cole Capital receives compensation and reimbursement for performing these services. To support both reportable segments, the Company employs a shared services model pursuant to which its personnel are integral in providing, among other things, transactional and operational functions to the Company s owned portfolio and the Cole REITs.  
  Substantially all of the REI segment s operations are conducted through the OP. VEREIT is the sole general partner and holder of   97.6%   of the common equity interests in the OP as of   September 30, 2016   with the remaining   2.4%   of the common equity interests owned by unaffiliated investors and certain former directors, officers and employees of ARC Properties Advisors, LLC (the  Former Manager ). Under the limited partnership agreement of the OP, as amended (the  LPA ), after holding units of limited partner interests in the OP ( OP Units ) for a period of   one year  , unless an earlier redemption is otherwise consented to by VEREIT, holders of OP Units have the right to redeem the OP Units for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of VEREIT s Common Stock or, at the option of VEREIT, a corresponding number of shares of VEREIT s Common Stock. The remaining rights of the holders of OP Units are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the General Partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP s assets.  
  Substantially all of the Cole Capital segment s operations are conducted through Cole Capital Advisors, Inc. ( CCA ), an Arizona corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the OP. CCA is treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ) under Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Internal Revenue Code ).  
  The actions of the OP and its relationship with the General Partner are governed by the LPA. The General Partner does not have any significant assets other than its investment in the OP. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the General Partner and the OP are substantially the same. Additionally, pursuant to the LPA, all administrative expenses and expenses associated with the formation, continuity, existence and operation of the General Partner incurred by the General Partner on the OP s behalf shall be treated as expenses of the OP. Further, when the General Partner issues any equity instrument that has been approved by the General Partner s board of directors, the LPA requires the OP to issue to the General Partner equity instruments with substantially similar terms, to protect the integrity of the Company s umbrella partnership REIT structure, pursuant to which each holder of interests in the OP has a proportionate economic interest in the OP reflecting its capital contributions thereto. OP Units issued to the General Partner are referred to as General Partner OP Units. OP Units issued to parties other than the General Partner are referred to as Limited Partner OP Units. The LPA also provides that the OP issue debt with terms and provisions consistent with debt issued by the General Partner. The LPA will be amended to provide for the issuance of any additional class of equivalent equity instruments to the extent the General Partner s board of directors authorizes the issuance of any new class of equity securities.

Note 2       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
  Basis of Accounting  
  The consolidated financial statements of the Company presented herein include the accounts of the General Partner and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the OP. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. The financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ). The information furnished includes all adjustments and accruals of a normal recurring nature, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of results for the interim periods. The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year or any subsequent interim period.  
  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company, which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 24, 2016. There have been no significant changes to the Company s significant accounting policies during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and U.S. GAAP. 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and consolidated joint venture arrangements. The portions of the consolidated joint venture arrangements not owned by the Company are presented as non-controlling interests in VEREIT s and the OP s consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of comprehensive income (loss) and statements of changes in equity. In addition, as described in   Note 1     Organization  , certain third parties have been issued OP Units. Holders of OP Units are considered to be non-controlling interest holders in the OP and their ownership interest in the limited partner s share is presented as non-controlling interests in VEREIT s consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of comprehensive income (loss) and statements of changes in equity. Further, a portion of the earnings and losses of the OP are allocated to non-controlling interest holders based on their respective ownership percentages. Upon conversion of OP Units to Common Stock, any difference between the fair value of shares of Common Stock issued and the carrying value of the OP Units converted is recorded as a component of equity. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were approximately   23.75 million   and   23.76 million   Limited Partner OP Units outstanding, respectively.  
    
  For legal entities being evaluated for consolidation, the Company must first determine whether the interests that it holds and fees it receives qualify as variable interests in the entity. A variable interest is an investment or other interest that will absorb portions of an entity s expected losses or receive portions of the entity s expected residual returns. The Company s evaluation includes consideration of fees paid to the Company where the Company acts as a decision maker or service provider to the entity being evaluated. If the Company determines that it holds a variable interest in an entity, it evaluates whether that entity is a variable interest entity ( VIE ). VIEs are entities where investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or where equity investors, as a group, lack one of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, (b) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (c) the right to receive the expected returns of the entity. 
  The Company then qualitatively assesses whether it is (or is not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE, which is generally defined as the party who has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. Consideration of various factors include, but are not limited to, the Company s ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and its obligation to absorb losses from or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company consolidates any VIEs when the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and the difference between consolidating the VIE and accounting for it using the equity method could be material to the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company continually evaluates the need to consolidate these VIEs based on standards set forth in U.S. GAAP. 
  Reclassification 
  As described below, the following items previously reported have been reclassified to conform with the current period s presentation.

The land and construction in progress line item from prior periods has been combined into the land caption in the consolidated balance sheets. The gain on forgiveness of debt previously included in other income, net has been combined into the caption   (loss) gain on extinguishment and forgiveness of debt, net   in the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures previously included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations has been included in a separate caption entitled equity in income and gain on disposition of unconsolidated entities. Insurance recoveries previously included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations has been included in litigation and other non-routine costs, net of insurance recoveries. 
  Restricted Cash  
  The Company had   $61.8 million   and   $59.8 million  , respectively, in restricted cash as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Restricted cash primarily consists of reserves related to lease expirations, as well as maintenance, structural and debt service reserves. In accordance with certain debt agreements, rent from certain of the Company s tenants is deposited directly into a lockbox account, from which the monthly debt service payments are disbursed to the lender and the excess funds are then disbursed to the Company. Included in restricted cash at   September 30, 2016   was   $52.2 million   in lender reserves and   $9.6 million   held in restricted lockbox accounts. Included in restricted cash at   December 31, 2015   was   $47.9 million   in lender reserves and   $11.9 million   held in restricted lockbox accounts.  
  Revenue Recognition   REI 
  The Company s revenues, which primarily consist of rental income and include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial non-cancelable term of the lease, are recognized when earned and collectability is reasonably assured. When the Company acquires a property, the term of each existing lease is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation. Since many of the leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires the Company to record a receivable, and include in revenues, straight-line rent receivables that the Company will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. Straight-line rent receivables are included in rent and tenant receivables and other assets, net, in the consolidated balance sheets. See   Note 8     Rent and Tenant Receivables and Other Assets, Net  . Cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursements in the consolidated statements of operations in the period the related costs are incurred. The Company defers the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $70.9 million   and   $67.2 million  , respectively, of deferred rental income, which is included in deferred rent, derivative and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.  
  The Company continually reviews receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determines collectability by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. In the event that the collectability of a receivable is uncertain, the Company will record an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts in the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to rental income. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company maintained an allowance for uncollectible accounts of   $8.3 million   and   $6.6 million  , respectively. 
  Revenue Recognition   Cole Capital  
  Revenue includes securities sales commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution and stockholder servicing fees, real estate acquisition fees, financing coordination fees, property management fees, advisory fees, asset management fees and performance fees for services relating to the Cole REITs  offerings and the investment and management of their respective assets, in accordance with the respective dealer manager and advisory agreements. The Company records dealer manager fees, excluding those related to INAV (as defined in   Note 3       Segment Reporting  ), and securities sales commissions as revenue upon the sale of Cole REIT shares. Dealer manager fees from the sale of INAV shares and distribution and stockholder servicing fees are recorded as revenue when the fees are fixed or determinable. The Company records revenue related to acquisition and financing coordination fees upon completion of a transaction and advisory, asset and property management fees as services are performed. The Company is also reimbursed for certain costs incurred in providing these services. Securities sales commissions and dealer manager reimbursements are recorded as revenue as the expenses are incurred, as long as reimbursement is reasonably assured. The Company, in its sole discretion, may reallow all or a portion of its dealer manager fee to such participating broker-dealers as a marketing and due diligence expense reimbursement, based on factors such as the volume of shares issued by such participating broker-dealers and the amount of marketing support provided by such participating broker-dealers. The Company also reallows   100%   of selling commissions earned to participating broker-dealers. Refer to   Note 17       Related Party Transactions and Arrangements   for further discussion. In addition, the Company earns property management, asset management and disposition fees from certain joint ventures and other real estate programs.

  All costs incurred as a result of a business combination are classified as acquisition related expenses or other non-routine transaction related expenses and expensed as incurred. Acquisition related expenses include legal and other transaction related costs incurred in connection with self-originated acquisitions, including purchases of portfolios. In addition, indirect costs, such as internal salaries, that are tracked and documented in a manner that clearly indicates that the activities driving the cost directly relate to activities necessary to complete, or effect, self-originating purchases are classified as acquisition related expenses.  
  Similar costs incurred in relation to mergers (which are not considered self-originating purchases) and litigation resulting therefrom and other non-routine transactions are included in litigation and other non-routine costs, net of insurance recoveries in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company has also incurred legal fees and other costs associated with the Audit Committee Investigation (defined below) and the litigations and investigations resulting therefrom, which are considered non-routine. The Company has directors  and officers  insurance and the insurance carriers have paid certain defense costs subject to standard reservation of rights under the respective policies.  
  Litigation and other non-routine costs include the following costs (amounts in thousands): 

___________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Includes all fees and costs associated with the previously-announced investigation conducted by the audit committee (the  Audit Committee ) of the General Partner s board of directors (the  Audit Committee Investigation ) and various litigations and investigations prompted by the results of the Audit Committee Investigation, including fees and costs incurred pursuant to the Company s advancement obligations.  
              (2) 
    The negative balance for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is a result of estimated costs accrued in prior periods that exceeded actual expenses incurred.  
              (3) 
    Primarily relates to fees incurred in connection with a legal matter resolved in early 2014.  
        Income Taxes 
  The General Partner currently qualifies and has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, except as discussed below, the General Partner generally is not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that it distributes to its stockholders so long as it distributes at least 90% of its annual taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains). REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if the General Partner maintains its qualification for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, federal income taxes on certain income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. 
  The OP is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the OP is not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Instead, each partner in the OP is required to take into account its allocable share of the OP s income, gains, losses, deductions and credits for each taxable year. However, the OP may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the OP and the General Partner had no material uncertain income tax positions. The tax years subsequent to and including the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the OP, the General Partner, American Realty Capital Trust III, Inc. ( ARCT III ), CapLease, Inc. ( CapLease ), American Realty Capital Trust IV, Inc., ( ARCT IV ), Cole Real Estate Investments, Inc. ( Cole ) and Cole Credit Property Trust, Inc. are subject. 
  Under the LPA, the OP is to conduct business in such a manner as to permit the General Partner at all times to qualify as a REIT.

The Company conducts substantially all of its Cole Capital segment business activities through a TRS. A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to corporate federal, state and local income taxes, as applicable. The Company s use of a TRS enables it to engage in certain business activities while complying with the REIT qualification requirements and to retain any income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement to distribute those earnings. The Company conducts all of its business in the United States and Canada and, as a result, it files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, the Canadian federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions. Certain of the Company s inter-company transactions that have been eliminated in consolidation for financial accounting purposes are also subject to taxation.  
  The Company provides for income taxes in accordance with current authoritative accounting and tax guidance. The tax provision or benefit related to significant or unusual items is recognized in the quarter in which those items occur. In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws, rates or tax status is recognized in the quarter in which the change occurs. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision for or benefit from income taxes may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained or the tax environment changes. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update, ( ASU )  2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Revenue Recognition, Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) (Topic 605) and requires an entity to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, an amendment to ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14 ), was issued to defer the effective date for all entities by one year. For public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities and certain employee benefit plans, the guidance should be applied to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company has identified its revenue streams and is in the process of evaluating the impact on its financial statements and internal accounting processes; however, as the majority of the Company s revenue is derived from real estate lease contracts, as discussed in relation to ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ), the Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 or related amendments and modifications issued by the FASB will have a material impact on its financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments     (Subtopic 825-10)  ,   which requires all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments in this update also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income, the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. In addition, the amendments in this update require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on its financial statements.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which will require that a lessee recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with a lease term of more than 12 months, with the result being the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability and the disclosure of key information about the entity's leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 retains a distinction between finance leases (i.e., capital leases under current U.S. GAAP) and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases will be substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases under current U.S. GAAP. The amendments in ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective approach is required for existing leases that have not expired upon adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this amendment will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05, Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships (Topic 815). The amendments in this update clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. These provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this amendment will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvement to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ), which affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. ASU 2016-09 is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeiture rate calculations. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance during the first quarter of 2016, which did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In connection with the adoption, the Company modified the consolidated statement of changes in equity to include the line item cumulative-effect adjustment for equity-based compensation forfeitures, which represents application of the accounting change on a modified retrospective basis.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investment in leases and other such commitments. ASU 2016-13 requires that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require the Company to measure all expected credit losses based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets and eliminates the  incurred loss  methodology in current GAAP. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this amendment will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ), which is intended to address diversity in practice related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues as well as application of the predominance principle (dependence on predominant source or use of receipt or payment) and are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. ASU 2016-15 requires retrospective adoption unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it is to be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this amendment will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
   
  Note 3       Segment Reporting    
  The Company has organized its operations into   two   segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes, REI and Cole Capital, as further discussed below.  
  REI     Through its REI segment, the Company owns and actively manages a diversified portfolio of retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate properties subject to long-term net leases with creditworthy tenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   4,213   properties comprising   96.9 million   square feet of retail and commercial space located in   49   states, Puerto Rico and Canada, which includes properties owned through consolidated joint ventures. The rentable space at these properties was   98.0%   leased with a weighted-average remaining lease term of   10.0   years. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   eight   commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) and   nine   mortgage notes receivable. 
  Cole Capital     Through its Cole Capital segment, the Company is responsible for managing the day-to-day affairs of Cole Credit Property Trust IV, Inc. ( CCPT IV  Cole Real Estate Income Strategy (Daily NAV), Inc. ( INAV  Cole Office   Industrial REIT (CCIT II), Inc. ( CCIT II  Cole Office   Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc. ( CCIT III ), Cole Credit Property Trust V, Inc. ( CCPT V  and other real estate offerings in registration (collectively with CCPT IV, INAV, CCIT II, CCIT III and CCPT V, the  Cole REITs ), raising capital for those Cole REITs still in offering, identifying and making acquisitions and investments on the Cole REITs  behalf and recommending to the respective board of directors of each of the Cole REITs an approach for providing investors with liquidity. Cole Capital serves as the dealer manager and distributes shares of common stock for certain Cole REITs and advises them regarding offerings, manages relationships with participating broker-dealers and financial advisors and provides assistance in connection with compliance matters relating to the offerings. Cole Capital receives compensation and reimbursement for services relating to the Cole REITs  offerings and the investment, management, financing and disposition of their respective assets, as applicable. Cole Capital also develops new REIT offerings and assists in obtaining regulatory approvals from the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. and various blue sky jurisdictions for such offerings. See   Note 17       Related Party Transactions and Arrangements   for further discussion on the Cole REITs.

Note 4       Goodwill and Other Intangibles    
  Goodwill 
  In connection with prior mergers, the Company recorded goodwill as a result of the merger consideration exceeding the net assets acquired. The goodwill recorded as a result of the merger of Cole with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the  Cole Merger ) was allocated between the Company s   two   segments, the REI segment and the Cole Capital segment. The REI segment and the Cole Capital segment each comprise   one   reporting unit. 
   In the event the Company disposes of a property that constitutes a business under U.S. GAAP, the Company will allocate a portion of the REI segment s goodwill to that property in determining the gain or loss on the disposal of the property. The amount of goodwill allocated to the property will be based on the relative fair value of the property to the fair value of the REI segment. Future property acquisitions that constitute a business will be integrated into the REI segment and therefore will also be allocated goodwill upon disposition.  
  The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value, by reporting unit, may not be recoverable. The analysis for the annual goodwill test is performed during the fourth quarter. The Company tests goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value or if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of the reporting units

using discounted cash flows and relevant competitor multiples. The evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment requires the Company s management to exercise significant judgment and to make certain assumptions. While the Company believes its assumptions are reasonable, there are no guarantees as to actual results. Changes in assumptions based on actual results may have a material impact on the Company s financial results.  
  The fair value of the Cole Capital segment is dependent upon actual results, including, but not limited to, the timing and amount of aggregate capital raised and deployed on behalf of the Cole REITs, which is influenced by the Company s ability to reinstate certain selling agreements that were suspended as a result of the Audit Committee Investigation and the resulting restatements, as well as regulatory requirements affecting broker-dealers. If the Company is unable to reinstate selling agreements or raise and deploy capital as estimated, the fair values of the Cole Capital segment and intangible assets may be less than the respective carrying value, resulting in an impairment that could have a material effect on the Company s financial results. In addition, the actual timing of closing an offering or executing a liquidity event on behalf of a Cole REIT or the commencement of operations of newly formed REITs, which are not yet effective, may differ from the Company s assumptions. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , management monitored the actual performance of the business segments relative to the fair value assumptions used during the annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, management determined it remains more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. 
  The following table summarizes the Company s goodwill activity by segment during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (in thousands): 

_______________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Included in   gain (loss) on disposition of real estate, net  , in the consolidated statement of operations. 
              (2) 
    Include  s   $51.5 million   of goodwill allocated to the cost basis of properties disposed of and classified as held for sale as discussed in   Note 5       Real Estate Investments   and   $2.3 million   of goodwill allocated to the cost basis of   two   properties foreclosed upon as discussed in   Note 10       Debt   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
       
  Intangible Assets 
  The intangible assets primarily consisted of management and advisory contracts that the Company has with certain Cole REITs, which are subject to an estimated useful life of approximately   four   years.  
  The Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company tests intangible assets for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. In the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the Company will adjust the intangible assets to their respective fair values and recognize an impairment loss.  
  The Company will estimate the fair value of the intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model specific to the applicable Cole REITs. The evaluation of intangible assets for potential impairment requires the Company s management to exercise significant judgment and to make certain assumptions. While the Company believes its assumptions are reasonable, there are no guarantees as to actual results. Changes in assumptions based on actual results may have a material impact on the Company s financial results. There were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that intangible assets were impaired during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015  .

Impairment of Real Estate Investments 
  The Company performs quarterly impairment review procedures, primarily through continuous monitoring of events and changes in circumstances that could indicate the carrying value of its real estate assets may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators that the Company considers include, but are not limited to, decrease in net operating income, bankruptcy or other credit concerns of a property s major tenant or tenants, such as history of late payments, rental concessions and other factors, as well as significant decreases in a property s revenues due to lease terminations, vacancies, co-tenancy clauses or reduced lease rates.  
  When impairment indicators are identified or if a property is considered to have a more likely than not probability of being disposed of within the next   12   to   24   months, the Company assesses the recoverability of the assets by determining whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. In the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the Company will adjust the real estate assets to their respective fair values and recognize an impairment loss. Generally, fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and recent comparable sales transactions.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , management identified certain properties for potential sale as part of its portfolio management strategy to reduce exposure to office properties. Additionally, a tenant of   59   restaurant properties filed for bankruptcy during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . As part of the Company s quarterly impairment review procedures and considering the factors mentioned above, real estate assets with carrying values totaling   $655.1 million   were deemed to be impaired and their carrying values were reduced to their estimated fair values of   $478.9 million   resulting in impairment charges of   $176.2 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , real estate assets with carrying values totaling   $319.3 million   were deemed to be impaired and their carrying values were reduced to their estimated fair values of   $234.0 million  , resulting in impairment charges of   $85.3 million  .  
  Consolidated Joint Ventures  
  The Company had interests in   two   joint ventures that owned   two   properties as of each of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (the  Consolidated Joint Ventures ). As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Consolidated Joint Ventures had total assets of   $59.6 million   and   $58.5 million  , of which   $55.6 million   and   $55.2 million  , respectively, were real estate investments, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.   One   property secured a mortgage note payable of   $9.9 million  , which was non-recourse to the Company. The Company has the ability to control operating and financial policies of the Consolidated Joint Ventures. There are restrictions on the use of these assets as the Company would generally be required to obtain the approval of each partner (the  Partner ) in accordance with the joint venture agreement for any major transactions. The Company and each Partner are subject to the provisions of each joint venture agreement, which includes provisions for when additional contributions may be required to fund certain cash shortfalls. The Partners  share of the Consolidated Joint Ventures  income was   $12,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and the Partners  share of the Consolidated Joint Ventures  loss was   $23,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Partners  share of the Consolidated Joint Ventures  income or loss is included in net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated statements of operations.  
  The Partners  share of income from   four   consolidated joint ventures was   $0.4 million   and   $1.2 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, and is included in net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company disposed of its interest in   two   of these consolidated joint ventures on or after June 30, 2015.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  
  The Company s investment in unconsolidated joint ventures consisted of interests in   two   joint ventures that owned   two   properties, which were comprised of   0.5 million   square feet of retail space as of   September 30, 2016  , and interests in   three   joint ventures that owned   three   properties, which were comprised of   0.9 million   square feet of retail and office space as of   December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company owned aggregate equity investments of   $18.6 million   and   $52.8 million  , respectively, in unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting as the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of these investments. The equity method of accounting requires the investment to be initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Company s share of equity in earnings and distributions from the joint ventures. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s maximum exposure to risk was   $18.6 million  , the carrying value of the investments, which is presented in investment in unconsolidated entities in the consolidated balance sheet. The unconsolidated joint ventures had total debt outstanding of   $46.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   none   of which is recourse to the Company, as discussed in   Note 10       Debt  . The Company and the respective unconsolidated joint venture partners are subject to the provisions of the applicable joint venture agreement, which includes provisions for when additional contributions may be required to fund certain cash shortfalls. 
  The Company records its proportionate share of net income (loss) from the unconsolidated joint ventures in the equity in income and gain on disposition of unconsolidated entities in the consolidated statements of operations. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   $0.2 million   and   $0.6 million   of net income, respectively,  from the unconsolidated joint ventures which owned   two   and   three   properties, respectively. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized   $0.1 million   and   $1.5 million   of net income, respectively, from unconsolidated joint ventures which owned   six   properties. 
  The following is a summary of the Company s percentage ownership and carrying amount related to each of the unconsolidated joint ventures as of   September 30, 2016   (dollar amounts in thousands):

_______________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    The Company s ownership interest in this table reflects its legal ownership interest. Legal ownership may, at times, not equal the Company s economic interest in the listed properties because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. As a result, the Company s actual economic interest (as distinct from its legal ownership interest) in certain of the properties could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with its legal ownership interests. 
              (2) 
    The total carrying amount of the investments is greater than the underlying equity in net assets by   $6.5 million  . This difference relates to a purchase price allocation of goodwill and a step up in fair value of the investment assets acquired in connection with the Cole Merger. The step up in fair value was allocated to the individual investment assets and is being amortized in accordance with the Company s depreciation policy. 
      
  Note 6       Investment Securities, at Fair Value    
  Investment securities are considered available-for-sale and, therefore, increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of equity in the consolidated balance sheets unless the securities are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired at which time the losses are reclassified to expense.

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company owned   eight   and   ten   CMBS, respectively, with an estimated aggregate fair value of   $48.1 million   and   $53.3 million  , respectively. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   two   CMBS with a combined carrying value of less than   $0.1 million   at December 31, 2015, were paid in full. The Company generally receives monthly payments of principal and interest on the CMBS. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company earned interest on the CMBS at rates ranging between   5.88%   and   8.95%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of   six   CMBS were below their amortized cost. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers a variety of factors, including: (i) whether the Company has the intent to sell the impaired security, (ii) whether the Company expects to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value, and (iii) whether the company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company believes that none of the unrealized losses on investment securities are other-than-temporary as management expects the Company will fully recover the entire amortized cost basis of all securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   other-than-temporary impairment losses. 
  The scheduled maturity of the Company s CMBS as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows (in thousands): 

Note 7     Mortgage Notes Receivable 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   nine   mortgage notes receivable with a weighted-average interest rate of   6.3%   and weighted-average years to maturity of   13.2   years. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   one   note with a carrying value of   $0.4 million   at December 31, 2015, reached maturity and was paid in full. The following table details the mortgage notes receivable as of   September 30, 2016   (dollar amounts in thousands):  

The Company s mortgage notes receivable are comprised primarily of fully-amortizing or nearly fully-amortizing first mortgage loans. The Company has   one   mortgage note receivable where the Company does not receive monthly payments of principal and interest but rather the interest is capitalized into the outstanding balance that is due at maturity. The mortgage notes receivable are primarily on commercial real estate, each leased to a single tenant. Therefore, the Company s monitoring of the credit quality of its mortgage notes receivable is focused primarily on an analysis of the tenant, including review of tenant quality and ratings, trends in the tenant s industry and general economic conditions and an analysis of measures of collateral coverage, such as an estimate of the loan-to-value ratio (principal amount outstanding divided by the estimated value of the property) and its remaining term until maturity.  
  The following table summarizes the scheduled aggregate principal payments due to the Company on the mortgage notes receivable subsequent to   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):

  Note 9     Fair Value Measures 
  The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment. U.S. GAAP guidance defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
  Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
  Level 2   Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability. 
  Level 3   Unobservable inputs reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques. 
  The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. Changes in the type of inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The Company expects that changes in classifications between levels will be infrequent.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, based on market rates of the Company s positions and other observable interest rates as discussed in   Note 6       Investment Securities, at Fair Value   and     Note 11       Derivatives and Hedging Activities  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those instruments fall (in thousands): 

CMBS     The Company s CMBS are carried at fair value and are valued using Level 3 inputs. The Company used estimated non-binding quoted market prices from the trading desks of financial institutions that are dealers in such securities for similar CMBS tranches that actively participate in the CMBS market. Broker quotes are only indicative of fair value and may not necessarily represent what the Company would receive in an actual trade for the applicable instrument. Management determines that the prices are representative of fair value through its knowledge of and experience in the market. The significant unobservable input used in valuing the CMBS is the discount rate or market yield used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate or market yield would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value measurement. The following risks are included in the consideration and selection of discount rates or market yields: risk of default, rating of the investment and comparable company investments. 
  Derivative Assets and Liabilities         The Company s derivative financial instruments relate to interest rate swaps, discussed in   Note 11       Derivatives and Hedging Activities  . The valuation of derivative instruments is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, as well as observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. In addition, credit valuation adjustments are incorporated into the fair values to account for the Company s potential nonperformance risk and the performance risk of the counterparties.  
  Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with those derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. However, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of the Company s derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
  The fair value of short-term financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, due to affiliates and accounts payable approximate their carrying value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets due to their short-term nature and are classified as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis  
  Certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment.  
  Real Estate Assets 
  As discussed in   Note 5       Real Estate Investments  , during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , real estate assets related to   139   properties were deemed to be impaired and their carrying values were reduced to their estimated fair value of   $478.9 million  , resulting in impairment charges of   $176.2 million  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   $85.3 million   of impairment charges were recorded. The Company estimates fair values using Level 3 inputs and using a combined income and market approach, specifically using discounted cash flow analysis and recent comparable sales transactions. The evaluation of real estate assets for potential impairment requires the Company s management to exercise significant judgment and to make certain key assumptions, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) capitalization rate; (2) discount rates; (3) number of years property will be held; (4) property operating expenses; and (5) re-leasing assumptions including number of months to re-lease, market rental income and required tenant improvements. There are inherent uncertainties in making these estimates such as market conditions and performance and sustainability of the Company s tenants. For our impairment tests for the real estate assets during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we used a range of discount rates from of   6.7%   to   9.0%   with a weighted-average rate of   8.0%   and capitalization rates from   7.0%   to   12.5%   with a weighted-average rate of   7.9%  . 
  The following table presents the impairment charges by asset class recorded during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   (dollar amounts in thousands):

Additionally, a   $55.0 million   note was assumed by the buyer in a real estate disposition resulting in a write-off of the unamortized premium of   $1.1 million   and the unamortized deferred financing costs of   $0.3 million  , which are included in   gain (loss) on disposition of real estate, net  .  
              (2) 
    Net premiums on mortgage notes payable and other debt were recorded upon the assumption of the respective debt instruments in relation to the various mergers and acquisitions. Amortization of these net premiums is recorded as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective debt instruments using the effective-interest method.  
              (3) 
    Discounts on the corporate bonds and convertible debt were recorded based upon the fair value of the respective debt instruments as of the respective issuance dates.

    Includes   $242.4 million   of variable-rate debt fixed by way of interest rate swap arrangements.  
              (4) 
    The table above does not include loan amounts associated with the unconsolidated joint ventures of   $46.2 million  ,   none   of which is recourse to the Company. These loans represent secured fixed and variable rates ranging from   2.93%   to   5.20%   and maturities ranging from   October 2016   to   July 2021  , with a weighted-average interest rate of   3.93%   and a weighted-average years to maturity of   2.1   years as of   September 30, 2016  .  
     The Company s mortgage loan agreements generally restrict corporate guarantees and require the maintenance of financial covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios). The mortgage loan agreements contain no dividend restrictions except in the event of default or when a distribution would drive liquidity below the applicable thresholds. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company believes it was in compliance with the debt covenants under the mortgage loan agreements and had no restrictions on the payment of dividends.  
  On January 13, 2015, a substantially vacant office building in Bethesda, Maryland was foreclosed upon after the Company elected to stop making debt service payments on the related non-recourse loan with an outstanding balance of   $53.8 million   as of December 31, 2014. As a result of the foreclosure, the Company forfeited its right to the property and was relieved of all obligations on the non-recourse loan. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded a gain on the forgiveness of debt of   $4.9 million  , which is included in   (loss) gain on extinguishment and forgiveness of debt, net   in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  
  On March 6, 2015, the Company received a notice of default from the lender of a non-recourse loan secured by   two   properties, which had an outstanding balance of   $38.1 million   on the notice date, due to the Company s election not to make a reserve payment required per the loan agreement. The foreclosure sale of the first property securing the loan occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016. As the loan was outstanding upon the foreclosure of the first property, the Company recorded a loss of   $3.4 million   in   gain (loss) on disposition of real estate, net   in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The foreclosure proceedings on the second property that secured the loan were completed during the three months ended September 30, 2016. As a result of the foreclosure sale and deed transfer of both properties securing the loan, the Company recognized a gain on forgiveness of debt of   $19.1 million  , which is included in   (loss) gain on extinguishment and forgiveness of debt, net   in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

     The 2018 Convertible Notes may be converted into cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination thereof in limited circumstances prior to February 1, 2018 and may be converted into such consideration at any time on or after February 1, 2018. The 2020 Convertible Notes may be converted into cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination thereof, in limited circumstances prior to June 15, 2020, and may be converted into such consideration at any time on or after June 15, 2020. There were no changes to the terms of the Convertible Notes and the Company believes it was in compliance with the covenants pursuant to the indenture governing the Convertible Notes as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Credit Facility 
  The General Partner, as guarantor, and the OP, as borrower, are parties to an unsecured credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) pursuant to a credit agreement, dated as of June 30, 2014, as amended, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo ), as administrative agent and other lenders party thereto (the  Credit Agreement ). 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Credit Facility allowed for maximum borrowings of   $2.8 billion  , consisting of a   $0.5 billion   term loan facility (the  Credit Facility Term Loan ) and a   $2.3 billion   revolving credit facility. The maximum aggregate dollar amount of letters of credit that may be outstanding at any one time under the Credit Facility is   $25.0 million  . During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company repaid all of the outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Additionally, the Company repaid   $0.5 billion   of the Credit Facility Term Loan, resulting in the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of   $4.3 million  , which is included in   (loss) gain on extinguishment and forgiveness of debt, net   in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As discussed in   Note 11       Derivatives and Hedging Activities  , in connection with the early repayment of a portion of the Credit Facility Term Loan, the Company terminated   two   of its interest rate swaps, resulting in the reclassification of   $3.3 million   in other comprehensive income to earnings, which is included in   loss on derivative instruments, net   in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The remaining outstanding balance on the Credit Facility Term Loan of   $0.5 billion   is, in effect, fixed through the use of derivative instruments used to hedge interest rate volatility. Including the spread, which can vary based on the General Partner s credit rating, the interest rate on this portion was   3.25%   at   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , a maximum of   $2.3 billion   was available to the OP for future borrowings, subject to borrowing availability.  
  The revolving credit facility generally bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus   1.00%   to   1.80%   or Base Rate plus   0.00%   to   0.80%   (based upon the General Partner s then current credit rating).  Base Rate  is defined as the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus   0.50%   or a floating rate based on one month LIBOR, determined on a daily basis. The Credit Facility Term Loan generally bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus   1.15%   to   2.05%  , or Base Rate plus   0.15%   to   1.05%   (based upon the General Partner s then current credit rating). In addition, the Credit Agreement provides the flexibility for interest rate auctions, pursuant to which, at the Company s election, the Company may request that lenders make competitive bids to provide revolving loans, which competitive bids may be at pricing levels that differ from the foregoing interest rates.

The Credit Agreement provides for monthly interest payments under the Credit Facility. In the event of default, at the election of a majority of the lenders (or automatically upon a bankruptcy event of default with respect to the OP or the General Partner), the commitments of the lenders under the Credit Facility will mature, and payment of any unpaid amounts in respect of the Credit Facility will be accelerated. The revolving credit facility and the Credit Facility Term Loan both terminate on   June 30, 2018  , in each case, unless extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a   one  -year extension option with respect to each of the revolving credit facility and the Credit Facility Term Loan, exercisable at the Company s election and subject to certain customary conditions, as well as certain customary  amend and extend  provisions. At any time, upon timely notice by the OP and subject to any breakage fees, the OP may prepay borrowings under the Credit Facility (subject to certain limitations applicable to the prepayment of any loans obtained through an interest rate auction, as described above). The OP incurs a fee equal to   0.15%   to   0.25%   per annum (based upon the General Partner s then current credit rating) multiplied by the commitments (whether or not utilized) in respect of the revolving credit facility. In addition, the OP incurs customary administrative agent, letter of credit issuance, letter of credit fronting, extension and other fees. 
  The Credit Facility requires restrictions on corporate guarantees, as well as the maintenance of financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios) and the maintenance of a minimum net worth. The key financial covenants in the Credit Facility, as defined and calculated per the terms of the Credit Agreement, include maintaining (i) a maximum leverage ratio less than or equal to   60%  , (ii) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least   1.5  x, (iii) a secured leverage ratio less than or equal to   45%  , (iv) a total unencumbered asset value ratio less than or equal to   60%  , (v) a minimum tangible net worth covenant of at least   $5.5 billion  , (vi) a minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio of at least   1.75  x and (vii) a minimum unencumbered asset value of at least   $8.0 billion   (up to   35%   of which may be comprised of restaurant properties from June 30, 2016 to December 30, 2016 and up to   30%   of which may be comprised of restaurant properties from December 31, 2016 on). The Company believes it was in compliance with the Credit Agreement and is not restricted from accessing any borrowing availability under the Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  2016 Term Loan 
  On June 2, 2016, the General Partner as guarantor, and the OP, as borrower, entered into a   $300.0 million   senior secured term loan facility (the  2016 Term Loan ), pursuant to a credit agreement (the  2016 Term Loan Agreement ) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent, and certain other lenders party thereto. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company borrowed   $300.0 million   on the 2016 Term Loan and subsequently repaid the balance prior to   September 30, 2016  . In connection with the prepayment, the Company wrote-off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs resulting in a loss of   $2.6 million   which is included in   (loss) gain on extinguishment and forgiveness of debt, net   in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
   
  Note 11       Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
  Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 
  The Company may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, options, floors and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings. The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with the Company s operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions. The Company does not intend to utilize derivatives for purposes other than interest rate risk management. The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are not able to perform under the agreements. To mitigate this risk, the Company only enters into derivative financial instruments with counterparties with high credit ratings and with major financial institutions with which the Company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships. The Company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations. 
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable-rate debt. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company reclassified   $1.2 million   and   $5.1 million  , respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest expense as a result of the hedged forecasted transactions affecting earnings. 
  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives designated that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized directly in earnings. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a   gain   of   $1.0 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively, in earnings related to the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives designated that qualify as cash flow hedges. 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company terminated   two   of its interest rate swaps in connection with the early repayment of a portion of the Credit Facility Term Loan, as discussed in   Note 10       Debt  , and accelerated the reclassification of a portion of the amounts in other comprehensive income to earnings as a result of a portion of the hedged forecasted transactions becoming probable not to occur. A   loss   of   $3.3 million   was recorded in relation to the acceleration, which is included in   loss on derivative instruments, net   in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
  Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that an additional   $2.3 million   will be reclassified from other comprehensive income as an increase to interest expense.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk (dollar amounts in thousands): 

The table below presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification in the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

In January 2014, the Company entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a notional amount of   $250.0 million   (the  Treasury Lock Agreement ). The Treasury Lock Agreement, which had an original maturity date of February 12, 2014, was entered into to hedge part of the Company s interest rate exposure associated with the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the   10  -year U.S. treasury rates related to the planned issuance of debt securities in conjunction with the merger of Cole Capital with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Company s offering of Senior Notes in February 2014, the Company settled the Treasury Lock Agreement for   $3.9 million  , which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge, recorded to other comprehensive loss and will be amortized into earnings over the   10  -year term of the Treasury Lock. The Company recognized   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million   of interest expense for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, related to the Treasury Lock Agreement. 
  Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
  Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company s exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the requirements to be classified as hedging instruments. A gain of   $0.3 million   and a loss of   $1.1 million   related to the change in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments was recorded in   loss on derivative instruments, net   in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company recorded a loss of   $0.9 million   and   $1.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.

  Government Investigations and Litigation Relating to the Audit Committee Investigation 
  As previously reported, on October 29, 2014, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the  October 29 8-K ) reporting the Audit Committee s conclusion, based on the preliminary findings of its investigation, that certain previously issued consolidated financial statements of the Company, including those included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014, and related financial information should no longer be relied upon. The Company also reported that the Audit Committee had based its conclusion on the preliminary findings of its investigation into concerns regarding accounting practices and other matters that were first reported to the Audit Committee in early September 2014 and that the Audit Committee believed that an error in the calculation of adjusted funds from operations for the first quarter of 2014 had been identified but intentionally not corrected when the Company reported its financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014. Prior to the filing of the October 29 8-K, the Audit Committee previewed for the SEC the information contained in the filing. Subsequent to that filing, the SEC provided notice that it had commenced a formal investigation and issued subpoenas calling for the production of various documents. In addition, the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York contacted counsel for the Audit Committee and counsel for the Company with respect to this matter, and the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts issued a subpoena calling for the production of various documents. The Audit Committee and the Company have been cooperating with these regulators in their investigations.

In connection with these investigations, on September 8, 2016, the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York announced the filing of criminal charges against the Company s former Chief Financial Officer and former Chief Accounting Officer (the  Criminal Action ), as well as the fact that the former Chief Accounting Officer has pleaded guilty to the charges filed. That same day, the SEC announced the filing of a civil complaint against the same   two   individuals in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the  SEC Civil Action ). On October 12, 2016, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York filed a motion to intervene in and stay the SEC Civil Action until the conclusion of the Criminal Action. On November 1, 2016, the Court granted the motion to stay with respect to all witness related discovery.

On September 1, 2016, the Company filed a motion to stay the Witchko Action. On September 8, 2016, the court issued an order denying the Company s motion. Document production in the Witchko Action is being coordinated with production in the SDNY Consolidated Securities Class Action. 
  On December 3, 2015, the Company was named as a nominal defendant and certain of its former officers and directors were named as defendants in a shareholder derivative action filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in Maryland, captioned Frampton v. Schorsch, et al., No. 24-C-15-006269 (the  Frampton Action ). The Frampton Action seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of the Company for, among other things, alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and contribution and indemnification. The Company filed a motion to stay the Frampton Action on March 7, 2016. That motion is fully briefed and pending before the court and a conference is scheduled on November 3, 2016. 
  On June 10, 2016, the Company was named as a nominal defendant, and certain of its former officers and directors, among others, were named as defendants, in a shareholder derivative action filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, captioned Kosky v. Schorsch, et al., No. 653093/2016 (the  Kosky Action ). The Kosky Action seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of the Company for, among other things, alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, negligence, and breach of contract. On October 6, 2016, the parties filed a stipulation staying the Kosky Action until final resolution of the SDNY Consolidated Securities Class Action. 
  On October 6, 2016, the Company was named as a nominal defendant, and certain of its former officers and directors, among others, were named as defendants, in a shareholder derivative action filed in United States District Court for the District of Maryland, captioned Meloche v. Schorsch, et al., 16-cv-03366 (the  Meloche Action ). The Meloche Action seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of the Company for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and negligence. The Company is required to respond to the complaint by January 13, 2017. 
  The Company has not reserved amounts for any of the litigation or investigation matters above either because it has not concluded that a loss is probable in the matter or because it believes that any probable loss or reasonably possible range of loss is not reasonably estimable at this time. The Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss because these matters involve significant uncertainties, including the complexity of the facts and the legal theory and the nature of the claims. 
  CapLease Litigation Matters 
  Following the announcement of the merger agreement with CapLease in May 2013, a number of lawsuits were filed by CapLease stockholders, the following of which remain pending: 
  On June 25, 2013, a putative class action and derivative lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against the Company, the OP, CapLease, and members of the CapLease board of directors, among others, captioned Tarver v. CapLease, Inc., et al., No. 24-C-13-004176 (the  Tarver Action ). The complaint alleged, among other things, that the merger agreement was the product of breaches of fiduciary duty by the CapLease directors because the transaction purportedly did not provide for full and fair value for the CapLease shareholders and was not the result of a competitive bidding process, the merger agreement allegedly contained coercive deal protection measures and the merger was purportedly approved as a result of improper self-dealing by certain defendants who would receive certain alleged employment compensation benefits and continued employment pursuant to the merger agreement. In August 2013, counsel in the Tarver Action filed a motion for a stay in the Baltimore Court, informing the court that the plaintiff had agreed to join and participate in the prosecution of other actions concerning the CapLease transaction then pending in a New York court (which were subsequently dismissed). The stay was granted by the Baltimore Court and the parties have engaged in no subsequent activity in the Tarver Action. 
  In October 2013, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against the Company, the OP, CapLease, and members of the CapLease board of directors, among others, captioned Poling v. CapLease, Inc., et al., No. 24-C-13-006178 (the  Poling Action ). The complaint alleged that the merger agreement breached the terms of the CapLease   8.375%   Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series B ) and the terms of the   7.25%   Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series C ) and was in violation of the Series B Articles Supplementary and the Series C Articles Supplementary. The complaint alleged claims for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.

In December 2013, all Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Poling Action, which was granted by the court in May 2015. Plaintiff appealed the decision to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, which affirmed the trial court s order on May 3, 2016.  A petition seeking further appellate review was subsequently denied by the Maryland Court of Appeals on August 22, 2016. 
  Cole Litigation Matter 
  In December 2013, Realistic Partners filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and the then-members of its board of directors in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, captioned Realistic Partners v. American Realty Capital Partners, et al., No. 654468/2013. Cole was later added as a defendant. The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the board of the Company breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the transactions contemplated under the Cole Merger Agreement (in connection with the merger between a wholly owned subsidiary of Cole and Cole Holdings Corporation) and that Cole aided and abetted those breaches. In January 2014, the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding settlement of all claims asserted on behalf of the alleged class of the Company s stockholders. The proposed settlement terms required the Company to make certain additional disclosures related to the Cole Merger, which were included in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on January 17, 2014. The memorandum of understanding also contemplated that the parties would enter into a stipulation of settlement, which would be subject to customary conditions, including confirmatory discovery and court approval following notice to the Company s stockholders, and provided that the defendants would not object to a payment of up to   $625,000   for attorneys  fees. If the parties enter into a stipulation of settlement, which has not occurred, a hearing will be scheduled at which the court will consider the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the settlement. There can be no assurance that the parties will ultimately enter into a stipulation of settlement, that the court will approve any proposed settlement, or that any eventual settlement will be under the same terms as those contemplated by the memorandum of understanding.

Purchase Commitments 
  Cole Capital enters into purchase and sale agreements and deposits funds into escrow towards the purchase of real estate assets, most of which are expected to be assigned to   one   of the Cole REITs at or prior to the closing of the respective acquisition. As of   September 30, 2016  , Cole Capital was a party to   nine   purchase and sale agreements with unaffiliated third-party sellers to purchase a   100%   interest in   13   properties, subject to meeting certain criteria, for an aggregate purchase price of   $290.0 million  , exclusive of closing costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , Cole Capital had   $3.1 million   of property escrow deposits held by escrow agents in connection with these future property acquisitions, which may be forfeited if the transactions are not completed under certain circumstances. Cole Capital will be reimbursed by the assigned Cole REIT for amounts escrowed when the property is assigned to the respective Cole REIT.  
  Environmental Matters 
  In connection with the ownership and operation of real estate, the Company may potentially be liable for costs and damages related to environmental matters. The Company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any non-compliance, liability or other claim, and is not aware of any other environmental condition, in each case, that it believes will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations.

  Preferred Stock and Preferred OP Units 
  Series F Preferred Stock 
  On January 3, 2014, in connection with the merger of American Realty Capital Trust IV, Inc. with and into a subsidiary of the OP (the  ARCT IV Merger ),   42.2 million   shares of Series F Preferred Stock were issued by the Company, resulting in the Operating Partnership concurrently issuing   42.2 million   General Partner Series F preferred units ( General Partner Series F Preferred Units ) to the General Partner, and   700,000   Series F Preferred Units ( Limited Partner Series F Preferred Units ) to holders of each outstanding unit of American Realty Capital Operating Partnership IV, L.P.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has received redemption requests totaling approximately   13.1 million   Limited Partner OP Units from certain affiliates of the Former Manager, which would have been redeemable for a corresponding number of common shares. The Company believes it has potential claims against recipients of those OP Units and has engaged in discussions with affiliates of the Former Manager regarding the redemption requests. Pending any resolution, the Company does not currently intend to satisfy any of the redemption requests. In light of the potential claims, since October 15, 2015, the OP has not paid distributions in respect of a substantial portion of the outstanding Limited Partner OP Units when the Common Stock dividends were otherwise paid.  
  Common Stock Dividends  
  On August 1, 2016, the Company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.1375   per share of common stock (equaling an annualized dividend rate of   $0.55   per share) for the third quarter of 2016 to stockholders of record as of September 30, 2016, which was paid on October 17, 2016. An equivalent distribution by the Operating Partnership is applicable per OP unit. 
  Common Stock Repurchases 
  Under the General Partner s Equity Plan (defined below), individuals have the option to have the General Partner repurchase shares vesting from awards made under the Equity Plan in order to satisfy the minimum federal and state tax withholding obligations. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the General Partner repurchased   424,726   shares to satisfy the federal and state tax withholding on behalf of employees.  
   
  Note 16     Equity-based Compensation 
  Equity Plan 
  The General Partner has adopted an equity plan (the  Equity Plan ), which provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares of Common Stock ( Restricted Shares ), restricted stock units ( Restricted Stock Units ), dividend equivalent rights and other stock-based awards to the General Partner s and its affiliates  non-executive directors, officers and other employees and advisors or consultants who are providing services to the General Partner or its affiliates. To date, the General Partner has granted fully vested shares of Common Stock, Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units (defined below) under the Equity Plan. Restricted Shares provide for rights identical to those of Common Stock. Restricted Stock Units do not provide for any rights of a common stockholder prior to the vesting of such Restricted Stock Units. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, Restricted Shares are considered issued and outstanding. As is the case when fully vested shares of Common Stock are issued from the Equity Plan, for each Restricted Share awarded under the Equity Plan, the Operating Partnership issues a General Partner OP Unit to the General Partner with identical terms. Upon vesting of Restricted Stock Units, the Operating Partnership issues a General Partner OP Unit to the General Partner for each share of Common Stock issued as a result of such vesting. 
  The General Partner has authorized and reserved a total number of shares equal to   10.0%   of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (on a fully diluted basis assuming the redemption of all OP Units for shares of Common Stock) to be issued at any time under the Equity Plan for equity incentive awards. As of   September 30, 2016  , the General Partner had cumulatively awarded under its Equity Plan approximately   4.1 million   Restricted Shares, net of the forfeiture of   3.6 million   Restricted Shares through that date,   3.4 million   Restricted Stock Units, net of the forfeiture of   0.5 million   Restricted Stock Units through that date, and   0.2 million   Deferred Stock Units, collectively representing approximately   7.7 million   shares of Common Stock. Accordingly, as of such date, approximately   92.1 million   additional shares were available for future issuance.

Restricted Shares 
  The Company has issued Restricted Shares to certain employees and non-executive directors beginning in 2011. In addition, the Company issued Restricted Shares to employees of affiliates of the Former Manager prior to 2015. The fair value of the Restricted Shares granted to employees under the Equity Plan is generally determined using the closing stock price on the grant date and is expensed over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. The fair value of Restricted Shares granted to non-executive directors and employees of affiliates of the Former Manager under the Equity Plan was measured based upon the fair value of goods or services received or the equity instruments granted, whichever was more reliably determinable, and was expensed in full at the date of grant.  
  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $0.4 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively, of compensation expense related to the Restricted Shares, which is recorded in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  
  The following table details the activity of the Restricted Shares during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

Time-Based Restricted Stock Units 
  Under the Equity Plan, the Company may award Restricted Stock Units to employees that will vest if the recipient maintains his/her employment over the requisite service period (the  Time-Based Restricted Stock Units ). The fair value of the Time-Based Restricted Stock Units granted to employees under the Equity Plan is generally determined using the closing stock price on the grant date and is expensed over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis, which is generally   three   years. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $0.9 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively, of compensation expense related to the Time-Based Restricted Stock Units, which is recorded in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  
  Deferred Stock Units 
  The Company may award Deferred Stock Units to non-executive directors under the Equity Plan (the  Deferred Stock Units ). Each Deferred Stock Unit represents the right to receive   one   share of Common Stock. The Deferred Stock Units provide for immediate vesting on the grant date and will be settled with Common Stock either on the earlier of the date on which the respective director separates from the Company or the third anniversary of the grant date, or if granted pursuant to the director s voluntary election to participate in the director s deferred compensation program, on the date the director separates from the Company. The fair value of the Deferred Stock Units is determined using the closing stock price on the grant date and is expensed over the requisite service period or on the grant date for awards with no requisite service period. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $34,000   and   $0.7 million   of expense related to Deferred Stock Units, which is recorded in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Market-Based Restricted Stock Units 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the General Partner awarded Restricted Stock Units to certain employees under the Equity Plan that were contingent upon the Common Stock reaching a certain market price (the  Market-Based Restricted Stock Units ). The Market-Based Restricted Stock Units were contingent upon the closing price of the Common Stock equaling or exceeding   $10   per share for   20   consecutive trading days (the  Market Condition ) and the grantee s continued employment as of such date on which the Market Condition was met. On July 28, 2016,   610,839   Market-Based Restricted Stock Units vested, of which   199,858   shares were withheld to cover grantees  tax withholding obligations, resulting in   410,981   shares being issued.  
  The fair value and derived service period of the Market-Based Restricted Stock Units as of their grant date was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation, which took into account multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the Market Condition. The method required the input of assumptions, including the future dividend yield and expected volatility of the Common Stock. Compensation expense was recognized on a straight-line basis over the derived service period regardless of whether the Market Condition was satisfied, provided that the requisite service condition had been achieved. The Market-Based Restricted Stock Units were fully expensed during the year ended December 31, 2015, however the Company recorded contra-expense due to the forfeiture of such awards. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded contra-expense of   $0.1 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively, related to forfeitures of the Market-Based Restricted Stock Units which is recorded in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  
  Long-Term Incentive Awards 
  The General Partner may award long-term incentive-based Restricted Stock Units (the  LTI Target Awards ) to employees under the Equity Plan. Vesting of the LTI Target Awards is based upon the General Partner s level of achievement of total stockholder return ( TSR ), including both share price appreciation and Common Stock dividends, as measured equally against a market index and against a peer group generally over a three year period. 
  The fair value and derived service period of the LTI Target Awards as of their grant date is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation which takes into account multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the required TSR, as outlined in the award agreements. This method requires the input of assumptions, including the future dividend yield, the expected volatility of the Common Stock and the expected volatility of the market index constituents and the peer group. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the derived service period regardless of whether the necessary TSR is attained, provided that the requisite service condition has been achieved. During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $1.3 million   and   $3.3 million  , respectively, of expense related to the LTI Target Awards, which is recorded in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  
  The following table details the activity of the unvested Market-Based Restricted Stock Units and the LTI Target Awards during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

Offering-Related Revenue 
  The Company generally receives a selling commission, dealer manager fee and/or a distribution and stockholder servicing fee based on the gross offering proceeds related to the sale of shares of the Cole REITs  common stock in their primary offerings. The Company has reallowed   100%   of selling commissions earned to participating broker-dealers. The Company, in its sole discretion, may reallow all or a portion of its dealer manager fee to such participating broker-dealers as a marketing and due diligence expense reimbursement, based on factors such as the volume of shares issued by such participating broker-dealers and the amount of marketing support provided by such participating broker-dealers. No selling commissions or dealer manager fees are paid to the Company or other broker-dealers with respect to shares issued under the respective Cole REIT s distribution reinvestment plan, under which the stockholders may elect to have distributions reinvested in additional shares. 
  All other organization and offering expenses associated with the sale of the Cole REITs  common stock are paid for in advance by the Company and subject to reimbursement by the Cole REITs, up to certain limits in accordance with their respective advisory agreements and charters. As these costs are incurred, they are recorded as reimbursement revenue, up to the respective limit, and are included in offering-related revenues in the financial results for Cole Capital. Expenses paid on behalf of the Cole REITs in excess of these limits that are expected to be collected based on future estimated offering proceeds are recorded as program development costs, which are included in rent and tenant receivables and other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company assesses the collectability of the program development costs, considering the offering period and historical and forecasted sales of shares under the Cole REITs  respective offerings and reserves for any balances considered not collectible. Additional reserves are generally recorded if actual proceeds raised from the offerings and corresponding program development costs incurred differ from management s assumptions. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had organization and offering costs recorded as program development costs, included in rent and tenant receivables and other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets, of   $12.3 million   and   $12.9 million  , respectively, which were net of reserves of   $18.8 million   and   $34.8 million  , respectively.

The table below presents certain information related to the Company s investments in the Cole REITs as of   September 30, 2016   (carrying amount in thousands): 

Due to Affiliates 
  Due to affiliates, as reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, was   $0.2 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , related to amounts due to the Cole REITs for expense reimbursements. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   no   such balance due to affiliates.  
  Due from Affiliates  
  As of each of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $10.6 million   was expected to be collected from affiliates, excluding balances from the Cole REITs  lines of credit, discussed below, related to services provided by the Company and expenses subject to reimbursement by the Cole REITs in accordance with their respective advisory and property management agreements.  
  On September 23, 2016, the Company entered into a   $30.0 million   revolving line of credit (the  Subordinate Promissory Note ) with Cole Corporate Income Operating Partnership III, LP ( CCI III OP ), the operating partnership of CCIT III (the  Subordinate Promissory Note Agreement ) . The Subordinate Promissory Note bears variable interest rates of one-month LIBOR plus the Credit Facility Margin (as defined in the Subordinate Promissory Note Agreement), which ranges from   2.20%   to   2.75%  , plus   1.75%   and matures on September 22, 2017. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Subordinate Promissory Note had an interest rate of   5.05%   and   $10.3 million   was outstanding. 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had revolving line of credit agreements in place with CCIT II and CCPT V (the  Affiliate Lines of Credit ) that provided for maximum borrowings of   $60.0 million   to each of CCIT II and CCPT V and bore variable interest rates of one-month LIBOR plus   2.20%  . As of   December 31, 2015  , there was   $50.0 million   outstanding on the Affiliate Lines of Credit.

  Note 18       Net Income (Loss) Per Share/Unit  
  The General Partner s unvested Restricted Shares contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and are considered to be participating securities in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, therefore, are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class computation method. Under the two-class computation method, net losses are not allocated to participating securities unless the holder of the security has a contractual obligation to share in the losses. The unvested Restricted Shares are not allocated losses as the awards do not have a contractual obligation to share in losses of the General Partner. The two-class computation method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of shares of Common Stock and participating securities according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  . 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Certain risks may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a complete discussion of such risk factors, see the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meaning ascribed to those terms in the  Part I   Financial Information,  including the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained therein. 
   
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes  forward-looking statements  (within the meaning of the federal securities laws, Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) that reflect our expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. We have attempted to identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as  may,   will,   seek,   expects,   anticipates,   believes,   targets,   intends,   should,   estimates,   could,   continue,   assume,   projects,   plans  or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things, those discussed below. We intend for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as applicable by law. We do not undertake publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying assumptions or new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required to satisfy our obligations under federal securities law.  
  The following are some, but not all, of the assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:  
             
    We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all. 
                
    We are subject to risks associated with tenant, geographic and industry concentrations with respect to our properties. 
                
    Our properties, goodwill and intangible assets and other assets may be subject to impairment charges. 
                
    We could be subject to unexpected costs or unexpected liabilities that may arise from potential dispositions and may be unable to dispose of properties on advantageous terms. 
                
    We are subject to competition in the acquisition and disposition of properties and in the leasing of our properties and we may be unable to acquire, dispose of, or lease properties on advantageous terms. 
                
    We could be subject to risks associated with bankruptcies or insolvencies of tenants or from tenant defaults generally. 
                
    We may be affected by risks associated with pending government investigations relating to the findings of the Audit Committee Investigation and related litigation. 
                
    We have substantial indebtedness, which may affect our ability to pay dividends, and expose us to interest rate fluctuation risk and the risk of default under our debt obligations. 
                
    Our overall borrowing and operating flexibility may be adversely affected by the terms and restrictions within the indenture governing the Senior Notes, and the terms of the Credit Facility. 
                
    Our access to capital and terms of future financings may be affected by adverse changes to our credit rating.  
                
    We may be affected by the incurrence of additional secured or unsecured debt. 
                
    We may not be able to achieve and maintain profitability. 
                
    We may not generate cash flows sufficient to pay our dividends to stockholders or meet our debt service obligations.  
                
    We may be affected by risks resulting from losses in excess of insured limits.  
                
    We may fail to remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
                
    Compliance with the REIT annual distribution requirements may limit our operating flexibility. 
                
    We may be unable to fully reestablish the financial network which previously supported Cole Capital        and its Cole REITs and/or regain the prior level of transaction and capital raising volume of Cole Capital. 
                
    Our Cole Capital operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation. 
                
    We are subject to conflicts of interest relating to Cole Capital s investment management business. 
                
    We may be unable to retain or hire key personnel. 
     
   52    

     Table of Contents  

All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  We use certain defined terms throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have the following meanings: 
  When we refer to  annualized rental income,  we mean the rental revenue under our leases on operating properties owned at the respective reporting date on a straight-line basis, which includes the effect of rent escalations and any tenant concessions, such as free rent, and excludes any bad debt allowances and any contingent rent, such as percentage rent. Management uses annualized rental income as a basis for tenant, industry and geographic concentrations and other metrics within the portfolio. Annualized rental income is not indicative of future performance. 
  When we refer to a  creditworthy tenant,  we mean a tenant that has entered into a lease that we determine is creditworthy and may include tenants with an investment grade or below investment grade credit rating, as determined by major credit rating agencies, or unrated tenants. To the extent we determine that a tenant is a  creditworthy tenant  even though it does not have an investment grade credit rating, we do so based on our management s determination that a tenant should have the financial wherewithal to honor its obligations under its lease with us. As explained further below, this determination is based on our management s substantial experience performing credit analysis and is made after evaluating all of a tenant s due diligence materials that are made available to us, including financial statements and operating data. 
  When we refer to a  direct financing lease,  we mean a lease that requires specific treatment due to the significance of the lease payments from the inception of the lease compared to the fair value of the property, term of the lease, a transfer of ownership, or a bargain purchase option. These leases are recorded as a net asset on the balance sheet. The amount recorded is calculated as the fair value of the remaining lease payments on the leases and the estimated fair value of any expected residual property value at the end of the lease term.  
  When we refer to properties that are net leased on a  long term basis,  we mean properties with remaining primary lease terms of generally seven to 10 years or longer on average, depending on property type. 
  Under a  net lease,  the tenant occupying the leased property (usually as a single tenant) does so in much the same manner as if the tenant were the owner of the property. There are various forms of net leases, most typically classified as triple net or double net. Triple net leases typically require the tenant pay all expenses associated with the property (  e.g.  , real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs). Double net leases typically require that the tenant pay all operating expenses associated with the property (  e.g.  , real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance), but excludes some or all major repairs (  e.g.  , roof, structure and parking lot). Accordingly, the owner receives the rent  net  of these expenses, rendering the cash flow associated with the lease predictable for the term of the lease. Under a net lease, the tenant generally agrees to lease the property for a significant term and agrees that it will either have no ability or only limited ability to terminate the lease or abate rent prior to the expiration of the term of the lease as a result of real estate driven events such as casualty, condemnation or failure by the landlord to fulfill its obligations under the lease. 
   
  Overview  
  We are a full-service real estate operating company that operates through two business segments, our real estate investment segment, REI, and our investment management segment, Cole Capital, as further discussed in    Note 3       Segment Reporting    to our consolidated financial statements. Through our REI segment, we own and actively manage a diversified portfolio of   4,213   retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate properties with an aggregate of   96.9 million   square feet, of which   98.0%   was leased as of   September 30, 2016  , with a weighted-average remaining lease term of   10.0   years. Through our Cole Capital segment, we are responsible for raising capital for and managing the affairs of the Cole REITs on a day-to-day basis, identifying and making acquisitions and investments on behalf of the Cole REITs, and recommending to the respective board of directors of each of the Cole REITs an approach for providing investors with liquidity. Cole Capital receives compensation and reimbursement for performing these services. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Cole REITs and other real estate programs  assets under management were   $7.1 billion  . 
  We seek to lease space and/or acquire properties leased to creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting and operating guidelines. Prior to entering into any transaction, our corporate credit analysis and underwriting professionals conduct a review of a tenant s credit quality. In addition, we consistently monitor the credit quality of our portfolio by actively reviewing the creditworthiness of certain tenants, focusing primarily on those tenants representing the greatest concentration of our portfolio. This review primarily includes an analysis of the tenant s financial statements either quarterly, or as frequently as the lease permits. We also consider tenant credit quality when assessing our portfolio for strategic dispositions. When we assess tenant credit quality, we: (i) review relevant financial information, including financial ratios, net worth, revenue, cash flows, leverage and liquidity; (ii) evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant s management team; and (iii) assess the strength/growth of the tenant s industry. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result  
  
   53    

     Table of Contents  

from the tenant s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. The factors considered in determining the credit risk of our tenants include, but are not limited to: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. We are of the opinion that the credit risk of our portfolio is largely mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants  risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.

Results of Operations  
  Revenues 
  The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain revenue information and the dollar amount change year over year (dollar amounts in thousands):  

Rental Income 
  The   decrease   of   $30.4 million   and   $89.0 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015 was primarily due to the disposition of   451   consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2015 and an increase in tenant vacancies, particularly Ovation Brands, Inc., which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 7, 2016.  
  Cole Capital Revenue  
  Cole Capital s results of operations are primarily impacted by capital raised on behalf of the Cole REITs in offerings as well as the timing and extent of real estate asset acquisitions, dispositions and assets under management, which are driven by the Cole REITs  capital raised, cash flows provided by operations and available proceeds from debt financing. 
  Offering-Related Fees and Reimbursements 
  Offering-related fees and reimbursements     include selling commissions, dealer manager fees and/or distribution and stockholder servicing fees earned from selling securities in the Cole REITs. The Company reallows 100% of selling commissions and may reallow all or a portion of our dealer manager and distribution and stockholder servicing fees to participating broker-dealers as a marketing and due diligence expense reimbursement, based on factors such as the volume of shares sold by such participating broker-dealers and the amount of marketing support provided by such participating broker-dealers. The following table represents offering-related fees and reimbursements as well as amounts reallowed during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (in thousands).  

The   increase   in offering-related fees and reimbursements, net of reallowed fees and commissions of   $1.7 million   and   $7.1 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was a direct result of a   $69.8 million   and   $265.1 million   increase in capital raise, respectively, from   $66.6 million   to   $136.4 million   and from   $154.6 million   to   $419.7 million  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015, during which time certain selling agreements for the Cole REITs in their offering stages were suspended, as a result of the Audit Committee Investigation, defined in    Note 2       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    to our consolidated financial statements. The increase in capital raise was due to new broker-dealer relationships, as well as certain broker-dealers lifting the suspension of their selling agreements.

Transaction Service Fees and Reimbursements 
  Transaction service fees and reimbursement     revenue consist primarily of acquisition and disposition fees earned from acquiring and selling properties on behalf of the Cole REITs and other real estate programs. The   decrease   of   $3.6 million   and   $14.1 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, was primarily due to a decrease in property acquisitions from   $315.3 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $173.9 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and a decrease from   $755.8 million   in property acquisitions during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as compared to   $487.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Management Fees and Reimbursements 
  Management fees and reimbursement     revenue represents advisory, asset and property management fees for operating, leasing and managing the portfolios of the Cole REITs and other real estate programs. The   increase   of   $3.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to an increase in the average assets under management from   $6.4 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $7.1 billion   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and an increase in reimbursement revenue of   $1.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015.  
  The increase of   $8.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to an increase in the average assets under management, excluding assets owned by CCIT, as CCIT merged with Select Income REIT on January 29, 2015, from   $6.2 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to   $6.9 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and an increase in reimbursement revenue of   $4.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Operating Expenses 
  The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain operating expense information and the dollar amount change year over year (dollar amounts in thousands): 

Acquisition Related Expenses 
  Acquisition related expenses primarily consisted of legal, deed transfer and other costs related to real estate purchase transactions, including costs incurred for deals that were not consummated. The Company acquired an interest in   one   commercial property for a purchase price of   $20.0 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared with the acquisition of   14   properties for an aggregate purchase price of   $10.2 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in acquisition related expenses of   $1.7 million   and   $5.1 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015 is due to a decrease in costs incurred for deals that were not consummated and lower acquisition volume in 2016.  
  Litigation and Other Non-Routine Costs, Net of Insurance Recoveries 
  The   decrease   of   $3.4 million   and   $38.9 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in legal fees incurred related to the Audit Committee Investigation and related litigation and investigations. Additionally, the Company recognized insurance recoveries of   $11.2 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 in which the Company recognized   $0.9

million   of insurance recoveries, as discussed in    Note 2       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    to our consolidated financial statements. 
  Property Operating Expenses and Operating Expense Reimbursement 
  The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, the property operating expenses, net of operating expense reimbursements, and the dollar amount change year over year (dollar amounts in thousands): 

Property operating expenses such as taxes, insurance, ground rent and maintenance include both reimbursable and non-reimbursable property expenses. Operating expense reimbursement revenue represents reimbursements for such costs that are reimbursable by the tenants per their respective leases. The   decrease   in net property operating expenses of   $2.1 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was due to the disposition of vacant properties and certain properties subject to double-net or modified gross leases and an increase in reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total expenses, offset by an increase in tenant vacancies. The net increase of   $5.7 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in tenant vacancies. 
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  The   decrease   of   $3.1 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in consulting and other professional fees of   $2.5 million  , equity-based compensation of   $1.4 million  , and fees for legal and accounting services of $1.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase to the reserve related to the collectability of program development costs of   $2.5 million  .  
  The   decrease   of   $7.7 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to a decrease of   $7.4 million   in consulting and other professional fees in 2016 as well as a decrease in equity-based compensation of   $3.1 million   primarily due to certain awards which were fully expensed during 2015. Additionally, accounting fees decreased   $1.8 million   and legal fees decreased   $1.5 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the work performed during the first quarter of 2015 in connection with the restatements. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the amount reserved related to the collectability of program development costs of   $6.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
  The   decrease   of   $13.4 million   and   $48.4 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily related to the disposition of   451   consolidated properties subsequent to January 1, 2015. The Company also recorded   $176.2 million   and   $85.3 million   of impairment charges, respectively, on real estate investments during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , which reduced the carrying value being depreciated and amortized.  
  Impairments 
  The Company recorded impairment charges of   $6.9 million   related to seven properties during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . There were no impairments of real estate properties during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  The   increase   in impairments of   $90.9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to management identifying certain properties for potential sale as part of its portfolio management strategy to reduce exposure to office properties, as well as a tenant of   59   restaurant properties filing for bankruptcy during the first quarter of 2016.

Other (Expense) Income and Income Tax Provision 
  The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain financial information and the dollar amount change year over year (dollar amounts in thousands): 

Interest Expense 
  The   decrease   of   $9.7 million   and   $33.0 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in 2015 was primarily a result of a decrease in the total outstanding debt balance from   $8.9 billion   as of   September 30, 2015   to   $6.6 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , largely due to the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under  the revolving credit facility, repayment of   $0.5 billion   of the Credit Facility Term Loan, as well as reducing secured debt with proceeds from the public equity offering and property dispositions.  
  (Loss) Gain on Extinguishment and Forgiveness of Debt, Net    
  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a loss of   $2.0 million   and   $1.8 million  , respectively, in relation to the write-off of deferred financing costs and net premiums consisting of losses relating to the early extinguishment of our 2017 Senior Notes of   $13.2 million  , the prepayment of a portion of the Credit Facility Term Loan of   $4.3 million   as well as the 2016 Term Loan of   $2.6 million   and the repayment of mortgage loans payable prior to maturity of   $0.6 million  , as discussed in    Note 10       Debt    to our consolidated financial statements. These losses were partially offset by a gain on forgiveness of debt of   $19.1 million   related to a property foreclosed upon. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded a gain of   $5.3 million   which primarily related to a gain on forgiveness of debt of   $4.9 million   as a result of the foreclosure of the office building in Bethesda, Maryland as discussed in    Note 10       Debt    to our consolidated financial statements. The Company also wrote off   $0.4 million   of deferred financing costs and net premiums during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   No   such amounts were recorded during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Other Income, Net 
  The   decrease   of   $0.6 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily a result of lower interest income relating to investment securities, including CMBS and mortgage notes receivable, which is partially attributable to a mortgage note and two CMBS reaching maturity and being paid in full subsequent to December 31, 2015.  
  Other income, net   decreased     $6.2 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company determined certain accrued liabilities recorded in connection with mergers and large portfolio acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2014 were no longer obligations of the Company.  The Company also recorded post-closing adjustments during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   related to a multi-tenant asset portfolio sale completed in 2014. Interest income relating to investment securities was also lower in 2016 as compared to 2015.

Equity in Income and Gain on Disposition of Unconsolidated Entities 
  The   decrease   of   $6.6 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily the result of the disposition of   two   unconsolidated joint ventures owning four properties on or after June 30, 2015. 
  The   increase   of   $2.3 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to a gain of   $10.2 million   related to the disposition of   one   property owned by an unconsolidated joint venture during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to a gain of $6.7 million recorded during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   related to the disposition of our interest in one consolidated joint venture. 
  Loss on Derivative Instruments, Net  
  The decrease during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , is due to the termination of   two   interest rate swaps in connection with the early repayment of a portion of the Credit Facility Term Loan, as discussed in    Note 10       Debt    to our consolidated financial statements, which resulted in a   loss   of   $3.3 million  , offset by an increase in the fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps. 
  Gain (Loss) on Disposition of Real Estate, Net    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the change of   $34.7 million   from a   $6.5 million   loss on dispositions of real estate, net to a   $28.1 million   gain as compared to the same period in 2015, is due to the Company s disposition of   78   properties for an aggregate sales price of   $291.2 million  , which resulted in a gain of   $28.5 million  . During the same period in 2015, the Company s loss primarily related to the disposal of a portfolio of 68 CVS properties.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the change of   $108.3 million   from a loss on dispositions of real estate, net to a gain as compared to the same period in 2015, is due to the Company s disposition of   223   properties for an aggregate sales price of   $672.5 million  , which resulted in an aggregate gain of   $50.7 million  , as compared to the disposal of   88   properties for an aggregate sales price of   $675.9 million   during the same period in 2015 for a loss of   $39.3 million  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company also recorded a loss of   $5.0 million   related to assets classified as held for sale, as compared to a loss of   $23.3 million   during the same period in 2015. 
  Provision for Income Taxes    
  The consolidated provision for income taxes of   $1.6 million   and   $1.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to a provision of   $1.5 million   and   $4.8 million   for the same periods in 2015, respectively, reflect an overall decrease in expense primarily related to a lower state income tax rate applicable to the Cole Capital segment in 2016, and a higher state tax expense in the REI segment in 2015, which were partially offset by lower net loss in the Cole Capital segment in 2016, and an increase to federal tax expense due to a return-to-provision true-up in 2016.

Non-GAAP Measures 
  Our results are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We also disclose certain non-GAAP measures, as discussed further  below.   M  anagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures in our internal analysis of results and believes these measures are useful to investors for the reasons explained below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
  Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
  Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has promulgated a supplemental performance measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under U.S. GAAP.  
  NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains or losses from disposition of property, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and impairment write-downs on real estate including the pro rata share of adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We calculated FFO in accordance with NAREIT s definition described above. 
  In addition to FFO, we use AFFO as a non-GAAP supplemental financial performance measure to evaluate the operating performance of the Company. AFFO, as defined by the Company, excludes from FFO non-routine items such as acquisition related costs, litigation and other non-routine costs, gains or losses on sale of investment securities or mortgage notes receivable, insurance recoveries and legal settlements. We also exclude certain non-cash items such as impairments of goodwill or intangible assets, straight-line rental revenue, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, reserves for loan loss, gains or losses on the extinguishment or forgiveness of debt, non-current portion of the tax benefit or expense, equity-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, deferred financing costs, above-market lease assets and below-market lease liabilities. Management believes that excluding these costs from FFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management, and provides investors a view of the performance of our portfolio over time. AFFO allows for a comparison of the performance of our operations with other publicly-traded REITs, as AFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by publicly traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. 
  For all of these reasons, we believe FFO and AFFO, in addition to net income (loss), as defined by U.S. GAAP, are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful in understanding the various ways in which our management evaluates the performance of the Company over time. However, not all REITs calculate FFO and AFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) and are not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs. Neither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other regulatory body has evaluated the acceptability of the exclusions used to adjust FFO in order to calculate AFFO and its use as a non-GAAP financial performance measure.

  Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  General 
  Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: 
             
    fund normal recurring expenses; 
                
    meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt; 
                
    pay dividends; 
                
    fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs;  
                
    pay litigation expenses; and 
                
    fund possible property acquisitions. 
       
  We expect to be able to satisfy these obligations using one or more of the following sources: 
             
    cash flow from operations; 
                
    proceeds from real estate dispositions; 
                
    utilization of existing line of credit; 
                
    cash and cash equivalents balance; and 
                
    issuance of VEREIT debt and equity securities.

Universal Shelf Registration 
  In May 2016, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years. In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include (i) common stock, (ii) preferred stock, (iii) debt securities, (iv) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (v) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares, and (vi) any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. 
  Common Stock Offering  
  On August 10, 2016, the Company issued   69.0 million   shares of Common Stock in a public offering for net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and offering costs, of   $702.5 million   which were used in part to repay amounts under the Credit Facility. 
  Common Stock Continuous Offering Program 
  On September 19, 2016, the Company registered a continuous equity offering program (the  Program ) pursuant to which the Company can offer and sell, from time to time through September 19, 2019 in  at-the-market  offerings or certain other transactions, shares of Common Stock with an aggregate gross sales price of up to   $750.0 million  , through its sales agents. The Company intends to use the proceeds from any sale of shares for general corporate purposes, which may include funding potential acquisitions and repurchasing or repaying outstanding indebtedness. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   shares of Common Stock have been issued pursuant to the Program. 
  2016 Bond Offering 
  On June 2, 2016, the Operating Partnership closed its senior note offering, consisting of (i)   $0.4 billion   aggregate principal amount of   4.125%   Senior Notes due   June 1, 2021   and (ii)   $0.6 billion   aggregate principal amount of   4.875%   Senior Notes due   June 1, 2026  . On July 5, 2016, the Company redeemed all of the   $1.3 billion   aggregate principal amount of our outstanding   2.000%   Senior Notes due February 2017, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and the required make-whole premium. 
  Disposition Activity  
  As part of our effort to optimize our real estate portfolio by focusing on holding core assets, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we disposed of   223   properties and   one   property owned by an unconsolidated joint venture for an aggregate sales price of   $786.0 million  , of which our share was   $748.6 million  , resulting in consolidated proceeds of   $615.2 million   after disposition fees and debt assumptions. We expect to continue to explore opportunities to sell additional properties as we pay off outstanding debt and reduce our borrowings under the Credit Facility, which will reduce our overall leverage and provide us further financial flexibility.  
  Credit Facility 
  Summary and Obligations 
  We, as guarantor, and the Operating Partnership, as borrower, are parties to the Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto.  
  The Credit Facility allows for maximum borrowings of   $2.8 billion  , consisting of a   $0.5 billion   Credit Facility Term Loan and a   $2.3 billion   revolving credit facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , a maximum of   $2.3 billion   was available to the Operating Partnership for future borrowings, subject to borrowing availability.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was   $0.5 billion  , following our net repayment of amounts under the revolving portion of the Credit Facility during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $960.0 million  .  Upon this repayment, there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The remaining outstanding balance on the Credit Facility of   $0.5 billion   is fixed through the use of derivative instruments used to hedge interest rate volatility. Including the spread, which can vary based on our credit rating, the interest rate on this portion was   3.25%   at   September 30, 2016  .  
  
   66    

     Table of Contents  

The revolving credit facility generally bears interest at an annual rate of London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) plus 1.00% to 1.80% or Base Rate plus 0.00% to 0.80% (based upon our then current credit rating).  Base Rate  is defined as the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or a floating rate based on one month LIBOR, determined on a daily basis. The Credit Facility Term Loan generally bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 1.15% to 2.05%, or Base Rate plus 0.15% to 1.05% (based upon our then current credit rating). In addition, the Credit Agreement provides the flexibility for interest rate auctions, pursuant to which, at the Company s election, the Company may request that lenders make competitive bids to provide revolving loans, which competitive bids may be at pricing levels that differ from the foregoing interest rates. 
  The Credit Agreement provides for monthly interest payments under the Credit Facility. In the event of default, at the election of a majority of the lenders (or automatically upon a bankruptcy event of default with respect to the OP or the General Partner), the commitments of the lenders under the Credit Facility will mature, and payment of any unpaid amounts in respect of the Credit Facility will be accelerated. The revolving credit facility and the Credit Facility Term Loan both terminate on   June 30, 2018  , in each case, unless extended in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a   one  -year extension option with respect to each of the revolving credit facility and the Credit Facility Term Loan, exercisable at the Company s election and subject to certain customary conditions, as well as certain customary  amend and extend  provisions. At any time, upon timely notice by the OP and subject to any breakage fees, the OP may prepay borrowings under the Credit Facility (subject to certain limitations applicable to the prepayment of any loans obtained through an interest rate auction, as described above). The OP incurs a fee equal to   0.15%   to   0.25%   per annum (based upon the General Partner s then current credit rating) multiplied by the commitments (whether or not utilized) in respect of the revolving credit facility. In addition, the OP incurs customary administrative agent, letter of credit issuance, letter of credit fronting, extension and other fees. 
  Credit Facility Covenants 
  The Credit Facility requires restrictions on corporate guarantees, as well as the maintenance of certain financial covenants. The key financial covenants in the Credit Facility, as defined and calculated per the terms of the Credit Agreement include maintaining the following:

For the purposes of determining unencumbered asset value, the Company is permitted to include restaurant properties representing more than   30%   of its unencumbered asset value in such calculation such that: (i) from July 1, 2015 to June 29, 2016, up to 40% of the Unencumbered Asset Value may be comprised of restaurant properties; and (ii) from June 30, 2016 to December 30, 2016, up to   35%   of the unencumbered asset value may be comprised of restaurant properties. From December 31, 2016 on, the maximum percentage of unencumbered asset value attributable to restaurant properties will be reduced back down to   30%  . 
  The Company believes that it was in compliance with the Credit Agreement and is not restricted from accessing any borrowing availability under the Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  .

The covenants of our new Senior Notes are materially the same as our existing Senior Notes. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company believes that it was in compliance with these covenants based on the covenant limits and calculations in place at that time.  
  Convertible Debt 
  Summary and Obligations 
  On July 29, 2013, the Company issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2018 (the  2018 Convertible Notes ) and, pursuant to an over-allotment exercise by the underwriters of such 2018 Convertible Notes offering, issued an additional $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2018 Convertible Notes on August 1, 2013. On December 10, 2013, the Company issued an additional $287.5 million of the 2018 Convertible Notes by reopening the indenture governing the 2018 Convertible Notes. Also on December 10, 2013, the Company issued $402.5 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2020 (the  2020 Convertible Notes and, together with the 2018 Convertible Notes, the  Convertible Notes ). The 2018 Convertible Notes have a weighted average interest rate of   3.00%  , a conversion rate of   60.5997   and mature on August 1, 2018 and the 2020 Convertible Notes have a weighted average interest rate of   3.75%  , a conversion rate of   66.7249   and mature on December 15, 2020. The Convertible Notes are convertible into cash or shares of the Company s Common Stock at the Company s option. There were no changes to the terms of our Convertible Notes during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Mortgage Notes Payable and Other Debt 
  Summary and Obligations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had non-recourse mortgage indebtedness of   $2.8 billion  , which was collateralized by   643   properties, reflecting a decrease from December 31, 2015 of   $227.5 million   derived primarily from our disposition activity during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Our mortgage indebtedness bore interest at the weighted-average rate of   5.01%   per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of   4.6   years. We may in the future incur additional mortgage debt on the properties we currently own or use long-term non-recourse financing to acquire additional properties. 
  The payment terms of our loan obligations vary. In general, only interest amounts are payable monthly with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity. Some of our loan agreements require that we comply with specific reporting and financial covenants mainly related to debt coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios. Each loan that has these requirements has specific ratio thresholds that must be met. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company believes that it was in compliance with the debt covenants under its respective loan agreements, except for a loan in default with a principal balance of   $38.1 million   that is described below. 
  On March 6, 2015, the Company received a notice of default from the lender of a non-recourse loan secured by   two   properties, which had an outstanding balance of   $38.1 million   on the notice date, due to the Company s election not to make a reserve payment required per the loan agreement. The foreclosure sale of the first property securing the loan occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016. As the loan was outstanding upon the foreclosure of the first property, the Company recorded a loss of   $3.4 million   in   gain (loss) on disposition of real estate, net   in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The foreclosure proceedings on the second property that secured the loan were completed during the three months ended September 30, 2016. As a result of the foreclosure sale and deed transfer of both properties securing the loan, the Company recognized a gain on forgiveness of debt of   $19.1 million  , which is included in   (loss) gain on extinguishment and forgiveness of debt, net   in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Restrictions on Loan Covenants 
  Our mortgage loan obligations generally restrict corporate guarantees and require the maintenance of financial covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios), as well as the maintenance of a minimum net worth. The mortgage loan agreements contain no dividend restrictions except in the event of default or when a distribution would drive liquidity below the applicable thresholds. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company believes that it was in compliance with the debt covenants under the mortgage loan agreements, except for a loan in default as described above and in    Note 10       Debt    to our consolidated financial statements.  
  Other Debt 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a secured term loan from KBC Bank, N.V. with an outstanding principal balance of   $23.0 million   and remaining unamortized premium of   $0.1 million   (the  KBC Loan ). The interest coupon on the KBC Loan is fixed at   5.81%   annually until its maturity in January 2018. The KBC Loan is non-recourse to the Company, subject to limited non-recourse exceptions. The KBC Loan provides for monthly payments of both principal and interest. The scheduled principal repayments subsequent to   September 30, 2016   are   $2.0 million  ,   $7.7 million   and   $13.3 million   for the years ended   December 31, 2016  ,   2017   and   2018  , respectively. 
  Dividends  
  On August 2, 2016, the Company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.1375   per share of Common Stock (equaling an annualized dividend rate of   $0.55   per share) for the third quarter of 2016 to stockholders of record as of September 30, 2016, which was paid on October 17, 2016. An equivalent distribution was made by the Operating Partnership per OP unit. 
  Our Series F Preferred Stock, as discussed in    Note 15     Equity    to our consolidated financial statements, will pay cumulative cash dividends at the rate of   6.70%   per annum on their liquidation preference of   $25.00   per share (equivalent to   $1.675   per share on an annual basis). As of   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   42.8 million   shares of Series F Preferred Stock(and approximately   42.8 million   corresponding Series F Preferred Units that were issued to the General Partner) and   86,874   Limited Partner Series F Preferred Units that were issued and outstanding.  
  Contractual Obligations  
  The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):   
 ____________________________________ 
           (1) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $242.4 million   of variable rate mortgage notes and   $0.5 billion   of variable rate debt on the Credit Facility effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements. We used the effective interest rates fixed under our swap agreements to calculate the debt payment obligations in future periods. 
              (2) 
    Interest payments due in future periods on the   $9.7 million   of variable rate debt payment obligations were calculated using a forward LIBOR curve. 
      
  Cash Flow Analysis  
  Operating Activities         During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities   decreased     $23.5 million   to   $604.7 million   from   $628.1 million   during the same period in 2015. The   decrease   was primarily due to a decrease in rental receipts related to the disposition of   451   consolidated properties and two unconsolidated joint ventures subsequent to January 1, 2015. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in interest payments and payments related to the Audit Committee Investigation and related litigation, net of insurance recoveries.

     Table of Contents  

Investing Activities         Net cash provided by investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $222.3 million   to   $606.9 million   from   $384.6 million   during the same period in 2015. The   increase   in cash flow is primarily related to an increase in cash proceeds from the disposition of real estate assets of   $202.0 million   as part of the Company s portfolio management strategy, a decrease in development payments of   $45.6 million  , and the receipt of   $50.0 million   on the Affiliate Lines of Credit, as compared to   $10.0 million   in 2015. 
  Financing Activities         Net cash used in financing activities of   $1.2 billion   decreased   $93.7 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $1.3 billion   during the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily related to net proceeds received from the Common Stock Offering, after underwriting discounts and offering costs, of   $702.5 million  , partially offset by an increase in net debt repayments of   $229.4 million   and an increase in distributions paid of   $360.9 million  . 
   
  Election as a REIT 
  The General Partner elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011. As a REIT, except as discussed below, the General Partner generally is not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that it distributes to its stockholders so long as it distributes at least 90% of its annual taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains). REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if the General Partner maintains its qualification for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, federal income taxes on certain income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. We believe we are organized and operating in such a manner as to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for the taxable year ended   December 31, 2016  .  
  The Operating Partnership is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Instead, each partner in the Operating Partnership is required to take into account its allocable share of the Operating Partnership s income, gains, losses, deductions and credits for each taxable year. However, the Operating Partnership may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property. Under the LPA, the Operating Partnership is required to conduct business in such a manner as to permit the General partner at all times to qualify as a REIT. 
  The Company conducts substantially all of its Cole Capital segment business activities through a TRS. A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to corporate federal, state and local income taxes, as applicable. The Company s use of a TRS enables it to engage in certain business activities while complying with the REIT qualification requirements and to retain any income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement to distribute those earnings. The Company conducts all of its business in the United States and Canada and, as a result, it files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, the Canadian federal jurisdiction and various state and local jurisdictions. Certain of the Company s inter-company transactions that have been eliminated in consolidation for financial accounting purposes are also subject to taxation.  
  Inflation 
  We may be adversely impacted by inflation on any leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions. However, net leases that require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.

Related Party Transactions and Agreements 
  There have been no related party transactions to report during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   aside from those with the Cole REITs, as further described below.  
  We are contractually responsible for managing the Cole REITs  affairs on a day-to-day basis, identifying and making acquisitions and investments on the Cole REITs  behalf, and recommending to each of the Cole REIT s respective board of directors an approach for providing investors with liquidity. In addition, we distribute the shares of common stock for certain of the Cole REITs and advise them regarding offerings, manage relationships with participating broker-dealers and financial advisors, and provide assistance in connection with compliance matters relating to the offerings. We receive compensation and reimbursement for services relating to the Cole REITs  offerings and the investment, management and disposition of their respective assets, as applicable. See    Note 17       Related Party Transactions and Arrangements    to our consolidated financial statements in this report for a further explanation of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates 
  Our accounting policies have been established to conform with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to the various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015: 
     Goodwill Impairment; 
     Intangible Asset Impairment; 
     Real Estate Investment Impairment; 
     Mortgage Note Receivables Impairment; 
     Program Development Costs; 
     Consolidation of Equity Investments; 
     Allocation of Purchase Price of Business Combinations including Acquired Properties; and 
     Income Taxes. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  Market Risk 
  The market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to variable-rate borrowings. To meet our short and long-term liquidity requirements, we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes in earnings and cash flows and to manage our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. We would not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We have limited operations in Canada and thus, are not exposed to material foreign currency fluctuations. 
  
   71    

     Table of Contents  

Interest Rate Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt included fixed-rate debt, including debt that has interest rates that are fixed with the use of derivative instruments, with a fair value and carrying value of   $6.8 billion   and   $6.6 billion  , respectively. Changes in market interest rates on our fixed rate debt impact the fair value of the debt, but they have no impact on interest incurred or cash flow. For instance, if interest rates rise 100 basis points and the fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our debt to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise. The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their   September 30, 2016   levels, with all other variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate debt of   $2.5 billion  . A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt of   $2.2 billion  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt included variable-rate debt with a fair value and carrying value each of   $9.7 million  . The sensitivity analysis related to our variable-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their   September 30, 2016   levels, with all other variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates on our variable-rate notes payable would increase or decrease our interest expense by   $0.1 million   annually. See    Note 10       Debt    to our consolidated financial statements.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our interest rate swaps had a fair value that resulted in a liability of   $8.2 million  . See    Note 11       Derivatives and Hedging Activities    to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  
  As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of   September 30, 2016  , it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date. The information presented herein has limited predictive value. Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations. 
  These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rate changes on our borrowing costs and assume no other changes in our capital structure. 
  Credit Risk 
  Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of tenants are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the Company, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. The Company is subject to tenant, geographic and industry concentrations. Any downturn of the economic conditions in one or more of these tenants, geographies or industries could result in a material reduction of our cash flows or material losses to us.  
  The factors considered in determining the credit risk of our tenants include, but are not limited to: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (  i.e.  , expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. We believe that the credit risk of our portfolio is reduced by the high quality of our existing tenant base,  reviews of prospective tenants  risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.
