1. ORGANIZATION  
  WESCO International, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively,  WESCO  or the "Company"), headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a full-line distributor of electrical, industrial and communications maintenance, repair and operating ("MRO") and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") products, construction materials, and advanced supply chain management and logistics services used primarily in the industrial, construction, utility and commercial, institutional and government markets. WESCO serves over   80,000   active customers globally, through approximately   500   full service branches and   nine   distribution centers located primarily in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with operations in   14   additional countries. 
   
  2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
  Basis of Presentation  
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of WESCO have been prepared in accordance with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in WESCO s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 22, 2016. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2015   was derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of that date, but does not include all of the disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
  The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  , the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, in the opinion of management, have been prepared on the same basis as the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and include all adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the results of the interim periods presented herein. All adjustments reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information are of a normal recurring nature unless indicated. The results for the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted certain accounting pronouncements that were effective beginning this fiscal year. The adoption of such guidance, as described below, resulted in certain reclassifications to amounts previously reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2015  .     
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
  The Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. 
  ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
             
    Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2 inputs include inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
  (unaudited) 

Except for WESCO s previously outstanding 6.0% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2029 (the "2029 Debentures"), the reported carrying amounts of WESCO s debt instruments approximate their fair values. As described in Note 7, the 2029 Debentures have been fully redeemed as of   September 30, 2016  . At   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of WESCO s 2029 Debentures was   $177.8 million   and the fair value was approximately   $514.2 million  . The Company uses a market approach to fair value all of its debt instruments, utilizing quoted prices in active markets, interest rates and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving similar instruments. Therefore, all of the Company's debt instruments are classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. For all of the Company's remaining financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, carrying values are considered to approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.   
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The Company adopted this new guidance on a retrospective basis effective January 1, 2016. Accordingly, the Company reclassified approximately $17.7 million of debt issuance costs from other noncurrent assets to long-term debt in the balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  .  
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,   Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).   This updated guidance removes the requirement to categorize investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value (NAV) per share practical expedient within the fair value hierarchy. The amendments in this ASU are effective beginning in the first quarter of 2016 and will be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have an impact on WESCO's financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, this updated guidance will impact the Company's defined benefit plan disclosure in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  . Specifically, investments for which fair value is measured using the NAV per share practical expedient will be removed from the fair value hierarchy in all periods presented. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  . This ASU simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. The Company elected to early adopt this ASU on a prospective basis during the first quarter of   2016  . The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on WESCO's financial position and it had no impact on its results of operations or cash flows.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of Effective Date  . The Company previously reported that in May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   which provides a framework for addressing revenue recognition issues and replaces almost all existing revenue recognition guidance in current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is for companies to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will also result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively, and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition guidance to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  During 2016, the FASB issued three ASUs that address implementation issues related to certain aspects of the new revenue recognition guidance, including ASU 2016-08,   Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , ASU 2016-10,   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , and ASU 2016-12,   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . The amendments in these ASUs do not change the core principles in the revenue recognition standard outlined above. Management is currently evaluating the future impact of this guidance on WESCO's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , a comprehensive new standard that amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases, including the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The new leasing standard requires modified retrospective transition, which requires application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the year of adoption. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on WESCO's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
  (unaudited) 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU affect all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard on WESCO's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  , which introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on certain financial instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard on WESCO's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)  . This ASU provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues where there is diversity in practice. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard on WESCO's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.   The purpose of ASU 2016-16 is to simplify the income tax accounting of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory and to record its effect when the transfer occurs. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods and early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard on WESCO's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 
  Other pronouncements issued by the FASB or other authoritative accounting standards groups with future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to be significant to WESCO s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
   
  3. ACQUISITIONS 
  The following table sets forth consideration paid for acquisitions: 

The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which are primarily for the acquisition of Atlanta Electrical Distributors, LLC, are based upon preliminary calculations and valuations. WESCO's estimates and assumptions for its preliminary purchase price allocation are subject to change as it obtains additional information for its estimates during the respective measurement period (up to one year from the respective acquisition date).  
  Acquisition of Atlanta Electrical Distributors, LLC 
  On   March 14, 2016  , WESCO Distribution, Inc. ("WESCO Distribution") completed the acquisition of   Atlanta Electrical Distributors, LLC  , an Atlanta-based electrical distributor focused on the construction and MRO markets from   five   locations in Georgia with approximately   $85 million   in annual sales. WESCO Distribution funded the purchase price paid at closing with borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The purchase price was allocated to the respective assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. In addition to the cash paid at closing, the purchase price includes a

WESCO INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
  (unaudited) 

contingent payment that may be earned upon the achievement of certain financial performance targets over three consecutive one year periods. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using a probability-weighted outcome analysis and Level 3 inputs such as internal forecasts. This amount has been accrued at the maximum potential payout under the terms of the purchase agreement and it is included in the fair value of liabilities assumed as presented above. The preliminary fair value of intangibles was estimated by management and the allocation resulted in intangible assets of   $21.8 million   and goodwill of   $31.6 million  . The intangible assets include customer relationships of   $15.8 million   amortized over   13   and   14   years, a trademark of   $6.0 million   amortized over   13   years, and non-compete agreements of less than   $0.1 million   amortized over   5   years. No residual value is estimated for the intangible assets being amortized. Management believes that the majority of goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. 
  2015 Acquisitions of Needham Electric Supply Corporation and Hill Country Electric Supply, LP 
  On   October 30, 2015  , WESCO Distribution completed the acquisition of   Needham Electric Supply Corporation  , an electrical distributor focused on the commercial construction and lighting national account markets from   24   locations in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont with approximately   $115 million   in annual sales. WESCO Distribution funded the purchase price paid at closing with cash and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The purchase price was allocated to the respective assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair value of intangibles was estimated by management and the allocation resulted in intangible assets of   $31.0 million   and goodwill of   $35.7 million  . The intangible assets include customer relationships of   $24.5 million   amortized over   12   and   14   years, and trademarks of   $6.5 million   amortized over   13   years. No residual value is estimated for the intangible assets being amortized. Management believes that the majority of goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. 
  On   May 1, 2015  , WESCO Distribution completed the acquisition of   Hill Country Electric Supply, LP  , an electrical distributor focused on the commercial construction market from   nine   locations in Central and South Texas with approximately   $140 million   in annual sales. WESCO Distribution funded the purchase price paid at closing with borrowings under its prior revolving credit facility. The purchase price was allocated to the respective assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair value of intangibles was estimated by management and the allocation resulted in intangible assets of   $21.1 million   and goodwill of   $16.2 million  . The intangible assets include customer relationships of   $13.1 million   amortized over   11   years, non-compete agreements of   $0.2 million   amortized over   5   years, and trademarks of   $7.8 million   amortized over   12   years. No residual value is estimated for the intangible assets being amortized. Management believes that the majority of goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. 
   
  4. GOODWILL  
  The following table sets forth the changes in the carrying value of goodwill: 

(1)     
    Includes a   $15.2 million   adjustment recorded during the   second   quarter of   2016   to correct deferred income taxes related to prior acquisitions. 
      
  5. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  
  WESCO s stock-based employee compensation plans are comprised of stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance-based awards. Compensation cost for all stock-based awards is measured at fair value on the date of grant and compensation cost is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of stock-settled stock appreciation rights and performance-based awards with market conditions is determined using the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation models, respectively. The fair value of restricted stock units and performance-based awards with performance conditions is determined by the grant-date closing price of WESCO s common stock. The forfeiture assumption is based on WESCO s historical employee behavior that is reviewed on an annual basis. No dividends are assumed.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
  (unaudited) 

During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , WESCO granted the following stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance-based awards at the following weighted-average fair values:  

The fair value of stock-settled stock appreciation rights was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions: 

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Daily Yield Curve rates as of the grant date. The expected life is based on historical exercise experience and the expected volatility is based on the volatility of the Company's daily stock prices over a five-year period preceding the grant date. 
  The following table sets forth a summary of stock-settled stock appreciation rights and related information for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :

The following table sets forth a summary of time-based restricted stock units and related information for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :  

Performance shares are awards for which the vesting will occur based on market or performance conditions. The following table sets forth a summary of performance-based awards for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

The fair value of the performance shares granted during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions: 

The unvested performance-based awards in the table above include   76,447   shares in which vesting of the ultimate number of shares is dependent upon WESCO's total stockholder return in relation to the total stockholder return of a select group of peer companies over a three-year period. These awards are accounted for as awards with market conditions; compensation cost is recognized over the service period, regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved and the awards ultimately vest. 
  Vesting of the remaining   76,447   shares of performance-based awards in the table above is dependent upon the three-year average growth rate of WESCO's net income. These awards are accounted for as awards with performance conditions; compensation cost is recognized over the performance period based upon WESCO's determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved.    
  WESCO recognized   $3.4 million   and   $1.9 million   of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. WESCO recognized   $10.4 million   and   $9.7 million   of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $20.5 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements for all awards previously made, of which approximately   $3.5 million   is expected to be recognized over the remainder of   2016  ,   $10.4 million   in   2017  ,   $6.0 million   in   2018   and   $0.6 million   in   2019  .

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the total intrinsic value of all awards exercised was   $10.6 million   and   $15.4 million  , respectively. The gross deferred tax benefit associated with the exercise of awards for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   totaled   $4.0 million   and   $5.6 million  , respectively, and was recorded as an increase to additional capital. 
   
  6. EARNINGS PER SHARE  
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the periods. The dilutive effect of common share equivalents is considered in the diluted earnings per share computation using the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of equity awards and contingently convertible debt.  
  The following table sets forth the details of basic and diluted earnings per share:  

For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the computation of diluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to WESCO International, Inc. excluded stock-based awards of approximately   1.3 million  . For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to WESCO International, Inc. excluded stock-based awards of approximately   1.6 million   and   1.0 million  . These amounts were excluded because their effect would have been antidilutive.  
  Because of WESCO s previous obligation to settle the par value of the 2029 Debentures in cash upon conversion, WESCO was required to include shares underlying the 2029 Debentures in its diluted weighted-average shares outstanding when the average stock price per share for the period exceeded the conversion price of the debentures. Only the number of shares that would be issuable under the treasury stock method of accounting for share dilution were included, which was based upon the amount by which the average stock price exceeded the conversion price. The conversion price of the 2029 Debentures was   $28.87  . As a result of the net loss attributable to WESCO International, Inc. for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , dilutive shares were not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share because their effect was antidilutive. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the effect of the 2029 Debentures on diluted earnings per share attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was a decrease of   $0.13  . For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the effect of the 2029 Debentures on diluted earnings per share attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was a decrease of   $0.17   and   $0.48  , respectively.  
  In December 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $300 million   of the Company's common stock through December 31, 2017. During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the Company entered into accelerated stock repurchase agreements (the "ASR Transactions") with certain financial institutions to purchase shares of its common

stock. In exchange for up-front cash payments totaling   $150.0 million  , the Company received   2,468,576   shares during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASR Transactions was determined by the average of the volume-weighted-average prices of the Company's common stock for each exchange business day during the respective settlement valuation periods. WESCO funded the repurchases with borrowings under its prior revolving credit facility. For purposes of computing earnings per share, share repurchases were reflected as a reduction to common shares outstanding on the respective share delivery dates. 
   
  7. DEBT 
  5.375% Senior Notes due 2024  
  On   June 15, 2016  , WESCO Distribution issued   $350 million   aggregate principal amount of   5.375%   Senior Notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes") through a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2024 Notes were issued at 100% of par and are governed by an indenture (the  Indenture ) entered into on June 15, 2016 among WESCO Distribution, as issuer, WESCO International, Inc., as parent guarantor, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2024 Notes are unsecured senior obligations of WESCO Distribution and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by WESCO International, Inc. The 2024 Notes bear interest at a rate of   5.375%   per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2016. The notes mature on   June 15, 2024  . 
  WESCO incurred costs totaling   $6.0 million   to issue the 2024 Notes, which are recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the debt. The Company used the net proceeds to redeem its 2029 Debentures on September 15, 2016. 
  At any time on or after June 15, 2019, WESCO Distribution may redeem all or a part of the 2024 Notes. Between June 15, 2019 and June 14, 2020, WESCO Distribution may redeem all or a part of the 2024 Notes at a redemption price equal to 104.031% of the principal amount. Between June 15, 2020 and June 14, 2021, WESCO Distribution may redeem all or a part of the 2024 Notes at a redemption price equal to 102.688% of the principal amount. Between June 15, 2021 and June 14, 2022, WESCO Distribution may redeem all or a part of the 2024 Notes at a redemption price equal to 101.344% of the principal amount. On and after June 15, 2022, WESCO Distribution may redeem all or a part of the 2024 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount.       
  The Indenture governing the 2024 Notes contains customary covenants and events of default. Upon a change of control, the holders of the 2024 Notes have the right to require WESCO Distribution to repurchase all or any part of the 2024 Notes at a redemption price equal to   101%   of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
  6.0% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2029 
  On   September 15, 2016  , the Company completed the redemption of its 2029 Debentures. Holders of the 2029 Debentures received cash totaling   $344.8 million  , which was equal to the principal amount of the then-outstanding Debentures, in addition to accrued and unpaid interest.   Holders who surrendered the 2029 Debentures for conversion received 18 shares of WESCO stock for each $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Debentures converted.   In total,   6,267,688   shares were issued at the redemption date closing price of WESCO s common stock. The redemption resulted in a non-cash loss of   $123.9 million  , which included the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
   
  8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
  A majority of WESCO s employees are covered by defined contribution retirement savings plans for their services rendered subsequent to WESCO s formation. WESCO also offers a deferred compensation plan for select individuals. For U.S. participants, WESCO matches contributions made by employees at an amount equal to   50%   of participants' total monthly contributions up to a maximum of   6%   of eligible compensation. For Canadian participants, WESCO matches contributions in an amount ranging from   3%   to   5%   of the participant s eligible compensation based on years of continuous service. In addition, for U.S. participants, employer contributions may be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , WESCO incurred charges of   $18.1 million   and   $17.5 million  , respectively, for all such plans. Contributions are made in cash to employee retirement savings plan accounts. The deferred compensation plan is an unfunded plan. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company's obligation under the deferred compensation plan was   $21.4 million   and   $23.5 million  , respectively. Employees have the option to transfer balances allocated to their accounts in the defined contribution retirement savings plan and the deferred compensation plan into any of the available investment options.

  9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
  WESCO is subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning the identification, reporting and escheatment (the transfer of property to the state) of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and is subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. WESCO Distribution is currently undergoing a compliance audit in the State of Delaware concerning the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property. A third party auditor is conducting the audit on behalf of the State, and the Company has been working with an outside consultant during the audit process and in discussions with the auditors. The Company is defending the audit, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. After the third party auditor completes its field work, it is expected to issue preliminary findings for review by the Company and the State, and thereafter the auditor is expected to issue a final report of examination. If the Company and State do not reach resolution after further discussion, the State issues a demand for payment, which the Company may either agree to pay or appeal, in full or in part. The Company has recorded a liability for unclaimed property based on the facts currently known to the Company. 
  In October 2014, WESCO was notified that the New York County District Attorney s Office is conducting a criminal investigation involving minority and disadvantaged business contracting practices in the construction industry in New York City and that various contractors, minority and disadvantaged business firms, and their material suppliers, including the Company, are a part of this investigation. The Company intends to cooperate with the government investigation. The Company cannot predict the outcome or impact of the matter at this time, but could be subject to fines, penalties or other adverse consequences. Based on the facts currently known to the Company, it cannot reasonably estimate a range of exposure to potential liability at this time.   
   
  10. INCOME TAXES  
  The effective tax rate for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   40.5%   and   20.4%  , respectively. These rates were impacted by the redemption of the 2029 Debentures described in Note 7. The effective tax rate for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   27.4%   and   28.6%  , respectively. WESCO s effective tax rate is generally lower than the federal statutory rate of   35%   due to benefits resulting from the tax effect of intercompany financing and lower rates on foreign earnings, which are partially offset by nondeductible expenses and state taxes.  
  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by   $2.2 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $3.2 million   due to the settlement of outstanding tax matters and the expiration of statutes of limitation. At   September 30, 2016  , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized in the consolidated financial statements was   $4.5 million  . It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately   $0.9 million   within the next twelve months due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and the settlement of state audits. Of this amount,   $0.3 million   could impact the effective tax rate.

  Company Overview  
  WESCO International, Inc., incorporated in 1993 and effectively formed in February 1994 upon acquiring a distribution business from Westinghouse Electric Corporation, is a leading North American-based distributor of products and provider of advanced supply chain management and logistics services used primarily in industrial, construction, utility and commercial, institutional and government ( CIG ) markets. We are a leading provider of electrical, industrial, and communications maintenance, repair and operating ( MRO ) and original equipment manufacturers ( OEM ) products, construction materials, and advanced supply chain management and logistics services. Our primary product categories include general electrical and industrial supplies, wire, cable and conduit, communications and security, electrical distribution and controls, lighting and sustainability, and automation, controls and motors.  
  We serve over   80,000   active customers globally through approximately   500   full service branches located primarily in North America, with operations in   14   additional countries and   nine   distribution centers located in the United States and Canada. The Company employs approximately   9,300   employees worldwide. We distribute over 1,000,000 products, grouped into six categories, from more than   25,000   suppliers utilizing a highly automated, proprietary electronic procurement and inventory replenishment system. 
  In addition, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of value-added capabilities, which includes supply chain management, logistics and transportation, procurement, warehousing and inventory management, as well as kitting, limited assembly of products and system installation. Our value-added capabilities, extensive geographic reach, experienced workforce and broad product and supply chain solutions have enabled us to grow our business and establish a leading position in North America. 
  Our financial results for the first   nine   months of   2016   reflect challenging end market conditions, partially offset by the benefits of cost reduction actions and discretionary spending controls. Net sales   de  creased   $114.2 million  , or   2.0%  , over the same period last year. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was   80.2%   and   80.0%   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses as a percentage of net sales were   14.4%   and   14.1%   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Operating profit was   $250.1 million   for the current   nine   month period, compared to   $283.8 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Operating profit   de  creased due to lower sales, which was partially offset by actions to reduce operating costs. Net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $54.2 million   and   $162.3 million  , respectively. The   de  crease in net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was primarily the result of the non-cash loss related to the redemption of our 6.0% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2029 (the "2029 Debentures"). 
  Cash Flow 
  We generated   $217.2 million   in operating cash flow for the first   nine   months of   2016  . Investing activities included net payments of   $50.7 million  , primarily for the acquisition of Atlanta Electrical Distributors, LLC, and capital expenditures of   $13.2 million  . Financing activities consisted of borrowings and repayments of   $789.4 million   and   $864.4 million  , respectively, related to our revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), borrowings and repayments of   $592.3 million   and   $691.3 million  , respectively, related to our accounts receivable securitization facility (the  Receivables Facility ), proceeds from the issuance of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes") of   $350.0 million  , a payment of   $344.8 million   to redeem our 2029 Debentures and repayments of   $15.0 million   applied to our term loan facility (the "Term Loan Facility"). Financing activities for the first   nine   months of   2016   also included borrowings and repayments on our various international lines of credit of approximately   $89.8 million   and   $96.5 million  , respectively. Free cash flow for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015   was   $204.0 million   and   $159.8 million  , respectively.

Note: Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure provided by the Company as an additional liquidity measure. Capital expenditures are deducted from operating cash flow to determine free cash flow. Free cash flow is available to fund the Company's other investing and financing activities. 
  Financing Availability  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $512.8 million   in total available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in September 2020, and   $109.6 million   in available borrowing capacity under our Receivables Facility, which matures in September 2018.  
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

  Results of Operations 
  Third   Quarter of   2016   versus   Third   Quarter of   2015 
  The following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income and Comprehensive (Loss) Income for the periods presented: 

Net sales were   $1.86 billion   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to $1.92 billion for the third of   2015  , a decrease of 3.6%. Acquisitions had a   2.9%   positive impact on net sales and were partially offset by a   0.3%   impact from foreign exchange rates, resulting in a   6.2%   decrease in normalized organic sales for the   third   quarter of   2016  .

Note: Normalized organic sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure provided by the Company to give a better understanding of the Company's sales growth trends. Normalized organic sales growth is calculated by deducting the percentage impact from acquisitions in the first year of ownership, foreign exchange rates and number of workdays from the overall percentage change in consolidated net sales. 
  Cost of goods sold for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015   was   $1.49 billion   and $1.54 billion, and as a percentage of net sales was   80.3%   and   80.2%  , respectively.  
  SG A expenses in the   third   quarter of   2016   totaled   $255.5 million   versus   $258.2 million   in last year's comparable quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses in the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015   were   13.8%   and   13.4%  , respectively. SG A expenses were down as the cost impact of recent acquisitions and higher payroll expenses were offset by savings from headcount reductions, branch closures and consolidations, and ongoing discretionary spending cost controls.  
  SG A payroll expenses for the   third   quarter of   2016   of   $180.9 million   increased by   $4.8 million   compared to the same quarter in   2015  . The increase in SG A payroll expenses was primarily due to recent acquisitions, partially offset by lower commission and incentive compensation costs.    
  Depreciation and amortization for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015   was   $16.9 million   and   $16.3 million  , respectively. 
  Interest expense totaled   $20.8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $20.4 million   in last year's comparable quarter, an   in  crease of approximately   1.8%  . The following table sets forth the components of interest expense:  

Loss on debt redemption of   $123.9 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   was due to the early redemption of the 2029 Debentures on September 15, 2016. 
  The provision for income taxes for the   third   quarter of   2016   was a benefit of   $21.1 million   compared to income tax expense of   $23.5 million   in last year's comparable quarter. The effective tax rate for the current quarter was   40.5%   compared to   27.4%   in the same quarter in   2015  . The income tax benefit in the current quarter resulted from the redemption of the 2029 Debentures. As adjusted, the effective tax rate for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   28.0%  , which is comparable to the effective tax rate for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Our effective tax rate is impacted by the relative amounts of income earned in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, primarily Canada, and the tax rates in these jurisdictions.

The following table sets forth the adjusted provision for income taxes: 

Note: The adjusted provision for income taxes excludes the benefit from the loss on debt redemption. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and provides a consistent measure for assessing the current and historical financial results. 
  Net loss for the   third   quarter of   2016   of   $31.0 million  , compared to net income of   $62.4 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  , was primarily due to the loss recognized as a result of the early redemption of the 2029 Debentures. Adjusted net income was   $51.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Net income of   $0.6 million   was attributable to noncontrolling interests for the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to a net loss of   $1.1 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily due to foreign currency transactions. 
  Net loss and diluted loss per share attributable to WESCO International, Inc. were   $31.6 million   and   $0.73   per share, respectively, for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with net income and diluted earnings per share of   $63.5 million   and   $1.28   per share, respectively, for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to WESCO International, Inc. were   $51.1 million   and   $1.05   per share, respectively, for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table sets forth adjusted net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. and adjusted earnings per diluted share: 

Note: Adjusted net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. is defined as income (loss) before income taxes plus the loss on debt redemption, less the provision for income taxes excluding the benefit of such loss. Adjusted earnings per diluted share is computed by  
  
   26 

WESCO INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

dividing adjusted net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. by the weighted-average common shares outstanding and common share equivalents. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and provides a consistent measure for assessing the current and historical financial results.

Net sales were   $5.54 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $5.66 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , a   de  crease of   2.0%  . Acquisitions and workdays had positive impacts on net sales of   3.5%   and   1.1%  , respectively, and were partially offset by a   1.2%   impact from foreign exchange rates, resulting in a   5.4%   decrease in normalized organic sales for the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
  The following table sets forth normalized organic sales growth for the period presented:

Note: Normalized organic sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure provided by the Company to give a better understanding of the Company's sales growth trends. Normalized organic sales growth is calculated by deducting the percentage impact from acquisitions in the first year of ownership, foreign exchange rates and number of workdays from the overall percentage change in consolidated net sales. 
  Cost of goods sold for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $4.44 billion   compared to   $4.53 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , and as a percentage of net sales was   80.2%   and   80.0%   in   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The   in  crease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the negative impact of pricing and unfavorable business mix, partially offset by the cost benefits of supply chain management initiatives. 
  SG A expenses in the first   nine   months of   2016   totaled   $799.4 million   versus   $798.0 million   in last year's comparable period. As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses were   14.4%   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   14.1%   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The   in  crease in SG A expenses was primarily due to an increase in costs from recent acquisitions and higher payroll expenses, which were partially offset by savings from headcount reductions, branch closures and consolidations, and ongoing discretionary spending cost controls.  
  
   27 

WESCO INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

SG A payroll expenses for the first   nine   months of   2016   of   $560.8 million   increased by   $6.8 million   compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase in SG A payroll expenses was primarily due to recent acquisitions, partially offset by the effect of headcount reductions and lower commission and incentive compensation costs.   
  Depreciation and amortization for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015   was   $50.3 million   and   $48.3 million  , respectively. 
  Interest expense totaled   $59.1 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $59.9 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , a decrease of approximately   1.4%  . The following table sets forth the components of interest expense:  

Loss on debt redemption of   $123.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was due to the early redemption of the 2029 Debentures on September 15, 2016. 
  Income tax expense totaled   $13.7 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $64.0 million   in last year's comparable period, and the effective tax rate was   20.4%   compared to   28.6%   in the same period in   2015  . The effective tax rate for the current year was impacted by the redemption of the 2029 Debentures. As adjusted, the effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   28.8%  , which is comparable to the effective tax rate for the prior year. 
  The following table sets forth the adjusted provision for income taxes: 

Note: The adjusted provision for income taxes excludes the benefit from the loss on debt redemption. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and provides a consistent measure for assessing the current and historical financial results. 
  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , net income decreased by   $106.4 million   to   $53.4 million   compared to   $159.8 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease in net income was primarily due to the loss recognized as a result of the early redemption of the 2029 Debentures. Adjusted net income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $136.0 million  .  
  Net loss of   $0.9 million   and   $2.5 million   was attributable to noncontrolling interests for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The change in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily due to foreign currency transactions. 
  Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to WESCO International, Inc. were   $54.2 million   and   $1.13   per share, respectively, for the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with   $162.3 million   and   $3.16   per share, respectively, for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to WESCO International, Inc. were   $136.9 million   and   $2.85   per share, respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

WESCO INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The following table sets forth adjusted net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. and adjusted earnings per diluted share: 

Note: Adjusted net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. is defined as income (loss) before income taxes plus the loss on debt redemption, less the provision for income taxes excluding the benefit of such loss. Adjusted earnings per diluted share is computed by dividing adjusted net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. by the weighted-average common shares outstanding and common share equivalents. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and provides a consistent measure for assessing the current and historical financial results. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Total assets were   $4.61 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and $4.57 billion at   December 31, 2015  . Total liabilities were   $2.62 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   $2.80 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Stockholders  equity increased   $218.8 million   to $  1.99 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the redemption of the 2029 Debentures, which had a net impact on equity of   $93.6 million  , foreign currency translation adjustments of   $66.5 million   and net income of   $54.2 million  . 
  Our liquidity needs generally arise from fluctuations in our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service obligations. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $512.8 million   in available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility and   $109.6 million   in available borrowing capacity under our Receivables Facility, which combined with available cash of $70.8 million, provided liquidity of   $693.2 million  . Cash included in our determination of liquidity represents cash in deposit and interest bearing investment accounts. We believe cash provided by operations and financing activities will be adequate to cover our current operational and business needs. In addition, the Company regularly reviews its mix of fixed versus variable rate debt, and the Company may, from time to time, issue or retire borrowings and/or refinance existing debt in an effort to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations and to maintain a cost-effective capital structure consistent with its anticipated capital requirements. On September 15, 2016, we used the net proceeds from the 2024 Notes, which were issued in June 2016, to redeem our 2029 Debentures. As a result, the Company's debt portfolio is relatively balanced between fixed and variable rate debt as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  We monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis, and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions. We also communicate on a regular basis with our lenders regarding our financial and working capital performance, liquidity position and financial leverage. Our financial leverage ratio was   3.6   and   3.8   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. In addition, we are in compliance with all covenants and restrictions contained in our debt agreements as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  
   29 

WESCO INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The following table sets forth the Company's financial leverage ratio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1)   
    Long-term debt is presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets net of deferred financing fees and debt discount related to the convertible debentures and term loan. 
     Note: Financial leverage is a non-GAAP financial measure provided by the Company to illustrate its capital structure position. Financial leverage ratio is calculated by dividing total debt, including debt discount and deferred financing fees, by EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as the trailing twelve months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents totaling   $112.8 million  , of which   $82.6 million   was held by foreign subsidiaries. The cash held by some of our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. We believe that we are able to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for our domestic operations and commitments without repatriation of the cash held by these foreign subsidiaries. 
  We did not note any triggering events or substantive changes during the first   nine   months of   2016   that would require an interim evaluation of impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. We will perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter. To test for impairment, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units, which requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The determination of fair value could be negatively affected by the current economic environment and conditions in the markets in which we operate and those where our customers are based. 
  Over the next several quarters, we plan to closely manage working capital, and it is expected that excess cash will be directed primarily at acquisitions, debt reduction and share repurchases. We remain focused on maintaining ample liquidity and credit availability. We believe our balance sheet and ability to generate ample cash flow provides us with a durable business model and should allow us to fund expansion needs and growth initiatives. 
  Cash Flow 
  Operating Activities.   Cash provided by operating activities for the first   nine   months of   2016   totaled   $217.2 million  , compared with   $176.0 million   of cash generated for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Cash provided by operating activities included net income of   $53.4 million   and adjustments to net income totaling   $163.6 million  . Other sources of cash in   2016   included: an increase in other current and noncurrent liabilities of   $37.0 million  ; and, a decrease in other accounts receivable of   $15.5 million   due to lower supplier volume rebate accruals. Primary uses of cash in   2016   included: a decrease in accounts payable of   $30.3 million  ; an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of   $8.6 million  ; an increase in inventories of   $7.7 million  ; an increase in trade receivables of   $3.1 million  ; and, a decrease in accrued payroll and benefit costs of   $2.6 million  . 
  Cash provided by operating activities for the first   nine   months of   2015   totaled   $176.0 million  , which included net income of   $159.8 million   and adjustments to net income totaling   $92.2 million  . Other sources of cash in   2015   included: a decrease in other accounts receivable of   $64.9 million   due mostly to the reversal of an accrual related to a legal settlement, as well as a decrease in the accrual for supplier volume rebates; and   $30.4 million   from an increase in accounts payable. Primary uses of cash in   2015   included: a decrease in other current and noncurrent liabilities of   $50.2 million   primarily due to the legal settlement referenced above;   $49.8 million   from the increase in trade receivables;   $38.9 million   for the increase in inventories;  
  
   30 

WESCO INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

$20.4 million   for the decrease in accrued payroll and benefit costs; and   $12.0 million   for the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. 
  Investing Activities.   Net cash used in investing activities for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $67.8 million  , compared with   $83.0 million   of net cash used during the first   nine   months of   2015  . Included in the first   nine   months of   2016   were net acquisition payments of   $50.7 million   associated primarily with Atlanta Electrical Distributors, LLC, compared to acquisition payments of   $68.5 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  , which were primarily related to the acquisition of Hill Country Electric Supply, LP. Capital expenditures were   $13.2 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $16.2 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Financing Activities.   Net cash used in financing activities for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $198.1 million  , compared to   $73.3 million   used in the first   nine   months of   2015  . During the first   nine   months of   2016  , financing activities consisted of borrowings and repayments of   $789.4 million   and   $864.4 million  , respectively, related to our Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings and repayments of   $592.3 million   and   $691.3 million  , respectively, related to our Receivables Facility, proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes of   $350.0 million  , a payment of   $344.8 million   to redeem our 2029 Debentures and repayments of   $15.0 million   applied to our Term Loan Facility. Financing activities for the first   nine   months of   2016   also included borrowings and repayments on our various international lines of credit of approximately   $89.8 million   and   $96.5 million  , respectively.  
  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , financing activities consisted of borrowings and repayments of   $987.7 million   and   $939.7 million  , respectively, related to our Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings and repayments of   $232.6 million   and   $132.6 million  , respectively, related to our Receivables Facility, and repayments of   $56.4 million   applied to our Term Loan Facility. Financing activities in   2015   also included borrowings and repayments on our various international lines of credit of approximately   $75.6 million   and   $73.5 million  , respectively. Additionally, financing activities for the first   nine   months of   2015   included the repurchase of   $155.8 million   of the Company's common stock,   $150.0 million   of which was pursuant to the repurchase plan announced on December 17, 2014. 
  Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments  
  There were no material changes in our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that would require an update to the disclosure provided in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that cash generated from operations, together with amounts available under our Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurances that this will continue to be the case. 
  Inflation  
  The rate of inflation, as measured by changes in the producer price index, affects different commodities, the cost of products purchased and ultimately the pricing of our different products and product classes to our customers. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , pricing negatively impacted sales by approximately 50 basis points. Historically, price changes from suppliers have been consistent with inflation and have not had a material impact on the results of operations. 
  Seasonality  
  Our operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal factors. Sales during the first quarter are affected by a reduced level of activity. Sales during the second, third and fourth quarters are generally 5 - 7% higher than the first quarter. Sales typically increase beginning in March, with slight fluctuations per month through October. During periods of economic expansion or contraction, our sales by quarter have varied significantly from this pattern.

Forward-Looking Statements  
  From time to time in this report and in other written reports and oral statements, references are made to expectations regarding our future performance. When used in this context, the words  anticipates,   plans,   believes,   estimates,   intends,   expects,   projects,   will  and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such words. Such statements including, but not limited to, our statements regarding business strategy, growth strategy, competitive strengths, productivity and profitability enhancement, competition, new product and service introductions and liquidity and capital resources are based on management s beliefs, as well as on assumptions made by and information currently available to, management, and involve various risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will in fact prove to be accurate. Certain of these risks are set forth in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , as well as the Company s other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We have undertaken no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  
   
  Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks. 
  There have not been any material changes to our exposures to market risk during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that would require an update to the relevant disclosures provided in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
  Item 4.    Controls and Procedures. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
  From time to time, a number of lawsuits and claims have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including routine litigation relating to commercial and employment matters. The outcomes of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some lawsuits may be determined adversely to us. However, management does not believe, based on information presently available, that the ultimate outcome of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any fiscal quarter of one or more of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period. 
  See the information set forth in Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference in response to this Item.
