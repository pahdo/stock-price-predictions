iShares         S P GSCI              Commodity-Indexed Trust   
    Notes      to Financial Statements (Unaudited)   
   September 30, 2016   
     
   1 - Organization   
     
  The iShares     S P GSCI          Commodity-Indexed Trust (the  Trust ) is a Delaware statutory trust that was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 7, 2006 and commenced operations on July 10, 2006. iShares     Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is the sponsor of the Trust (the  Sponsor ). The sole member and manager of the Sponsor is BlackRock Asset Management International Inc., a Delaware corporation. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. is the  Trustee  of the Trust. The Trust is governed by the Third Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2013 (the  Trust Agreement ), among the Sponsor, the Trustee and Wilmington Trust Company (the  Delaware Trustee ). The Trust issues units of beneficial interest ( Shares ) representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets.  
     
  The Trust holds long positions in exchange-traded index futures contracts of various expirations, or  Index Futures  on the S P GSCI          Excess Return Index ( S P GSCI-ER ). In order to collateralize its Index Futures positions and to reflect the U.S. Treasury component of the S P GSCI          Total Return Index (the  Index ), the Trust also holds  Collateral Assets,  which consist of cash, U.S. Treasury securities or other short-term securities and similar securities that are eligible as margin deposits for those Index Futures positions. The Index Futures held by the Trust are listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the  CME ).   
       
  The Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust s expenses and liabilities.  
       
  The Trust is a commodity pool, as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act (the  CEA ) and the applicable regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the  CFTC ), and is operated by the Sponsor, a commodity pool operator registered with the CFTC. The Sponsor is an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock Fund Advisors (the  Advisor ), an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., serves as the commodity trading advisor of the Trust and is registered with the CFTC.  
     
  The accompanying unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). In the opinion of management, all material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the interim period financial statements have been made. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full-year period. These financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Trust s financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016.  
     
  The Trust qualifies as an investment company for accounting purposes and follows the accounting and reporting guidance under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946,  Financial Services   Investment Companies , but is not registered, and is not required to be registered, as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  
     
   2 - Significant Accounting Policies   

A.    
 
   Basis of Accounting      
     
  The following significant accounting policies are consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

B.    
 
   Investment in Index Futures      
     
  The Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures, including energy commodities, precious and industrial metal commodities, agricultural commodities and livestock commodities. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust s expenses and liabilities.  
     
  The assets of the Trust consist of Index Futures and cash or other Collateral Assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those Index Futures positions. Index Futures are exchange-traded index futures contracts on the S P GSCI-ER and are expected to include contracts of different terms and expirations. The Trust is expected to roll out of existing positions in Index Futures and establish new positions in Index Futures on an ongoing basis. When establishing positions in Index Futures, the Trust is required to deposit cash or other Collateral Assets with the broker as  initial margin.  On a daily basis, the Trust is obligated to pay, or entitled to receive, cash in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its Index Futures positions. Such payments or receipts are known as variation margin and recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When an Index Futures contract is closed, the Trust records a realized gain or loss based on the difference between the value of the Index Futures contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.  
     
  Index Futures are derivative instruments valued at fair value, which the Trustee has determined to be that day s announced CME settlement price. If there is no announced settlement price for a particular Index Futures contract on that day, the Trustee will use the most recently announced CME settlement price unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for valuation. The Trust s derivatives are not designated as hedges, and all changes in the fair value are reflected in the statements of operations.

Table of Contents 

For futures contracts, counterparty credit risk is mitigated because futures contracts are exchange-traded and the exchange s clearing house acts as central counterparty to all exchange-traded futures contracts (although customers continue to have credit exposure to the clearing member who holds their account).  
     
  Please refer to Note 9 for additional disclosures regarding the Trust s investments in futures contracts.  

C.    
 
   Cash and Cash Equivalents      
     
  The Trust considers cash and cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  

D.    
 
   Short-Term Investments      
   
  Short-term investments on the statements of assets and liabilities consist principally of short-term fixed income securities with original maturities of one year or less. These investments are valued at fair value.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Trust had short-term investments held at brokers of $85,000,462 and $66,250,236, respectively, which were posted as margin for the Trust s Index Futures positions.  

E.    
 
    Security Transactions and Income Recognition       
     
  Securities transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are determined using the specific identification method. Interest Income, including amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts on debt securities, is recognized daily on the accrual basis.  

F.    
 
   Income Taxes      
     
  The Trust is treated as a partnership for federal, state and local income tax purposes.  
     
  No provision for federal, state, and local income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements because the Trust is not subject to income taxes. Shareholders are individually responsible for their own tax payments on their proportionate share of income, gain, loss, deduction, expense and credit.  
     
  The Sponsor has reviewed the tax positions as of September 30, 2016, inclusive of the open tax return years, and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Trust s financial statements.  

G.    
 
   Calculation of Net Asset Value      
     
  The net asset value of the Trust on any given day is obtained by subtracting the Trust s accrued expenses and other liabilities on that day from the value of (1) the Trust s Index Futures positions and Collateral Assets on that day, (2) the interest earned on those assets by the Trust and (3) any other assets of the Trust, as of 4:00 p.m. (New York time) that day. The Trustee determines the net asset value per Share (the  NAV ) by dividing the net asset value of the Trust on a given day by the number of Shares outstanding at the time the calculation is made. The NAV is calculated each day on which NYSE Arca, Inc. ( NYSE Arca ) is open for regular trading, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time).  

H.    
 
   Distributions      
     
  Interest and distributions received by the Trust on its assets may be used to acquire additional Index Futures and Collateral Assets or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, distributed to shareholders. The Trust is under no obligation to make periodic distributions to shareholders.  
     
   3 - Offering of the Shares   
     
  Shares are issued and redeemed continuously in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares in exchange for Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets in lieu of cash). Individual investors that are not Authorized Participants cannot purchase or redeem Shares in direct transactions with the Trust. The Trust transacts only with registered broker-dealers that have entered into a contractual arrangement with the Trust and the Sponsor governing, among other matters, the creation and redemption of Shares (such authorized broker-dealers are the  Authorized Participants ). Authorized Participants may redeem their Shares (as well as Shares on behalf of other investors) at any time before 2:40 p.m. (New York time) on any business day in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares. Redemptions of Shares in exchange for baskets of Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets in lieu of cash) are treated as sales for financial statement purposes.

Table of Contents 

4 - Trust Expenses   
     
  The Trust is responsible for paying any applicable brokerage commissions and similar transaction fees out of its assets in connection with the roll of Index Futures held by the Trust. These expenses are recorded as brokerage commissions and fees in the statements of operations as incurred.   
       
   The Sponsor pays the amounts that would otherwise be considered the ordinary operating expenses, if any, of the Trust. In return, the Sponsor receives an allocation from the Trust that accrues daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.75% of the net asset value of the Trust, as calculated before deducting fees and expenses based on the value of the Trust s assets.  
     
  The Sponsor has agreed under the Trust Agreement to pay the following administrative, operational and marketing expenses: (1) the fees of the Trustee, the Delaware Trustee, the Advisor and their respective agents, (2) NYSE Arca listing fees, (3) printing and mailing costs, (4) audit fees, (5) fees for registration of the Shares with the SEC, (6) tax reporting costs, (7) license fees and (8) legal expenses relating to the Trust of up to $100,000 annually.  
      
   5 - Related Parties   
     
  The Sponsor, the Trustee and the Advisor are considered to be related parties to the Trust. The Trustee s and Advisor s fees are paid by the Sponsor and are not a separate expense of the Trust.  
     
   6 - Indemnification   
     
  The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates (as such term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and subsidiaries and agents shall be indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability, claim, cost, expense or judgment of any kind whatsoever (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) arising out of or in connection with the performance of their obligations under the Trust Agreement or any actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and incurred without their (1) negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or (2) reckless disregard of their obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement.  
     
  The Investment Advisory Agreement between the Trust and the Advisor provides that the Advisor and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and subsidiaries shall be indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability, cost, expense or judgment (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) arising out of or in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement or any actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Advisory Agreement and incurred without their (1) negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or (2) reckless disregard of their obligations and duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement.  
     
   7 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities   
     
  In the normal course of business, the Trust may enter into contracts with service providers that contain general indemnification clauses. The Trust s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.  
       
   8 - Financial Highlights   
     
  The following financial highlights relate to investment performance and operations for a Share outstanding for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

(a)    
 
  Based on average Shares outstanding during the period.     

(b)

9 - Investing in Index Futures   
     
  Substantially all of the Trust s assets are invested in Index Futures. The Index Futures  settlement value at expiration is based on the value of the S P GSCI-ER at that time. Therefore, the value of the Trust will fluctuate based upon the value of the S P GSCI-ER and the prices of futures contracts and commodities underlying the S P GSCI-ER. The commodities markets have historically been extremely volatile. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, the average month-end notional amounts of open Index Futures were $806,906,858 and $779,250,970, respectively.

Table of Contents 

10 - Investment Valuation   
   
  FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value as the price the Trust would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Trust s policy is to value its investments at fair value.  
     
  Investments in Index Futures are measured at fair value using the last reported CME settlement price for Index Futures.  
     
  U.S. Treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services. In determining the value of a fixed income investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrixes, market transactions in comparable investments, various relationships observed in the market between investments and calculated yield measures.  
     
   Various inputs are used in determining the fair value of financial instruments. Inputs may be based on independent market data ( observable inputs ) or they may be internally developed ( unobservable inputs ). These inputs are categorized into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three broad levels for financial reporting purposes. The level of a value determined for a financial instrument within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  

Level 1     
 
  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities       

Level 2     
 
  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means  and      

Level 3     
 
  Unobservable inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability, including the Trust s assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments.       

Fair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Trust s net asset value and the prices used by the Trust s underlying index, which in turn could result in a difference between the Trust s performance and the performance of the Trust s underlying index.  
     
  The following table summarizes the value of each of the Trust s investments by the fair value hierarchy levels as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

   Introduction   
     
  The iShares S P GSCI    Commodity-Indexed Trust (the  Trust ) is a Delaware statutory trust that issues units of beneficial interest ( Shares ) representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The Trust holds long positions in exchange-traded index futures contracts of various expirations, or  Index Futures  on the S P GSCI    Excess Return Index (the  S P GSCI-ER ), together with cash, U.S. Treasury securities or other short-term securities and similar securities that are eligible as margin deposits for the Trust s Index Futures positions, referred to as  Collateral Assets.  The Index Futures held by the Trust are listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the  CME ). The Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the S P GSCI    Total Return Index (the  Index ) before payment of the Trust s expenses and liabilities.   
     
  iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is the sponsor of the Trust (the  Sponsor ). BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. is the  Trustee  of the Trust. The Trust is a commodity pool, as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act (the  CEA ) and the applicable regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the  CFTC ), and is operated by the Sponsor, a commodity pool operator registered with the CFTC. BlackRock Fund Advisors (the  Advisor ), an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., serves as the commodity trading advisor of the Trust and is registered with the CFTC. The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust has delegated day-to-day administration of the Trust to the Trustee. The Trustee has delegated certain day-to-day administrative functions of the Trustee to State Street Bank and Trust Company (the  Trust Administrator ). Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware trust company, serves as the  Delaware Trustee  of the Trust.  
     
  The Trust intends to offer Shares on a continuous basis. The Trust issues and redeems Shares only in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares ( Baskets ). Only institutions that enter into an agreement with the Trust to become  Authorized Participants  may purchase or redeem Baskets, in exchange for Index Futures and Collateral Assets with an aggregate value equal to the net asset value per Share, or  NAV  of the Shares being purchased or redeemed. Owners of beneficial interests in Shares ( Shareholders ) who are not Authorized Participants have no right to redeem their Shares. In order to liquidate their investment in the Shares, Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants must generally sell their Shares in the secondary market, assuming that demand for their Shares exists. The price obtained by the Shareholders for the Shares may be less than the NAV of those Shares.  
     
  Shares of the Trust trade on NYSE Arca, Inc. ( NYSE Arca ) under the symbol  GSG.   
     
   Valuation of Index Futures  Computation of the Trust s Net Asset Value   
     
  The Sponsor has the exclusive authority to determine the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV, which it has delegated to the Trustee under the Trust s trust agreement. The Trustee determines the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV as of 4:00 p.m. (New York time), on each Business Day on which NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as soon as practicable after that time. A  Business Day  is a day (1) on which none of the following occurs: (a) NYSE Arca is closed for regular trading, (b) the CME is closed for regular trading or (c) the Federal Reserve wire transfer system is closed for cash wire transfers, or (2) that the Trustee determines that it is able to conduct business.  
     
  The Trustee values the Trust s long positions in Index Futures on the basis of that day s announced CME settlement prices for the Index Futures held by the Trust. The value of the Trust s positions in any particular Index Futures contract equals the product of (a) the number of such Index Futures owned by the Trust, (b) the settlement price of such Index Futures contract on the date of calculation and (c) the multiplier of such Index Futures contract. If there is no announced CME settlement price for a particular Index Futures contract on a Business Day, the Trustee uses the most recently announced CME settlement price unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for valuation. The daily settlement price for each Index Futures contract currently held by the Trust is established on each trading day by the CME shortly after the close of trading for such Index Futures contract, which is generally 2:40 p.m. (New York time).  
     
  The Trustee values all other holdings of the Trust at (a) its current market value, if quotations for such property are readily available, or (b) its fair value, as reasonably determined by the Trustee, if the current market value cannot be determined.  
     
  Once the value of the Index Futures, Collateral Assets, other assets of the Trust and interest earned on the Trust s Collateral Assets has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all accrued expenses and liabilities of the Trust as of the time of calculation in order to calculate the net asset value of the Trust.

Table of Contents 

Once the net asset value of the Trust has been calculated, the Trustee determines the NAV by dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding at the time the calculation is made. Any changes to NAV that may result from creation and redemption activity are not reflected in the NAV calculations for purposes of the Trust s operations until the Business Day following the Business Day on which they occur, but are reflected in the Trust s financial statements as of such first Business Day. Creation and redemption orders received after 2:40 p.m. (New York time) are not deemed to be received, and the related creation or redemption will not be deemed to occur, until the following Business Day. Subject to the approval of the Trustee, Baskets may be created solely for cash, but the related creation orders will be deemed received as of the following Business Day unless received by 10:00 a.m. (New York time). Orders are expected to settle by 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Business Day following the Business Day on which such orders are deemed to be received.  
     
   Results of Operations   
     
   The Quarter Ended September 30, 2016   
     
  The Trust s net asset value decreased from $927,835,646 at June 30, 2016 to $893,148,084 at September 30, 2016. The decrease in the Trust s net asset value resulted primarily from a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations. The decrease in the Trust s net asset value was partially offset by an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 59,800,000 Shares at June 30, 2016 to 60,350,000 at September 30, 2016, a consequence of 6,150,000 Shares (123 Baskets) being created and 5,600,000 Shares (112 Baskets) being redeemed during the quarter.  
     
  The 4.64% decrease in the Trust s NAV from $15.52 at June 30, 2016 to $14.80 at September 30, 2016 is directly related to the 4.49% decrease in the settlement price for the Index Futures. The Trust s NAV decreased slightly more than the settlement price for the Index Futures on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s fees and brokerage commissions.  
     
  Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $48,960,093, resulting from a net realized and unrealized loss of $47,616,185, and a net investment loss of $1,343,908. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized gain of $69,723 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized loss of $47,685,908 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor s fees of $1,679,023 and brokerage commissions and fees of $274,670, the Trust had no expenses during the quarter.  
     
   The Nine   Mont  hs Ended September   30, 2016   
     
  The Trust s net asset value increased from $665,939,247 at December 31, 2015 to $893,148,084 at September 30, 2016. The increase in the Trust s net asset value resulted primarily from a net increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 46,850,000 Shares at December 31, 2015 to 60,350,000 at September 30, 2016, a consequence of 21,750,000 Shares (435 Baskets) being created and 8,250,000 Shares (165 Baskets) being redeemed during the period. The Trust s net asset value also benefited from a net increase in net assets resulting from operations.  
     
  The 4.15% increase in the Trust s NAV from $14.21 at December 31, 2015 to $14.80 at September 30, 2016 is directly related to the 4.68% increase in the settlement price for the Index Futures. The Trust s NAV increased slightly less than the settlement price for the Index Futures on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s fees and brokerage commissions.  
     
  Net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $30,804,999, resulting from a net realized and unrealized gain of $34,613,819, offset by a net investment loss of $3,808,820. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized gain of $157,250 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized gain of $34,456,569 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor s fees of $4,573,543 and brokerage commissions and fees of $737,679, the Trust had no expenses during the period.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  The Trust s assets as of September 30, 2016 consist of Index Futures and Collateral Assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those Index Futures positions. The Trust does not anticipate any further need for liquidity, because creations and redemptions of Shares generally occur in-kind and ordinary expenses are met by cash on hand. Interest earned on the assets posted as collateral is paid to the Trust and is used to pay the Sponsor s fees and purchase additional Index Futures and Collateral Assets, or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, distributed to Shareholders. In exchange for a fee based on the net asset value of the Trust, the Sponsor has assumed most of the ordinary expenses incurred by the Trust. In the case of an extraordinary expense and/or insufficient interest income to cover ordinary expenses, however, the Trust could be forced to liquidate its positions in Index Futures and Collateral Assets to pay such expenses. As of September 30, 2016, the market for Index Futures had not developed significant liquidity and the Trust represented substantially all of the long-side open interest in Index Futures. In addition, it is expected that Goldman, Sachs   Co. or its accountholders may represent, directly or indirectly, a substantial portion of the short-side interest in such market. The existence of such a limited number of market participants could cause or exacerbate losses to the Trust if the Trust were required to liquidate its Index Futures positions.  
     
  The Sponsor is unaware of any other trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to the Trust s liquidity needs.  
     
  Because the Trust trades Index Futures, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of the Index Futures or other assets (market risk) or the inability of counterparties to perform (credit risk).  
     
   Market Risk   
     
  The Trust holds Index Futures positions and Collateral Assets to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those Index Futures positions. Because of this limited diversification of the Trust s assets, fluctuations in the value of the Index Futures are expected to directly affect the value of the Shares. The value of the Index Futures is expected to track generally the S P GSCI-ER, although this correlation may not be exact. The S P GSCI-ER, in turn, reflects the value of a diversified group of commodities. The Trust s exposure to market risk will be influenced by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of the Index Futures market and activities of other market participants.

Table of Contents 

Credit Risk   
     
  When the Trust purchases or holds Index Futures, it is exposed to the credit risk of a default by the CME s clearing house, which serves as the counterparty to each Index Futures position, and of a default by its clearing futures commission merchant. In the case of such a default, the Trust may be unable to recover amounts due to it on its Index Futures positions and Collateral Assets posted as margin. The Trust is also exposed to credit risk as a result of its ownership of U.S. Treasury bills.  
     
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   
     
  The Trust does not use and is not expected to use special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The Trust does not have and is not expected to have loan guarantee arrangements or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services that are in the interest of the Trust. While the Trust s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Trust s financial position.  
       
   Critical Accounting Policies   
     
  The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting policies. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements of the Trust for further discussion of the Trust s accounting policies.  

Item      3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   
     
   Quantitative Disclosure   
     
  The Trust is exposed to commodity price risk through the Trust s holdings of Index Futures. The following table provides information about the Trust s futures contract positions, which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices. As of September 30, 2016, the Trust s open Index Futures positions (long) were as follows:  

The notional amount is calculated using the settlement price for the Index Futures on the CME on September 30, 2016, which was $ 220.57 per contract, and the $100 multiplier applicable under the contract terms.  
     
   Qualitative Disclosure   
     
  As described herein, the Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust s expenses and liabilities. The Index itself is intended to reflect the performance of a diversified group of physical commodities, including energy commodities, precious and industrial metal commodities, agricultural commodities and livestock commodities. The Trust obtains this exposure to commodity prices through the Trust s Index Futures positions. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the Trust s Index Futures are expected to directly affect the value of the Shares.  
     
  The Trust will not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the level of the Index or the S P GSCI-ER, or the value of any Collateral Assets. The Trust s exposure to market risk may be influenced by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of the Index Futures market and activities of other market participants.  

Item      4. Controls and Procedures   
     
  The duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, with the participation of the Trustee, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
     
  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.  
     
  There were no changes in the Trust s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting.
