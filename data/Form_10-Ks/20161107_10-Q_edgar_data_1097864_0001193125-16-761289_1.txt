  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (unaudited)      Note
1:    Background and Basis of Presentation     ON Semiconductor Corporation, together with its wholly-owned and
majority-owned subsidiaries ( ON Semiconductor,   ON,  or the  Company ), uses a thirteen-week fiscal quarter accounting period for the first three fiscal quarters of each year, with the third quarter of 2016 ending on
September 30, 2016, and each fiscal year ending on December 31. The three months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 both contained 91 days. The nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 contained 274
and 275 days, respectively.    The accompanying unaudited financial statements as of and for the quarter and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for unaudited interim financial information. Accordingly, the unaudited financial statements do not include all of
the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for audited financial statements. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the Company s audited financial
statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for audited financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s management, the interim information includes
all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The footnote disclosures related to the interim financial information included herein are also unaudited. Such
financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2016 ( 2015 Form 10-K ). Financial results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for a full fiscal year.  
   Acquisition of Fairchild      On
September 19, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Fairchild ), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Fairchild Agreement ) with each of
Fairchild and Falcon Operations Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary ( Merger Sub ), which provided for the acquisition of Fairchild by the Company (the  Fairchild
Transaction ). Fairchild is a semiconductor company that delivers energy-efficient, easy-to-use and value-added semiconductor solutions for power and mobile designs. See Note 3:  Acquisitions and Divestitures  for additional
information.      Revenue Recognition Policy    
 The Company generates revenue from sales of its semiconductor products to OEMs, electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors.
The Company also generates revenue, to a much lesser extent, from manufacturing and design services provided to customers.    Revenue is
recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title and risk of loss pass to the customer (generally upon shipment), the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues are recorded net of provisions
for related sales returns and allowances.    For products sold to distributors who are entitled to returns and allowances (generally
referred to as  ship and credit rights  within the semiconductor industry), the Company recognizes the related revenue and cost of revenues depending on if the sale originated through an ON or legacy Fairchild process. If the sale
originated through an ON process, revenue is recognized when ON is informed by the distributor that it has resold the products to the end-user. As a result of the Company s inability to reliably estimate up front the effects of the returns and
allowances with these distributors for sales originating through an ON process, the Company defers the related revenue and gross margin on sales to these distributors until it is informed by the distributor that the products have been resold to the
end-user, at which time the ultimate sales price is known. Legacy Fairchild s systems and processes enable the Company to estimate up front the effects of returns and allowances provided to the distributors and thereby record the net revenue at
the time of sale related to a legacy Fairchild process. Although payment terms vary, most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days. Sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience. The Company s OEM
customers do not have the right to return products, other than pursuant to the provisions of the Company s standard warranty. Sales to distributors, however, are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to
discontinued or slow-moving products. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized, and are netted against
revenues. The Company reviews warranty and related claims activities and records provisions, as necessary.

  Freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period
expense when incurred. Taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue-producing transactions, including value-added and excise taxes, are presented on a net basis (excluded from revenues) in the statement of operations.  
   Segments      During the third
quarter of 2016, the Company realigned its segments into three operating segments, which also represents its three reporting segments: Power Solutions Group, Analog Solutions Group, and Image Sensor Group. The results of the System Solutions
Group, which was previously the Company s fourth operating segment, are now part of the three operating segments and previously-reported information has been presented based on the new structure to reflect the current organizational
structure. The Company s Power and Analog Solutions Groups include the business acquired in the Fairchild Transaction. See Note 3:  Acquisitions and Divestitures  for additional information with respect to the Company s
acquisition of Fairchild. See also Note 16:  Segment Information  for additional information on the Company s reportable segments.  
   Use of Estimates      The preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following: (i) measurement of valuation allowances relating to trade
receivables, inventories and deferred tax assets; (ii) estimates of future payouts for customer incentives and allowances, warranties, and restructuring activities; (iii) assumptions surrounding future pension obligations; (iv) fair
values of share-based compensation and of financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments); (v) evaluations of uncertain tax positions; (vi) estimates and assumptions used in connection with business combinations; and
(vii) future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, if applicable. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  
  Note 2:    Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
  ASU s Adopted:       ASU No. 2015-17 -
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 )      In November 2015,
the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early
adoption is permitted on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company elected early adoption as of the interim period beginning October 3, 2015, effective for the annual period ended December 31, 2015, and selected the
prospective application. Prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted.      ASU 2015-05 -  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use
Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  ( ASU 2015-05 )    
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, which provides guidance regarding the accounting for fees paid by a customer in cloud computing
arrangements. ASU 2015-05 amended ASC 350-40-25-16 by removing the language that stated licenses for internal-use software from third parties should be analogized to the subtopic 840-10 Leases. If a cloud computing arrangement includes the
transfer of a software license, then the customer would account for the payment of fees as an acquisition of software. If there is no software license, the payment of fees would be accounted for as a service contract. This ASU is effective in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. An entity can elect to adopt the amendments either prospectively for all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date, or retrospectively. The Company adopted ASU 2015-05
as of the quarter ended April 1, 2016 and selected the prospective application. There was no material impact to the financial statements.

    ASU No. 2015-03 -  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ) and ASU No. 2015-15 -  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit
Arrangements  ( ASU 2015-15 )      In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, which requires that debt issuance costs
related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, which clarified that ASU 2015-03 does not address debt
issuance costs related to line-of-credit agreements and stated that the SEC staff would not object to the deferral and presentation of debt issuance costs as an asset, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit
arrangement, consistent with existing guidance.    The Company elected early adoption of ASU 2015-03 as of the year ended December 31,
2015, applicable to debt issuance costs related to its convertible notes, and retrospectively adjusted certain prior year amounts to reflect the effects of applying the new guidance. Pursuant to ASU 2015-15, debt issuance costs relating to the
Company s revolving credit facility have been deferred and are included in other assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  for additional information with respect to the Company s debt
issuance costs.     ASUs Pending Adoption:       ASU
No. 2016-15 -  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 )    
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which changes how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the
statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the
adoption of ASU 2016-15 may have on its consolidated financial statements and has not elected early adoption as of the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  
   ASU No. 2016-09 -  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU
2016-09 )      In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for
share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 may have on its consolidated financial statements and has not elected early adoption as of the quarter ended
September 30, 2016.      ASU No. 2016-02 -  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 )    
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which amends the accounting treatment for leases. The amendments are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition
approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired
before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 may have on
its consolidated financial statements and has not elected early adoption as of the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

    ASU No. 2016-01 -  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 )      In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,
which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early
adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 may have on its consolidated financial statements.  
   ASU No. 2015-11 -  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU 2015-11 )    
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, which requires that an entity should measure in-scope inventory at the lower of cost and net
realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2015-11 may have on its consolidated financial statements and has not
elected early adoption as of the quarter ended September 30, 2016.      ASU No. 2014-09 -  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ), ASU No. 2015-14 -  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  ( ASU 2015-14 ), ASU No. 2016-08 -  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations  ( ASU 2016-08 ), ASU No. 2016-10 -  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ) and ASU
No. 2016-12 -  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 )    
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which applies to any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or
services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards, superseding the existing revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605  Revenue Recognition. 
Pursuant to ASU 2014-09, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange, as applied through a
multi-step process to achieve that core principle. Subsequently, the FASB approved a deferral included in ASU 2015-14 that permits public entities to apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim reporting periods therein, and that would also permit public entities to elect to adopt the amendments as of the original effective date as applicable to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new guidance allows
for the amendment to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, which clarifies the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which clarifies identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-12, which improves certain aspects of ASC Topic 606  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 are the same as the effective date and transition
requirements of ASU 2014-09.    The Company defers the revenue and cost of revenues on sales to certain distributors until it is informed by
the distributor that the distributor has resold the products to the end customer. For additional information with respect to the Company s revenue recognition policy, see Note 1:  Background and Basis of Presentation.  Upon adoption
of ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, the Company believes one of the more significant impacts will be that it is no longer permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather,
will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. In anticipation of the adoption of the new standards, the Company has been enhancing and continues
to enhance its internal systems, processes and controls for making the required estimates. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company continued the necessary updates and improvements to its systems, processes and controls and
based on its progress intends to adopt the standard as of January 1, 2017.

   Note 3:    Acquisitions and Divestitures   
   Acquisition of Fairchild      On
September 19, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of Fairchild, whereby Fairchild became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price totaled $2,532.2 million in cash and was funded by the Company s borrowings against its Term
Loan  B  Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, as well as with cash on hand. See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  for additional information. The Company acquired Fairchild to expand its product offerings and to create a
power semiconductor leader with strong capabilities in a rapidly consolidating semiconductor industry. The acquisition of Fairchild adds highly complementary product lines, allowing the Company to offer the full spectrum of high, medium and low
voltage products and expands ON s footprint in wireless communication products, particularly in high efficiency power conversions and USB type C communication and power delivery. The acquisition also provides the Company with a platform to
expand its profitability in a highly fragmented industry.    For the period from September 19 to September 30, the Company
recognized approximately $53.1 million of revenue and $17.0 million of net loss relating to Fairchild, which included charges for the amortization of fair market value step-up of inventory, the amortization of acquired intangible assets, and
restructuring.   The following table presents the provisional allocation of the purchase price of Fairchild for the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their fair values (in millions):      
   Acquired intangible assets include $102.4 million of IPRD assets, which are to be amortized over the useful
life upon successful completion of the related projects. The value assigned to IPRD was determined by considering the importance of products under development to the overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the purchased IPRD into
commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. The Company utilized a discount rate of 14.5% and cash flows from its significant
products are expected to commence from 2018 and beyond.    Other acquired intangible assets of $423.4 million include developed technology
of $267.6 million (eleven year weighted-average useful life) and customer relationships of $153.4 million (nine year weighted-average useful life).  
 The total weighted average amortization period for the acquired intangibles is 10.2 years.  
 The acquisition produced $733.6 million of goodwill of which $398.8 million was assigned to the Power Solutions Group and $334.8 million was
assigned to the Analog Solutions Groups. The goodwill is attributable to a combination of Fairchild s assembled workforce, expectation regarding a more meaningful engagement by the customers due to the scale of the combined Company, and
other synergies. Goodwill will not be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present). Goodwill arising from the Fairchild acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.

  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $21.4 million in
acquisition-related costs for the Fairchild acquisition. These costs were recorded in general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
 The initial estimated purchase price allocation is subject to change as the company finalizes its determination relating to the valuation of
net assets, finalization of key assumptions, approaches and judgments with respect to intangible assets acquired from Fairchild. Accordingly, future adjustments may impact the initial estimated amount of goodwill and other allocated amounts
represented in the table above.    See Note 10:  Commitments and Contingencies  for information on contingent liabilities assumed
from the acquisition of Fairchild.      Pro-Forma Results of Operations    
 The following unaudited pro-forma consolidated results of operations for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
October 2, 2015 have been prepared as if the acquisition of Fairchild had occurred on January 1, 2015 and includes adjustments for depreciation expense, amortization of intangibles, interest expense from financing, and the effect of purchase
accounting adjustments including the step-up of inventory (in millions):      
     Acquisition of AXSEM    
 On July 15, 2015 (the  Acquisition Date ), the Company acquired 100% of AXSEM for $8.0 million in cash consideration, plus an
additional unlimited contingent consideration (the  Earn-out ) with a fair value of $5.0 million as of the Acquisition Date. The unlimited Earn-out payment, if any, is based on the achievement of certain revenue targets during two separate
measurement periods consisting of the following: (i) the period from the first day of the Company s third fiscal quarter of 2016 to the last day of the Company s second fiscal quarter of 2017; and (ii) the period from the first day of the
Company s third fiscal quarter of 2017 to the last day of the Company s second fiscal quarter of 2018. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, due to the revisions of the Company s expectations of the Earn-out
achievement, the Earn-out estimated fair value was reduced by $1.3 million to $3.7 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement between the Company and the sellers of AXSEM, $0.8 million of cash consideration was held in
escrow and was included on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet to secure against certain indemnifiable events in connection with the acquisition of AXSEM. There were no indemnification events during the period identified under the
Share Purchase Agreement. Therefore, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company released the $0.8 million of cash consideration held in escrow to the sellers of AXSEM.  
 AXSEM is incorporated into the Company s Analog Solutions Group for reporting purposes. The acquisition of AXSEM expands the
Company s industrial and timing business and is another step forward in expanding the Company s presence in select segments of the industrial end-market.  
 The estimated Earn-out fair value of $3.7 million, measured using Level 3 assumptions, was included in non-current liabilities on the
Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016. See Note 11:  Fair Value Measurements  for additional information.  
 The purchase price allocation of $13.0 million was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2015.

    Divestitures    
 On August 25, 2016, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) accepted a proposed consent order whereby, prior to the closing of the
acquisition of Fairchild, the FTC required the Company to dispose of its ignition planar insulated gate bipolar transistor ( IGBT ) business. In satisfaction of this requirement, on August 29, 2016, the Company sold the ignition IGBT
business to Littelfuse, Inc. ( Littelfuse ). On the same day the Company sold its transient voltage suppression diode and switching thyristor product lines ( Thyristor ) to Littelfuse. The sale of the ignition IGBT and
Thyristor businesses was for $104.0 million in cash. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a gain of $92.2 million after, among other things, transferring inventory of $4.1 million to Littelfuse, writing off goodwill of $3.4
million, and deferring $4.3 million of the proceeds to be recognized in the future. This gain has been presented separately as  Gain on divestiture of business  in the Consolidated Statements of the Operations.  
  Note 4:    Goodwill and Intangible Assets   
   Goodwill      The following table
summarizes goodwill by relevant reportable segments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in millions):      
   Allocation of the $733.6 million of goodwill arising from the Fairchild acquisition to the Company s
reportable segments is preliminary and is subject to change as the Company finalizes its determination relating to the valuation of net assets acquired from Fairchild.  
 The following table summarizes the change in goodwill from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 (in millions):  
   
   Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter unless a triggering event
would require an interim analysis. Adverse changes in operating results and/or unfavorable changes in economic factors used to estimate fair values may result in future non-cash impairment charges. While management did not identify any triggering
events through September 30, 2016 that would require an interim impairment analysis, the Company s current projections include assumptions of current industry and market conditions, which could negatively change, and in turn, may adversely
impact the fair value of the Company s goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. As a result, the carrying value of the reporting units containing the Company s goodwill may exceed their fair value in future impairment
tests. The increase in goodwill is attributable to the Fairchild acquisition. See Note 3:  Acquisitions and Divestitures  for additional information.

     On April 15, 2016, the Company secured capital for the Fairchild Transaction purchase consideration and other general
corporate purposes by entering into (1) a $600 million senior revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) and a $2.2 billion term loan  B  facility (the  Term Loan  B  Facility ), the terms of
which are set forth in a Credit Agreement (the  New Credit Agreement ), dated as of April 15, 2016, by and among the Company, as borrower, the several lenders party thereto, Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as administrative agent
and collateral agent (the  Agent ), and certain other parties, and (2) a Guarantee and Collateral Agreement (the  Guarantee and Collateral Agreement ) with certain of its domestic subsidiaries (the  Guarantors ),
pursuant to which the New Credit Agreement was guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, including a pledge of the equity interests in certain of the Company s
domestic and first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions. The obligations under the New Credit Agreement are also collateralized by mortgages on certain real property assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries. The
proceeds from the Term Loan  B  Facility, along with $67.7 million funded by the Company, were deposited into escrow accounts and included within restricted cash on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet until the close of the
Fairchild Transaction. Upon the close of the Fairchild Transaction, the Company s then current senior revolving credit facility was terminated and replaced by the Revolving Credit Facility, which became immediately available to the
Company.    On September 19, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of Fairchild, whereby Fairchild became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company. The Company funded the acquisition with proceeds from the Term Loan  B  Facility and Company funded amounts previously deposited into escrow accounts, proceeds from a $200.0 million draw against the Company s Revolving
Credit Facility, and existing cash on hand. Proceeds from the Term Loan  B  Facility were also used to pay for debt issuance costs, transaction fees and expenses.

    Amendment of the New Credit Agreement    
 On September 30, 2016, the Company, the Guarantors, the several lenders party thereto and the Agent entered into the first amendment (the
 First Amendment ) to the New Credit Agreement (the  Amended Credit Agreement ). The First Amendment reduced the applicable margins on Eurocurrency Loans to 2.75% and 3.25% for borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility and the Term Loan  B  Facility, respectively, and reduced applicable margins on ABR Loans to 1.75% and 2.25% for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan  B  Facility,
respectively. Additionally, the First Amendment included the following: (i) the Term Loan  B  Facility was increased to $2.4 billion, (ii) certain restructuring transactions and intercompany intellectual property transfers are
permitted in order to achieve efficient integration of the Company, its subsidiaries and acquired entities; and (iii) certain changes were made to the provisions regarding hedge agreements to allow the Company and each of the Guarantors to
enter into certain hedge arrangements that shall be deemed to be  obligations  for purposes of the Amended Credit Agreement which may be collateralized by the collateral granted pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement. The
Company used the additional $200.0 million proceeds under the Term Loan  B  Facility to pay off the outstanding balance under the Company s Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no amounts
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.    Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, the Term Loan  B  Facility matures
on March 31, 2023 and the Revolving Credit Facility will mature on September 19, 2021, the fifth year anniversary of the closing of the Fairchild Transaction. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has borrowed an aggregate of $2.4
billion under the Term Loan  B  Facility. The Term Loan  B  Facility had an original issuance discount ( OID ) of $33.0 million, which was withheld from the proceeds. The OID is amortized using the effective
interest rate method over the term of the Term Loan  B  Facility. The $67.7 million funded by the Company and deposited into escrow accounts is treated as an investing cash outflow. The proceeds from the Term Loan  B 
Facility deposited into escrow accounts are treated as non-cash activities. The release from escrow of the $67.7 million funded by the Company, plus $2.1 million of interest income, is treated as an investing cash inflow, and the release from
escrow of the Term Loan  B  Facility proceeds is treated as a financing cash inflow. See Note 15:  Supplemental Disclosures  and the Company s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for additional information.  
 All borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement may, at the Company s option, be incurred as either eurocurrency loans
( Eurocurrency Loans ) or alternate base rate loans ( ABR Loans ). Eurocurrency Loans will accrue interest for any interest period ending after the date of the First Amendment, at (a) a base rate per annum equal to the
Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) plus (b) an applicable margin equal to (i) 2.75% with respect to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or (ii) 3.25% with respect to borrowings under the Term
Loan  B  Facility. ABR Loans will accrue interest, for any interest period ending after the date of the First Amendment, at (a) a base rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the Federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%,
(ii) the prime commercial lending rate announced by Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, from time to time as its prime lending rate and (iii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one month interest period (determined after giving effect to any
applicable  floor ) plus 1.00%; provided that, the Adjusted LIBO Rate for any day shall be based on the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), subject to the interest rate floors set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement
plus (b) an applicable margin equal to (i) 1.75% with respect to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or (ii) 2.25% with respect to borrowings under the Term Loan  B  Facility. The applicable margin for
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will vary based on a defined net leverage ratio, which is defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. After the completion of the Company s first full fiscal quarter occurring six months after
the closing date of the Fairchild Transaction, the applicable margin for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be decreased if the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio decreases.  
 The Amended Credit Agreement also requires us to pay a commitment fee for the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which will be a
minimum of 0.25% and a maximum of 0.35%, depending on the Company s defined net leverage ratio.    The obligations under the Amended
Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, including a pledge of the equity interests in certain of the Company s domestic and first-tier
foreign subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions. The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are also collateralized by mortgages on certain real property assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries.  
 The Term Loan  B  Facility requires quarterly principal payments equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the Term Loan
 B  Facility starting December 2016. At the maturity date of the Term Loan  B  Facility, any remaining unpaid principal amount shall be due and payable in full.

  The Amended Credit Agreement includes financial maintenance covenants including a maximum
consolidated total net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. It also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The Company was in compliance with its covenants as of September 30,
2016.      Debt Extinguishment, Modification, and Issuance Costs    
 The Company incurred debt issuance costs consisting of legal, underwriting and other fees of $66.6 million related to the Term Loan
 B  Facility, including $22.0 million toward lender fees for the First Amendment. A portion of the debt issuance costs were paid directly from escrowed funds per the terms of the escrow agreement and is reflected as a non-cash
activity. See Note 15:  Supplemental Disclosures  for more information. The Company recorded the Term Loan  B  Facility debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt and is amortizing
them using the effective interest rate method over the term of the loan. The Company performed a debt extinguishment vs. modification analysis on a lender by lender basis upon the execution of the First Amendment. The Company recorded
a debt extinguishment charge of $4.7 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included a $0.3 million write off of unamortized debt issuance costs, $4.3 million in third party fees, and $0.1 million of
lender fees.    The Company incurred debt issuance costs consisting of legal, underwriting and other fees of $8.2 million for
the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company recognized the Revolving Credit Facility underwriter fees and debt issuance costs as deferred costs, which are included in other assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
Company amortizes these deferred costs on a straight line basis over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility from the acquisition closing date, which was the date the revolver became available to the Company. The Company accounted for
the termination and replacement of its senior revolving credit facility by the Revolving Credit Facility as a debt modification and wrote off $1.6 million in unamortized debt issuance costs. The remaining unamortized costs of $2.0 million
related to the terminated senior revolving credit facility are being amortized over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility.     Note

  The number of incremental shares from the assumed exercise of stock options and assumed
issuance of shares relating to restricted stock units is calculated by applying the treasury stock method. Share-based awards whose impact is considered to be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method were excluded from the diluted net income
per share calculation. The excluded number of anti-dilutive share-based awards was 0.3 million and 2.2 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively, and 2.3 million and 1.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively.    The dilutive impact related to the Company s 1.00% Notes and
2.625% Notes, Series B is determined in accordance with the net share settlement requirements prescribed by ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share . Under the net share settlement calculation, the Company s convertible notes are assumed to be
convertible into cash up to the par value, with the excess of par value being convertible into common stock. A dilutive effect occurs when the stock price exceeds the conversion price for each of the convertible notes. In periods when the share
price is lower than the conversion price, the impact is anti-dilutive and therefore has no impact on the Company s earnings per share calculations. Additionally, if the average price of the Company s common stock exceeds $25.96 per share
for a reporting period, the Company will also include the effect of the additional potential shares, using the treasury stock method, that may be issued related to the warrants that were issued concurrently with the issuance of the 1.00% Notes.
Prior to conversion, the convertible note hedges are not considered for purposes of the earnings per share calculations, as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Upon conversion, the convertible note hedges are expected to offset the dilutive effect
of the 1.00% Notes when the stock price is above $18.50 per share. See Note 8:  Long-Term Debt  of the notes to the Company s audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of the 2015 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the conversion prices and other features of the 2.625% Notes, Series B and the 1.00% Notes.      Equity    
  Share Repurchase Program     There were no
repurchases of the Company s common stock under its share repurchase program during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as the Company focused on building up cash reserves for the Fairchild Transaction, which was completed
on September 19, 2016. Information relating to the Company s share repurchase programs during the quarter and nine months ended October 2, 2015 is as follows (in millions, except per share data):

   Shares for Restricted Stock Units Tax Withholding   
 Treasury stock is recorded at cost and is presented as a reduction of stockholders  equity in the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements. Shares, with a fair market value equal to the applicable statutory minimum amount of the employee withholding taxes due, are withheld by the Company upon the vesting of restricted stock units to pay the applicable statutory
minimum amount of employee withholding taxes and are considered common stock repurchases. The Company then pays the applicable statutory minimum amount of withholding taxes in cash. The amount remitted for the quarter and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, was $2.2 million and $10.4 million, respectively, for which the Company withheld 0.2 million and 1.1 million shares of common stock, respectively, that were underlying the restricted stock units that vested. The amount
remitted for the quarter and nine months ended October 2, 2015 was $1.0 million and $12.4 million, respectively, for which the Company withheld less than 0.1 million and 1.0 million shares of common stock, respectively, that were underlying the
restricted stock units that vested. None of these shares had been reissued or retired as of September 30, 2016; however, these shares may be reissued or retired by the Company at a later date. 
  Non-Controlling Interest     The
Company s entity which operates assembly and test operations in Leshan, China is owned by a joint venture company, Leshan-Phoenix Semiconductor Company Limited ( Leshan ). The Company owns a majority of the outstanding equity
interests in Leshan, and the Company s investment in Leshan has been consolidated in its financial statements.    At December 31,
2015, the non-controlling interest balance was $23.7 million. This balance decreased to $23.4 million as of September 30, 2016, resulting from the non-controlling interest s $1.6 million share of the earnings for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, offset by $1.9 million of dividends paid to the non-controlling shareholder.    At December 31, 2014, the
non-controlling interest balance was $20.9 million. This balance was $22.8 million as of October 2, 2015 due to the non-controlling interest s $1.9 million share of the earnings for the nine months ended October 2, 2015.  
  Note 9:    Share-Based Compensation   
 Total share-based compensation expense related to the Company s employee stock options, restricted stock units, stock grant awards and

(1)  
   A majority of the Company s share-based compensation relates to its domestic subsidiaries; therefore, no related deferred income tax benefits are recorded due to
historical net operating losses at those subsidiaries.

  As of September 30, 2016, total estimated unrecognized share-based compensation expense,
net of estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was $0.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 5 months. As of September 30, 2016, total estimated unrecognized
share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested restricted stock units with time-based service conditions and performance-based vesting criteria granted prior to that date was $64.7 million, which is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The Company recorded
cash received from the exercise of stock options of $2.9 million and $5.1 million, respectively, during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company recorded no related income tax benefits during the quarter and nine months
ended September 30, 2016.      Share-Based Compensation Information    
 Share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income is based on awards that are
ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The annualized pre-vesting forfeiture rate for stock options was
estimated to be 11% and 11% during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively. The annualized pre-vesting forfeiture rate for restricted stock units was estimated to be 5% and 5% during the
quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively.      Shares Available    
 As of December 31, 2015, there was an aggregate of 28.7 million shares of common stock available for grant under the Company s
Amended and Restated SIP and 6.7 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP. As of September 30, 2016, there was an aggregate of 21.0 million shares of common stock available for grant under the Amended and Restated SIP and 5.3

     Environmental Contingencies    
 The Company s headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona is located on property that is a  Superfund  site, which is a property listed on
the National Priorities List and subject to clean-up activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Motorola and Freescale have been involved in the clean-up of on-site solvent contaminated soil and
groundwater and off-site contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the State of Arizona. As part of the Company s August 4, 1999 recapitalization (the  Recapitalization ), Motorola retained responsibility for this
contamination, and Motorola and Freescale have agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter.  
 As part of the Recapitalization, the Company received various manufacturing facilities, one of which is located in the Czech Republic. The
Company has ongoing remediation projects at this site to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred prior to the Recapitalization during the years that this facility was operated by government-owned entities. In each case, the
remediation project consists primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located on-site and off-site with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded at each of the respective locations. The government of
the Czech Republic has agreed to indemnify the Company and the respective subsidiaries, subject to specified limitations, for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination. Based upon the information available, total future
remediation costs to the Company are not expected to be material.

  The Company s design center in East Greenwich, Rhode Island is located on property that
has localized soil contamination. In connection with the purchase of the facility, the Company entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the State of Rhode Island. This agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken
and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property. Based on the information available, any costs to the Company in connection with this matter have not been, and are not expected to be, material.  
 As a result of its acquisition of AMIS, the Company is a  primary responsible party  to an environmental remediation and clean-up at
AMIS s former corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Costs incurred by AMIS have included implementation of the clean-up plan, operations and maintenance of remediation systems, and other project management costs. However,
AMIS s former parent company, a subsidiary of Nippon Mining, contractually agreed to indemnify AMIS and the Company for any obligations relating to environmental remediation and clean-up at this location. Based on the information available, any
costs to the Company in connection with this matter have not been, and are not expected to be, material.    The Company s former
manufacturing location in Aizu, Japan is located on property where soil and ground water contamination has been detected. The Company believes that the contamination originally occurred during a time when the facility was operated by a prior
owner. The Company has worked with local authorities to implement a remediation plan and expects remaining remediation costs to be covered by insurance. Based on information available, any costs to the Company in connection with this matter have not
been, and are not expected to be, material.    The Company was notified by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) that it has
been identified as a  potentially responsible party  ( PRP ) in the Chemetco Superfund matter. Chemetco is a defunct reclamation services supplier who operated in Illinois at what is now a Superfund site. The Company
used Chemetco for reclamation services. The EPA is pursuing Chemetco customers for contribution to the site cleanup activities. The Company has joined a PRP group which is cooperating with the EPA in the evaluation and funding of the
cleanup. Based on the information available, any costs to the Company in connection with this matter have not been, and are not expected to be, material.  
 The Company, through the acquisition of Fairchild, acquired facilities in South Portland, Maine and West Jordan, Utah. These two
facilities have ongoing environmental remediation projects to respond to certain releases of hazardous substances that occurred prior to the leveraged recapitalization of Fairchild from National Semiconductor Corporation. Pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement with National Semiconductor Corporation, National Semiconductor Corporation has agreed to indemnify Fairchild for the future costs of these projects. The terms of the indemnification are without time limit and without maximum
amount. The costs incurred to respond to these conditions have not been, and are not expected to be, material. National Semiconductor Corporation was purchased by Texas Instruments Incorporated during the fourth quarter of 2011.  
 Pursuant to the 1999 asset agreement by which Fairchild purchased the power device business of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Samsung agreed
to indemnify Fairchild for remediation costs and other liabilities related to historical contamination at its Bucheon, South Korea operations, up to $150.0 million. Any future payments are not expected to be material.  
   Financing Contingencies      In the
normal course of business, the Company provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either the Company or its subsidiaries, as required for transactions such as, but not limited to, material
purchase commitments, agreements to mitigate collection risk, leases, utilities or customs guarantees. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s Revolving Credit Facility included $15.0 million of availability for the issuance of letters of
credit. There were no letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016. The Company also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of its Revolving Credit Facility totaling $7.3 million
as of September 30, 2016.    As part of obtaining financing in the normal course of business, the Company issued guarantees related to
certain of its capital lease obligations, equipment financing, lines of credit and real estate mortgages, which totaled $135.7 million as of September 30, 2016. The Company is also a guarantor of SCI LLC s non-collateralized loan with
SMBC, which had a balance of $169.9 million as of September 30, 2016. See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  for additional information.  
 Based on historical experience and information currently available, the Company believes that it will not be required to make payments under
the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements for the foreseeable future.

    Indemnification Contingencies    
 The Company is a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which it may be obligated to
indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements. Some of the agreements entered into by the Company require it to indemnify the other party against losses due to IP
infringement, property damage including environmental contamination, personal injury, failure to comply with applicable laws, the Company s negligence or willful misconduct, or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to
such matters as title to sold assets.    The Company faces risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that its
products fail to perform as expected or such failure of its products results, or is alleged to result, in economic damage, bodily injury or property damage. In addition, if any of the Company s designed products are alleged to be defective, the
Company may be required to participate in their recall. Depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors, the Company may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims.
   The Company and its subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors, officers and other persons in accordance with limited
liability agreements, certificates of incorporation, by-laws, articles of association or similar organizational documents, as the case may be. The Company maintains directors  and officers  insurance, which should enable it to recover a
portion of any future amounts paid. On February 19, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a form of indemnification agreement (the  Indemnification Agreement ) and authorized the Company to enter into an indemnification
agreement in substantially the form of the Indemnification Agreement with each of its directors and executive officers (each, an  Indemnitee ). The Indemnification Agreement clarifies and supplements the indemnification rights and
obligations of the Indemnitee and Company already included in the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Under the terms of the Indemnification Agreement, subject to certain exceptions specified in the Indemnification
Agreement, the Company will indemnify the Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law in the event the Indemnitee becomes subject to or a participant in certain claims or proceedings as a result of the Indemnitee s service as a
director or officer. The Company will also, subject to certain exceptions and repayment conditions, advance to the Indemnitee specified indemnifiable expenses incurred in connection with such claims or proceedings.  
 The Fairchild Agreement provides for indemnification and insurance rights in favor of Fairchild s then current and former directors,
officers and employees. Specifically, the Company has agreed that, for no fewer than six years following the Fairchild acquisition, (a) it will indemnify and hold harmless each such indemnitee against losses and expenses (including advancement
of attorneys  fees and expenses) in connection with any proceeding asserted against the indemnified party in connection with such person s servings as a director, officer, employee or other fiduciary of Fairchild or its subsidiaries prior
to the effective time of the acquisition, (b) it will maintain in effect all provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Fairchild or any of its subsidiaries or any other agreements of Fairchild or any of its subsidiaries with
any indemnified party regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses in existence on the date of the Fairchild Agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective
time of the acquisition and (c) subject to certain qualifications, it will provide to Fairchild s then current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the
effective time of the acquisition that is no less favorable than Fairchild s then-existing policy, or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage.  
 While the Company s future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification, other
agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of the Company s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Additionally, the Company does not believe that any amounts that it may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to the Company s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
   Legal Matters      From time to time,
we are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including indemnification claims, claims of alleged infringement of patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, claims of alleged
non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations. We regularly evaluate the status of the legal proceedings in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a
reasonable possibility that a loss, or an additional loss, may have been incurred and determine if accruals are appropriate. If accruals are not appropriate, we further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of possible loss or
range of possible loss can be made for disclosure. Although litigation is inherently unpredictable, the Company believes that it has adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses. It is possible, nevertheless, that the
Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in any particular period by the resolution of a legal proceeding. The Company s estimates do not represent its
maximum exposure. Legal expenses related to defense, negotiations, settlements, rulings and advice of outside legal counsel are expensed as incurred.

  Except as disclosed below, the Company is not involved in any pending or threatened legal
proceedings that it believes could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The litigation process and administrative process at the Patent and Trademark Office are
inherently uncertain, and the Company cannot guarantee that the outcome of these matters will be favorable for it.      Patent Litigation with Power
Integrations, Inc.      There are seven outstanding proceedings with Power Integrations ( PI ), five of which were pending
between PI and Fairchild prior to the acquisition of Fairchild. The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuits filed by PI and believes that it has strong defenses.  
  Power Integrations v. Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. et al. (October 20, 2004, Delaware, 1:04-cv-01371-LPS) : PI filed
this lawsuit in 2004 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Fairchild and its wholly owned subsidiary, Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation. PI alleged that certain of Fairchild s pulse width modulation (PWM) integrated
circuit products infringed four PI U.S. patents and sought a permanent injunction preventing Fairchild from manufacturing, selling or offering the products for sale in the United States, or from importing the products into the U.S., as well as
money damages for past infringement. In the first phase of the trial, in October 2006, a jury returned a verdict finding that thirty-three of Fairchild s PWM products willfully infringed one or more of seven claims asserted in the four patents
and assessed damages against Fairchild. Fairchild voluntarily stopped U.S. sales and importation of those products in 2007 and has been offering replacement products since 2006. Subsequent phases of the trial conducted during 2007 and 2008
focused on the validity and enforceability of the patents. In December 2008, the judge overseeing the case reduced the jury s 2006 damages award from $34.0 million to approximately $6.1 million and ordered a new trial on the issue of
willfulness. Following the new trial held in June 2009, the court found Fairchild s infringement to have been willful, and in January 2011 the court awarded PI final damages in the amount of $12.2 million. Fairchild appealed the final damages
award, willfulness finding, and other issues to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2013, the Court of Appeals vacated almost the entire damages award, ruling that there was no basis upon which a reasonable jury could
find Fairchild liable for induced infringement. The Court of Appeals also vacated the earlier judgment of willful patent infringement. The full Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States have since denied PI s request to review
the Court of Appeals ruling. The Court of Appeals instructed the lower court to conduct further proceedings to determine damages based upon approximately $500,000 to $750,000 worth of sales and imports of affected products, and this case
remains in the District Court of Delaware on that basis. The Company believes that damages on the basis of that level of infringing activity would not be material.  
  Power Integrations v. Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. et al. (May 23, 2008, Delaware, 1:08-cv-00309-LPS) : This lawsuit
was initiated by PI in 2008 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Fairchild, Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, System General Corporation (now named Fairchild (Taiwan) Corporation),
alleging infringement of three patents. Of the three patents asserted in this lawsuit, two had been asserted against Fairchild and Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation in the October 2004 lawsuit described above. In 2011, PI added a fourth
patent to this case. On October 14, 2008, Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation and System General Corporation filed a patent infringement lawsuit against PI in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that certain PWM
integrated circuit products infringe one or more claims of two U.S. patents owned by System General Corporation. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and an injunction preventing the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or importation of PI
products found to infringe the asserted patents. The lawsuits were consolidated and heard together in a jury trial in April 2012, and in April 2012, the jury found that PI infringed one of the two U.S. patents owned by System General
Corporation and upheld the validity of both of the System General Corporation patents. In the same verdict, the jury found that Fairchild infringed two of four U.S. patents asserted by PI and that Fairchild had induced its customers to infringe
the asserted patents. (The court later ruled that Fairchild infringed one other asserted PI patent that the jury found was not infringed.) The jury also upheld the validity of the asserted PI patents. The verdict concluded the first phase of trial
in this case. On June 30, 2014, the court issued an order enjoining Fairchild from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing into the United States the products found to infringe the PI patents in the case as well as certain products
that were similar to the products found to infringe. Willfulness and damages in the case will be determined in a second phase, which has yet to be scheduled and will occur after appeals of the first phase. Fairchild and PI have appealed the
liability phase of this trial to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the appellate court heard arguments held in July 2016.

   Power Integrations v. Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. et al. (November 4, 2009,
Northern District of California, 3:09-cv-05235-MMC) : In 2009, PI sued Fairchild in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that several of Fairchild s products infringe three of PI s patents. Fairchild
filed counterclaims asserting that PI infringes two Fairchild patents. A trial was held in February 2014 on two PI patents and one Fairchild patent. In March 2014, the jury returned a verdict finding that Fairchild willfully infringed both PI
patents, awarding PI $105.0 million in damages and finding that PI did not infringe the Fairchild patent. Both parties filed various post-trial motions, which were denied by the court with the exception of Fairchild s motion to set aside the
jury s determination that it acted willfully. On September 9, 2014, the court granted Fairchild s motion and determined that, as a matter of law, Fairchild s actions were not willful. In addition to the ruling on willfulness,
Fairchild continued to challenge several other aspects of the verdict during post-trial review. Specifically, Fairchild asserted that the damages award included legal and evidentiary defects that were inconsistent with recent rulings by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In November 2014, the trial court ruled that the jury lacked sufficient evidence on which to base its damages award and, consequently, vacated the $105.0 million verdict and ordered a second trial on
damages. In February 2015, the court denied PI s request to enjoin the Fairchild products that were found to infringe, finding, among other things, that the evidence at trial failed to establish a causal connection between the alleged harm and
the alleged infringement. The court ruled that PI can request an injunction after the second trial on damages. The second damages trial was held in December 2015. On December 17, 2015, a jury returned a verdict awarding PI $139.8 million in damages.
Fairchild filed a number of post-trial motions challenging the verdict on several grounds, including several that are similar to challenges to the earlier damages verdict in the case, and the court ruled against Fairchild on these motions. The
Company plans to appeal the current damages award as well as the 2014 verdict finding that the asserted PI s patents were infringed and valid.  
  Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. et al. v. Power Integrations (May 1, 2012, Delaware, 1:12-cv-00540-LPS) : In May 2012,
Fairchild sued PI in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The lawsuit accuses PI s LinkSwitch-PH LED power conversion products of violating three of Fairchild s patents. PI filed counterclaims of patent infringement
against Fairchild, asserting five PI patents. Of those five patents, the court granted Fairchild summary judgment of no infringement on one, PI voluntarily withdrew a second and was forced to remove a third patent during the trial, which began
in May 2015. In June 2015, the jury found that PI induced infringement of Fairchild s patent rights and awarded Fairchild $2.4 million in damages. The same jury found that Fairchild infringed a PI patent and awarded PI damages of $100,000.
    Power Integrations v. Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. et al. (October 21, 2015, Northern District of California,
3:15-cv-04854 MMC) : In 2015, PI filed another complaint for patent infringement against Fairchild in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Fairchild answered and counterclaimed with its own patents. The lawsuit is
in its earliest stages.     ON Semiconductor Corporation and Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC v. Power Integrations, Inc. (August
11, 2016, Arizona, 2:16-CV-02720-SPL) : The Company and Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (collectively  ON Semi ), filed a lawsuit against PI in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Arizona. In the lawsuit, ON Semi is asserting claims of patent infringement on five of its patents directed to aspects of PI s power conversion products. The lawsuit also seeks a claim for a declaratory judgment of
non-infringement on three of PI s patents. Separately, ON Semi filed petitions for  inter partes review  with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking to invalidate claims of those three patents.  
  Power Integrations v. ON Semiconductor Corporation, and Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC (November 1, 2016, Northern District of
California, 3:16-cv-06371) : This lawsuit was initiated by PI in 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
(collectively  ON Semi ), alleging infringement of six patents. Of the six patents asserted in this lawsuit, two had been asserted against POWI by ON Semi in the August 2016 lawsuit in Arizona described above. In the complaint, POWI
alleges infringement and seeks a permanent injunction, unspecified damages, a trebling of damages, an accounting and costs and fees. The lawsuit is in its earliest stages.  
  Litigation with Acbel Polytech, Inc.   
 On November 27, 2013, Fairchild and Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation were named as defendants in a complaint filed by Acbel Polytech, Inc.
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The lawsuit alleges a number of causes of action, including breach of warranty, fraud, negligence and strict liability, and has been docketed as  Acbel Polytech, Inc. v. Fairchild
Semiconductor International, Inc. et al , Case # 1:13-CV-13046-DJC. Acbel seeks damages  in an amount not less than $30 million,  punitive damages, costs and attorneys  fees. The Company is vigorously defending the
lawsuit and believes that it has strong defenses.

   Litigation Related to the Acquisition of Fairchild   
 On December 14, 2015, the Company was named as a defendant in a shareholder class action lawsuit filed in state court in Delaware against the
Company, Merger Sub, Fairchild and certain directors of Fairchild with respect to the Fairchild Agreement entered into between our Merger Sub and Fairchild in November 2015, by which the Company commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Fairchild. The lawsuit alleged breach of duty by the individual defendants and aiding and abetting by the Company and the Merger Sub and was docketed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as Woo v. Fairchild
Semiconductor International, Inc. et al, Case # 11798VCL. In March 2016, the plaintiff amended the complaint to allege that Fairchild s failure to accept the proposal from a third party constituted a breach of fiduciary duty and that certain
disclosures filed on Form 14D-9 were misleading or inaccurate. As relief, the amended complaint sought, among other things, an injunction against the tender offer and the merger that are part of the Fairchild Transaction, an accounting for damages,
and an award of attorneys  fees and costs. On October 26, 2016, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit.

  On December 16, 2015, a purported stockholder in the Company filed a complaint challenging
the tender offer for Fairchild and the merger in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara. The complaint is captioned Cody Laidlaw v. Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc., et al., Case No.
15-cv-289120. The complaint lists as defendants Fairchild, its board of directors, Goldman Sachs and unnamed representatives of Goldman Sachs. The complaint alleges that the board of directors of Fairchild breached its fiduciary duties by
failing to maximize the price to be paid for Fairchild and that Fairchild and the board of directors of Fairchild failed to provide Fairchild s stockholders with all material information needed to make an informed decision whether to tender
their shares of Fairchild common stock in the tender offer. The complaint further alleges that Goldman Sachs and its unnamed representatives aided and abetted the purported breaches of fiduciary duty of Fairchild s board of
directors. As relief, the complaint seeks, among other things, an injunction against the tender offer and the merger of Fairchild with and into Falcon Operations Sub, Inc. and an award of attorneys  fees and costs. Fairchild filed a
motion to dismiss on July 15, 2016. The plaintiff opposed the motion to dismiss on September 16, 2016, and a case management conference is scheduled for December 16, 2016. The Company believes that the suit is without merit and
intends to defend the litigation vigorously. See description of our indemnification obligations to Fairchild officers and directors under the heading  Indemnification Contingencies  above in this Note 10.  
   Intellectual Property Matters    
 The Company faces risk to exposure from claims of infringement of the IP rights of others. In the ordinary course of business, the Company
receives letters asserting that its products or components breach another party s rights. These threats may seek that the Company make royalty payments, that it stop use of such rights, or other remedies.

   Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
 Summarized information with respect to certain of the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is as follows (in millions):      
   During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the contingent consideration for the AXSEM acquisition was
reduced from $5.0 million to $3.7 million due to the revision of the Company s expectations of the Earn-out achievement. See Note 3:  Acquisitions and Divestitures  for further information.

    Other    
 The carrying amounts of other current assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value based
on the short-term nature of these instruments.      Fair Value of Long-Term Debt, Including Current Portion    
 The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s long-term borrowings (excluding capital lease obligations, real estate mortgages
and equipment financing) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows (in millions):      
   The fair value of the Company s 2.625% Notes, Series B, 1.00% Notes, and Term Loan  B  Facility
were estimated based on market prices in active markets (Level 1). The fair value of other long-term debt was estimated based on discounting the remaining principal and interest payments using current market rates for similar debt (Level 2) as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.      Cost Method Investments    
 Investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting are accounted for under the cost method. Accordingly, the
Company accounts for investments in companies that it does not control, or have significant influence over, under the cost method, as applicable. If a decline in the fair value of a cost method investment is determined to be other than temporary, an
impairment charge is recorded, and the fair value becomes the new cost basis of the investment. The Company evaluates all of its cost method investments for impairment; however, it is not required to determine the fair value of its investment unless
impairment indicators are present.    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s cost method investments
had a carrying value of $13.3 million and $12.3 million, respectively.     Note 12:    Financial Instruments   
   Foreign Currencies      As a
multinational business, the Company s transactions are denominated in a variety of currencies. When appropriate, the Company uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on its
results of operations and cash flows. The Company s policy prohibits trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures, or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.  
 The Company primarily hedges existing assets and liabilities associated with transactions currently on its balance sheet, which are
undesignated hedges for accounting purposes.    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had net outstanding
foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts of $102.6 million and $89.8 million, respectively. Such contracts were obtained through financial institutions and were scheduled to mature within one to three months from the time of purchase.
Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject the Company to increased risks from foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities
and transactions to which they are related.

  The following summarizes the Company s net foreign exchange positions in U.S. dollars as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in millions):      
   The Company is exposed to credit-related losses if counterparties to its foreign exchange contracts fail to
perform their obligations. As of September 30, 2016, the counterparties to the Company s foreign currency hedge contracts as well as the cash flow hedges described below are held at financial institutions which the Company believes to be
highly rated, and no credit-related losses are anticipated. Amounts receivable or payable under the contracts are included in other current assets or accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the quarters ended
September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, realized and unrealized foreign currency transactions totaled a $0.5 million loss and a $1.5 million gain, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, realized and unrealized
foreign currency transactions totaled a $3.8 million loss. For the nine months ended October 2, 2015, there was $1.4 million gain recognized from realized and unrealized foreign currency transactions. The realized and unrealized foreign
currency transactions are included in other income and expenses in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  
   Cash Flow Hedges      The Company is
exposed to global market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company addresses these risks through controlled management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to
economically hedge or reduce these exposures. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  
 The purpose of the Company s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the Company from the risk that the eventual cash flows
resulting from transactions in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. The Company enters into forward contracts that are designated as foreign-currency cash flow hedges of selected forecasted payments denominated
in currencies other than U.S. dollars. All the contracts mature within 12 months, and upon maturity, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified into earnings. The Company documents all relationships between
designated hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions.  
 All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value and classified based on the instrument s maturity date. The
Company did not have outstanding derivatives designated as cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2016.    For the quarter and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net loss of zero and $0.2 million, respectively, and a net loss of $2.8 million and $6.2 million for the quarter and nine months ended October 2, 2015, respectively, associated with
cash flow hedges recognized as a component of cost of revenues.     Note 13:    Income Taxes   
 The Company has historically determined its interim income tax provision by applying the estimated effective income tax rate expected to be
applicable for the full fiscal year to the income before income taxes for the period. The effective income tax rate is dependent upon several factors, such as tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income the Company
earns in such jurisdictions. In determining the full year estimate, the Company does not include the estimated impact of unusual and/or infrequent items, which may cause significant variations in the customary relationship between income tax
expense and income before income taxes. Significant judgment is exercised in determining the income tax provision due to transactions, credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.

ON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued   
  (unaudited)       
  The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 55.2%,
which differs from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 35% principally due to the discrete items recorded related to the reversal of the prior years  indefinite reinvestment assertion and release of the U.S. federal valuation
allowance. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on part of its foreign tax credit carryforwards and a full valuation allowance on its capital loss carryforwards, U.S. state deferred tax assets and substantially all of its
Japan-related deferred tax assets.    The consummation of the Fairchild acquisition during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 caused the
Company to reassess the prior years  indefinite reinvestment assertion because of the U.S. debt incurred to fund the acquisition. See Note 7  Long-Term Debt  for additional information. This resulted in a change in judgment
regarding the future cash flows by jurisdiction and the reversal of prior years  indefinite reinvestment assertion. The change in assertion, which resulted in recording a deferred tax liability for future U.S. taxes, had a direct impact on
the judgment about the realizability of the U.S. federal deferred tax assets which resulted in a release of valuation allowance. The change in the prior years  indefinite reinvestment assertion resulted in an increase to income tax expense of
$310.8 million, which was partially offset by a benefit of $267.4 million relating to the release of valuation allowance. The reversal of the prior year s indefinite reinvestment assertion and release of the U.S. federal valuation allowance did
not have an effect on our cash taxes. As of December 31, 2015, the valuation allowance on the domestic deferred tax assets was approximately $330.4 million. The Company has not made an indefinite reinvestment assertion related to current year
foreign earnings.    The Company s policy is to include net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the
provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company had approximately $4.7 million and $4.6 million of net interest and penalties accrued at September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively.  
 Although the Company cannot predict the timing of resolution with taxing authorities, if any, it believes it is reasonably possible
that $3.3 million of its unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced in the next twelve months due to settlement with tax authorities or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.  
 Tax years prior to 2012 are generally not subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Services ( IRS ) except for items involving
tax attributes that have been carried forward to tax years whose statute of limitations remains open. The Company is not currently under IRS examination. For state returns, the Company is generally not subject to income tax examinations for
years prior to 2011. The Company is also subject to routine examinations by various foreign tax jurisdictions in which it operates. With respect to significant jurisdictions outside the United States, the Company s subsidiaries are no
longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2006. The Company is currently under audit in the following significant jurisdictions: Malaysia, China, Philippines, and Japan.

    Note 16:    Segment Information   
 During the third quarter of 2016, the Company realigned its segments into three operating segments to optimize efficiencies resulting from the
acquisition of Fairchild. These operating segments also represent its three reporting segments: Power Solutions Group, Analog Solutions Group, and Image Sensor Group. The results of the System Solutions Group, which was previously the
Company s fourth operating segment, and which did not have goodwill, are now part of the three operating segments and previously-reported information has been presented based on the new structure to reflect the current organizational
structure. The Company s Power and Analog Solutions Groups include the business acquired in the Fairchild Transaction. See Note 3:  Acquisitions and Divestitures  for additional information with respect to the Company s
acquisition of Fairchild.    Each of the Company s major product lines has been examined, and each product line has been assigned to a
reportable segment based on the Company s operating strategy. Because many products are sold into different end-markets, the total revenue reported for a segment is not indicative of actual sales in the end-market associated with that segment,
but rather is the sum of the revenue from the product lines assigned to that segment. These segments represent the Company s view of the business and as such are used to evaluate progress of major initiatives and allocation of resources.

Ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $880.5 million       Executive Overview
    This Executive Overview presents summary information regarding ON Semiconductor Corporation and its subsidiaries 
( we,   us,   our,   ON Semiconductor,  or the  Company ) industry, markets, business and operating trends only. For further information regarding the events summarized herein, see Item 2
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in its entirety.      Industry Overview
     We participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by the WSTS group to evaluate overall semiconductor market
trends and to track our progress against the market in the areas we provide semiconductor components. The most recently published estimates from WSTS project a compound annual growth rate in our serviceable addressable market of approximately 4.5%
during 2016 through 2018. These are not our projections and may not be indicative of actual results. We, like many of our competitors, view this information as helpful third party projections and estimates.  
  Business Overview     ON Semiconductor is
driving innovation in energy efficient electronics. Our extensive portfolio of sensors, connectivity, power management, analog, logic, timing, discrete, and custom devices helps customers efficiently solve their design challenges in advanced
electronic systems and products. Our power management and motor driver semiconductor components control, convert, protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices. Our custom ASICs use
analog, DSP, mixed-signal and advanced logic capabilities to act as the brain behind many of our automotive, medical, military/aerospace, consumer and industrial customers  products. Our signal management semiconductor components provide
high-performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing, communications and industrial systems. Our image sensors, optical image stabilization and auto focus devices provide advanced imaging solutions for automotive,
wireless, industrial and consumer applications. Our standard semiconductor components serve as  building blocks  within virtually all types of electronic devices. These various products fall into the logic, analog, discrete, image sensor
and memory categories used by the WSTS group.    We serve a broad base of end-user markets, including automotive, communications, computing,
consumer electronics, medical, industrial electronics, networking and aerospace/defense. Our devices are found in a wide variety of end-products including automotive electronics, smartphones, media tablets, wearable electronics, personal computers,

  Our portfolio of devices enables us to offer advanced ICs and the  building block 
components that deliver system level functionality and design solutions. Our extensive product portfolio consisted of approximately 80,000 products as of September 30, 2016 and we shipped approximately 42.0 billion units in the first nine
months of 2016, as compared to 36.6 billion units in the first nine months of 2015. We offer micro packages, which provide increased performance characteristics while reducing the critical board space inside today s ever shrinking electronic
devices and power modules, delivering improved energy efficiency and reliability for a wide variety of high power applications. We believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products, combined with our global manufacturing and logistics
network, provides our customers with single source purchasing on a cost-effective and timely basis.      Acquisition of Fairchild    
 On September 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc., a Delaware corporation
( Fairchild ), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Fairchild Agreement ) with each of Fairchild and Falcon Operations Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary ( Merger Sub ),
which provided for the acquisition of Fairchild by us (the  Fairchild Transaction ). The purchase price totaled $2,532.2 million and was funded by the borrowings against our Term Loan  B  Facility and Revolving Credit
Facility (as such terms are defined below under  Key Financing and Capital Events Fairchild Transaction Financing ) and with cash on hand. See Note 3:  Acquisitions and Divestitures .  
 We believe that this acquisition creates a power semiconductor leader with strong capabilities in a rapidly consolidating semiconductor
industry. Ultimately, we believe that the combination of Fairchild operations with our own will provide complementary product lines to offer customers the full spectrum of high, medium and low voltage products, and we will continue to pioneer
technology and design innovation in efficient energy consumption to help our customers achieve success and drive value for our partners and employees around the world. We believe the acquisition also expands our footprint in wireless
communication products, particularly in high efficiency power conversions and USB type C communication and power delivery. See Note 3:  Acquisitions and Divestitures,  Note 5:  Restructuring, Asset Impairment and Other, Net, 
Note 6:  Balance Sheet Information,  Note 7:  Long-Term Debt,  and Note 13:  Income Taxes  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information
about the acquisition of Fairchild.      Segments    
 During the third quarter of 2016, the Company realigned its segments into three operating segments, which also represent its three reporting
segments: Power Solutions Group, Analog Solutions Group, and Image Sensor Group. The results of the System Solutions Group, which was previously the Company s fourth operating segment, are now part of the three reporting segments and
previously-reported information has been presented based on the new structure to reflect the current organizational structure. The Company s Power and Analog Solutions Groups include the business acquired in the Fairchild
Transaction. Each of our major product lines has been assigned to a segment based on our operating strategy.    As many products are
sold into different end-markets, the total revenue reported for a segment is not indicative of actual sales in the end-market associated with that segment, but rather is the sum of the revenues from the product lines assigned to that segment. From
time to time, we reassess the alignment of our product families and devices associated with our reportable segments and may move product families or individual devices from one reportable segment to another.  
   Business and Macroeconomic Environment    
 We have recognized efficiencies from restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to
improve our cost structure. The semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical, has often experienced significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions, and may experience
significant uncertainty and volatility in the future. We have historically reviewed, and will continue to review, our cost structure, capital investments and other expenditures to align our spending and capacity with our current sales and
manufacturing projections.    We have historically taken significant actions to align our overall cost structure with our expected revenue
levels, and focusing on synergies related cost reductions from each of our acquisitions. See  Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other, Net  under the heading  Results of Operations -- Quarter Ended September 30, 2016

   Outlook   
   ON Semiconductor Fourth Quarter 2016 Outlook    
 Based upon product booking trends, backlog levels, and estimated turns levels, we estimate that our revenues will be approximately $1,190 to
$1,240 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Backlog levels for the fourth quarter of 2016 represent approximately 80% to 85% of our anticipated fourth quarter 2016 revenues. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we estimate that gross margin as a
percentage of revenues will be approximately 27.4% to 29.5%.     Results of Operations   
   Quarter Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Quarter Ended October 2, 2015    
 The following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our unaudited consolidated
financial statements for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 (in millions):      
     Revenues    
 Revenues were $950.9 million and $904.2 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively,
representing an increase of $46.7 million or approximately 5%. The increase is primarily attributed to an increase in revenue in our Power Solutions and Analog Solutions Groups, which included Fairchild revenues of $53.1 million between September
19, 2016 and September 30, 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower revenues in our Image Sensor Group due to a weakened demand environment.

   Revenues from the Analog Solutions Group increased by $16.5 million, or approximately 4.8%, for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the
third quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Fairchild, which had revenues of $17.8 million attributable to this segment between September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016.  
 Revenues from the Image Sensor Group decreased by $18.6 million, or approximately 9.4%, for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third
quarter of 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to a $25.4 million, or approximately 15.4%, decrease in revenues from our CMOS Image Sensor products, partially offset by a $3.6 million, or approximately 14.8%, increase in revenues from our
ASIC products and a $3.2 million increase in revenues from our LSI products.    Revenues from the Power Solutions Group increased by $48.8
million, or approximately 13.6%, for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Fairchild, which had $35.3 million in revenues attributable to this segment between
September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016, and to a $9.2 million, or approximately 48.5%, increase in revenues from our IPM products.  
 Revenues by geographic location, including local sales made by operations within each area, based on sales billed from the respective country
for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, are summarized as follows (dollars in millions):      
         
  (1)  Certain amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts.  
 A majority of our end customers, served directly or through distribution channels, are manufacturers of electronic devices. For the quarters
ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, we had no single customer that accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues.      Gross
Profit and Gross Margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below)      Our gross profit by
reportable segment for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 was as follows (dollars in millions):      
        (1)  Certain amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts.

  Our gross profit was $329.0 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $308.5 million in
the third quarter of 2015. The gross profit increase of $20.5 million, or approximately 7%, is primarily due to an increase in gross profit in our Power Solutions Group and Analog Solutions Group, which included Fairchild gross profit of
$11.5 million between September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower gross profit in our Image Sensor Group and by the expensing of the fair market value of inventory step-up from the Fairchild
acquisition.    Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to approximately 34.6% in the third quarter of 2016 from approximately
34.1% in the third quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily driven by changes in volume and mix across certain product lines.      Operating
Expenses      Research and development expenses were $111.5 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $104.9 million for the
third quarter of 2015, representing an increase of $6.6 million, or approximately 6%. This increase is primarily associated with higher payroll expenses, including incentive compensation and payroll related costs, partially offset by lower travel
expenses. Fairchild s research and development expenses between September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016 were $3.1 million and were primarily payroll related costs.  
 Selling and marketing expenses were $56.7 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $52.3 million for the third quarter of 2015,
representing an increase of $4.4 million, or approximately 8%. This increase is primarily associated with higher payroll expenses, including incentive compensation and payroll related costs, partially offset by lower travel
expenses. Fairchild s selling and marketing expenses between September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016 were $3.5 million and were primarily payroll related costs.  
 General and administrative expenses were $67.6 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $44.9 million in the third quarter of 2015,
representing an increase of $22.7 million, or approximately 51%. This increase is primarily associated with $17.8 million of acquisition-related expenses and higher payroll expenses, including incentive compensation and payroll related
costs incurred during the third quarter of 2016. Fairchild s general and administrative expenses between September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016 were $3.1 million and were primarily payroll related costs.  
   Other Operating Expenses       Amortization of
Acquisition Related Intangible Assets     Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $24.7 million and $33.6 million
for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of $8.9 million, or approximately 26.5%. The decrease in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is attributable to the
declining amortization of our Aptina and Truesense intangible assets, offset partially by the amortization of our intangible assets acquired from the Fairchild acquisition. See Note 3:  Acquisition and Divestitures  and Note 4:
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information with respect to intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible
assets from the Fairchild Transaction was $1.6 million between September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016.     Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other,
Net     Restructuring, asset impairments and other, net resulted in expense of $21.8 million for the quarter ended September 30,
2016 compared to $3.3 million for the quarter ended October 2, 2015. The information below summarizes certain activities for each respective quarter. See Note 5:  Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other, Net  of the notes to our
unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information.     Quarter Ended September 30, 2016
    During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we recorded approximately $21.8 million of charges related to our restructuring
programs, consisting primarily of employee separation charges from our workforce reduction and manufacturing relocation programs.     Quarter Ended
October 2, 2015     During the quarter ended October 2, 2015, we recorded approximately $1.7 million of charges related to our
restructuring programs, primarily consisting of $1.2 million of employee separation charges from our general workforce reductions.

    Interest Expense    
 Interest expense increased by $31.8 million to $46.7 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $14.9 million during
the quarter ended October 2, 2015 as a result of borrowings under the Term Loan  B  Facility. Our average gross long-term debt balance (including current maturities) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $3,741.7 million
at a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 5.0%, compared to $1,510.0 million at a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 4.0% for the quarter ended October 2, 2015.  
   Loss on Modification or Extinguishment of Debt    
 Loss on modification or extinguishment of debt increased by $6.3 million to $6.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016
compared to zero during the quarter ended October 2, 2015, due to the execution of the First Amendment, which resulted in a debt extinguishment charge of $4.7 million, and the termination and replacement of our senior revolving credit facility
by the Revolving Credit Facility, which resulted in a debt modification and write-off of $1.6 million in unamortized debt issuance costs. See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  for further information.  
   Gain on Divestiture of Business    
 Gain on divestiture of business increased by $92.2 million to $92.2 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to zero
during the quarter ended October 2, 2015. On August 29, 2016, the Company sold two lines of business for $104.0 million in cash. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a gain of $92.2 million after, among other things,
transferring inventory of $4.1 million to Littelfuse, Inc. ( Littelfuse ), writing off goodwill of $3.4 million, and deferring $4.3 million of the proceeds to be recognized in the future. See Note 3:  Acquisitions and
Divestitures  for further information.      Other    
 Other income and expense decreased by $2.1 million to an expense of $0.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to
income of $2.1 million for the quarter ended October 2, 2015, primarily attributable to fluctuations in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar for the periods presented, net of the impact from our hedging activity and a gain on
available-for-sale securities recognized during the quarter ended October 2, 2015.      Provision for Income Taxes    
 We recorded an income tax provision of $76.7 million and $10.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015,
respectively.    The income tax provision for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $33.0 million for income and withholding
taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations, $0.3 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions, and a discrete expense of $310.8 million relating to a change in our
prior years  indefinite reinvestment assertion, partially offset by a discrete benefit of $267.4 million for a release in our U.S. federal valuation allowance.  
 The income tax provision for the quarter ended October 2, 2015 consisted of $8.8 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our
foreign and domestic operations and $1.8 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions, partially offset by the reversal of $0.4 million for reserves and interest for uncertain
tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during the quarter ended October 2, 2015.  
 Our effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was 87.9%, which differs from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of
35% principally due to the discrete items recorded during the quarter related to the reversal of the prior years  indefinite reinvestment assertion and release of the U.S. federal valuation allowance. We continue to maintain a valuation
allowance on part of our foreign tax credit carryforwards and a full valuation allowance on our capital loss carryforwards, U.S. state deferred tax assets and substantially all of our Japan-related deferred tax assets. See Note 13,  Income
Taxes  for additional information. The reversal of the prior years  indefinite reinvestment assertion and release of the U.S. federal valuation allowance did not have an effect on our cash taxes. As of December 31, 2015, the valuation
allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets was approximately $330.4 million.    We have not made an indefinite reinvestment assertion
related to current year foreign earnings. We expect our future effective tax rate to more approximate the U.S. statutory federal rate of 35%. The effect of the increase in the future rate is not anticipated to have an effect on our
cash taxes until all of our U.S. federal net operating losses and credits have been utilized.

   Results of Operations   
   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended October 2, 2015    
 The following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our unaudited consolidated
financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 (in millions):      
     Revenues    
 Revenues were $2,645.9 million and $2,655.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively,
representing a decrease of $9.6 million, or approximately 0.4%. The decrease primarily resulted from a decline in average selling prices of approximately 11% for all segments combined, partially offset by higher sales volume and by Fairchild revenue
of $53.1 million between September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016 in our Power Solutions and Analog Solutions Groups.    Revenues by
reportable segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 were as follows (dollars in millions):      
        (1)  Certain amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts.

  Revenues from the Analog Solutions Group decreased by $10.9 million, or approximately 1.1%, for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended October 2, 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to a $22.2 million, or approximately 10.1%, decrease in revenue from our LSI products and a $5.9 million,
or approximately 35.4%, decrease in revenue from our foundry products, offset by the acquisition of Fairchild, which had revenues of $17.8 million attributable to this segment between September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016.  
 Revenues from the Image Sensor Group decreased by $11.5 million, or approximately 2.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the nine months ended October 2, 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to a $31.6 million, or approximately 6.9%, decrease in revenues from our CMOS Image Sensor products, partially offset by a $7.2 million, or approximately 9.7%,
increase in revenues from our ASIC products and a $12.9 million, or approximately 54.1%, increase in revenues from our LSI products.  
 Revenues from the Power Solutions Group increased by $12.8 million, or approximately 1.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the nine months ended October 2, 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Fairchild, which had $35.3 million in revenues attributable to this segment between September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016,
offset by a $7.3 million, or approximately 9.7%, decrease in revenues from our discrete products and a $7.3 million, or approximately 9.3%, decrease in revenues from our IPM products.  
 Revenues by geographic location, including local sales made by operations within each area, based on sales billed from the respective country,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 were as follows (dollars in millions):      
        (1)  Certain amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts.    A majority of
our end customers, served directly or through distribution channels, are manufacturers of electronic devices. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, we had no single customer that accounted for 10% or more of our
total revenues.      Gross Profit and Gross Margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below)    
 Our gross profit by reportable segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 was as follows (dollars in
millions):      
    (1)  Certain amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts.

Table of Contents  

  Our gross profit was $912.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
$913.3 million during the nine months ended October 2, 2015. The gross profit decrease of $0.9 million, or approximately 0%, is primarily due to expensing of the fair market value of inventory step-up from the Fairchild acquisition, a decrease
in gross profit in our Analog Solutions Group, and a decline in average selling prices of approximately 11%, partially offset by higher gross profit in the Power Solutions Group due to higher sales volume, by Fairchild s gross profit between
September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016 of $11.5 million and by improved performance in our Image Sensor Group due to favorable product mix.  
 Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to approximately 34.5% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately
34.4% during the nine months ended October 2, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by offsetting changes in volume and mix across certain product lines.  
   Operating Expenses      Research and
development expenses were $312.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $305.7 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2015, representing an increase of $6.8 million, or approximately 2%. This increase is
primarily associated with higher payroll expenses, including incentive compensation and payroll related costs. Fairchild s research and development expenses between September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016 were $3.1 million and were
primarily payroll related costs.    Selling and marketing expenses were $158.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to $156.0 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2015, representing an increase of $2.6 million, or approximately 2%. This increase is primarily associated with higher payroll expenses, including incentive compensation and payroll related
costs, offset by lower advertising expenses. Fairchild s selling and marketing expenses between September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016 were $3.5 million and were primarily payroll related costs.  
 General and administrative expenses were $158.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $136.6 million for the nine
months ended October 2, 2015, representing an increase of $21.5 million, or approximately 16%. This increase is primarily associated with higher payroll expenses, including incentive compensation and payroll related costs, as well as $22.3
million of acquisition-related expenses incurred during the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by a decrease in travel expenses. Fairchild s general and administrative expenses between September 19, 2016 and September 30, 2016 were
$3.1 million and were primarily payroll related costs.      Other Operating Expenses    
  Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets   
 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $71.9 million and $101.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
October 2, 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of $29.2 million, or approximately 28.9%. The decrease in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is attributable to the declining amortization of our Aptina and
Truesense intangible assets, offset partially by the amortization from our intangible assets acquired from the Fairchild acquisition. See Note 3:  Acquisitions and Divestitures  and Note 4:  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  of the
notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information. Amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Fairchild Transaction was $1.6 million between September 19, 2016 and
September 30, 2016.     Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other, Net   
 Restructuring, asset impairments and other, net was $28.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.5 million for
the nine months ended October 2, 2015. The information below summarizes certain activities for each respective period. See Note 5:  Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other, Net  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information.     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded approximately $28.7 million of net charges related to our restructuring programs,
consisting primarily of employee separation charges from our workforce reduction and manufacturing relocation programs.  
      46  

Table of Contents  

   Nine Months Ended October 2, 2015   
 During the nine months ended October 2, 2015, we recorded approximately $6.4 million of net charges related to our restructuring programs,
consisting primarily of $3.5 million of employee separation charges from our European marketing organization relocation plan and $1.2 million of general workforce reductions. Total restructuring, asset impairments and other, net, was partially
offset by a $3.4 million gain from the sale of assets and the change in foreign currency for our KSS facility.     Intangible Asset Impairment   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, the Company canceled certain of its previously capitalized IPRD
projects and recorded a related impairment loss of $2.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively, included in the  Intangible asset impairment  caption on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
   See Note 4:  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
in this Form 10-Q for additional information.      Interest Expense    
 Interest expense increased by $69.6 million to $104.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $34.8 million during
the nine months ended October 2, 2015 as a result of borrowings under the Term Loan  B  Facility. Our average gross long-term debt balance (including current maturities) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,673.6 million at
a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 5.2%, compared to $1,364.5 million at a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 3.4% for the nine months ended October 2, 2015.  
   Loss on Modification or Extinguishment of Debt    
 Loss on modification or extinguishment of debt increased by $6.3 million to $6.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to zero during the nine months ended October 2, 2015, due to the execution of the First Amendment, which resulted in a debt extinguishment charge of $4.7 million, and the termination and replacement of our senior revolving credit
facility by the Revolving Credit Facility, which resulted in a debt modification and write-off of $1.6 million in unamortized debt issuance costs. See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  for further information.  
   Gain on Divestiture of Business    
 Gain on divestiture of business increased by $92.2 million to $92.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
zero during the nine months ended October 2, 2015. On August 29, 2016, the Company sold two lines of business for $104.0 million in cash. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a gain of $92.2 million after, among other
things, transferring inventory of $4.1 million to Littelfuse, writing off goodwill of $3.4 million, and deferring $4.3 million of the proceeds to be recognized in the future. See Note 3:  Acquisitions and Divestitures  for further
information.      Other      Other
income decreased by $11.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to an expense of $3.3 million from income of $7.9 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the gain on sale of
available-for-sale securities, fluctuations in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar for the periods presented, net of the impact from our hedging activity, and the decrease in fair value of our contingent consideration for the acquisition
of AXSEM.      Provision for Income Taxes    
 We recorded an income tax provision of $89.6 million and $25.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015,
respectively.  
      47  

Table of Contents  

  The income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $45.2 million
for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations, $2.9 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions and a discrete expense of $310.8 million
relating to a change in our prior years  indefinite reinvestment assertion, partially offset by a discrete benefit of $267.4 million for a release in our U.S. federal valuation allowance and by the reversal of $1.9 million for reserves and
interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed.    The
income tax provision for the nine months ended October 2, 2015 consisted primarily of $24.7 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations and $2.6 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves
for uncertain prior year tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions, partially offset by the reversal of $1.9 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for
which the statute lapsed during the nine months ended October 2, 2015.    Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 was 55.2%, which differs from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 35% principally due to the discrete items related to the reversal of the prior years  indefinite reinvestment assertion and release of the U.S. federal valuation
allowance. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance on part of our foreign tax credit carryforwards and a full valuation allowance on our capital loss carryforwards, U.S. state deferred tax assets and substantially all of our Japan-related
deferred tax assets. See Note 13,  Income Taxes  for additional information. The reversal of the prior years  indefinite reinvestment assertion and release of the U.S. federal valuation allowance did not have an effect on our cash
taxes. As of December 31, 2015, the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets was approximately $330.4 million.    We
have not made an indefinite reinvestment assertion related to current year foreign earnings. We expect our future effective tax rate to more approximate the U.S. statutory federal rate of 35%. The effect of the increase in the future rate
is not anticipated to have an effect on our cash taxes until all of our U.S. federal net operating losses and credits have been utilized.     Liquidity
and Capital Resources     This section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements, off-balance sheet arrangements,
contingencies, sources and uses of cash, operations, working capital, and long-term assets and liabilities.      Contractual Obligations    
 Our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our long-term debt, capital leases, operating leases and purchase obligations. The
following table summarizes our contractual obligations at September 30, 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future (in millions):  
   
    (1)  The table above excludes approximately $23.0 million
of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement of such liabilities.  
  (2)  Includes interest payments at applicable rates as of September 30, 2016.  
  (3)  These represent our off-balance sheet arrangements (see  Liquidity and Capital
Resources Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  for a description of our off-balance sheet arrangements).  
      48

  This table also excludes our pension obligations. We expect to make cash contributions and future
pension payments to comply with local funding requirements of approximately $3.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2016. This future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements. The
timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. Beyond 2016, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying
asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. See Note 11:  Employee Benefit Plans  of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 5 of
the 2015 Form 10-K for more information on our pension obligations.    The contractual obligations table above has been updated to
reflect the increased contractual obligations as a result of the Fairchild acquisition. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition, there were material changes to our obligations, interest expense and fees associated with the debt we incurred
in connection with the Fairchild Transaction. See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for a discussion of debt we incurred in connection with the
closing of the Fairchild Transaction. For other information on long-term debt, see Note 7:  Long-Term Debt,  for operating leases and financing activities (including certain information with respect to our Revolving Credit Facility),
see Note 10:  Commitments and Contingencies  and for pension plan information, see Note 6:  Balance Sheet Information  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.  
 Our balance of cash and cash equivalents was $880.5 million as of September 30, 2016. We believe that our cash flows from operations,
coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. Total cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 include approximately $326.6 million
available within the United States. While we hold a significant amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries, we have the ability to obtain cash in the United States through
distributions from our foreign subsidiaries in order to cover our domestic needs, by utilizing existing credit facilities, or through new bank loans or debt obligations.  
 We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, the repurchase of common stock, debt repurchases,
payments and acquisitions.    See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt,  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for information with respect to our long-term debt, including a discussion of debt we have incurred in connection with the closing of the Fairchild Transaction.  
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment, including our mainframe computer system,
desktop computers, communications, foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment.    In the normal course of business,
we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us, as required for transactions including, but not limited to: material purchase commitments, agreements to mitigate
collection risk, leases, utilities or customs guarantees. As of September 30, 2016, our Revolving Credit Facility included a $15.0 million availability for the issuance of letters of credit. There were no letters of credit outstanding under our
Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016. We also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our Revolving Credit Facility of $7.3 million as of September 30, 2016.  
 As part of securing financing in the normal course of business, we issued guarantees related to certain of our capital lease obligations,
equipment financing, lines of credit and real estate mortgages, which totaled $135.7 million as of September 30, 2016. We are also a guarantor of SCI LLC s non-collateralized loan with SMBC, which had a balance of $169.9 million as of
September 30, 2016. See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  and Note 10:  Commitments and Contingencies  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information.

  Based on historical experience and information currently available, we believe that we will not
be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements for the foreseeable future.    For our operating
leases, we expect to make cash payments and similarly incur expenses totaling $142.6 million as payments come due. We have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases, letters of credit and guarantee arrangements. See Note
10:  Commitments and Contingencies  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information.  
   Contingencies      We are a party to
a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements. Some of the
agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to IP infringement, property damage including environmental contamination, personal injury, failure to comply with applicable laws, our negligence or willful
misconduct, or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets.    We face risk of
exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in economic damage, bodily injury or property damage. In addition, if any
of our designed products are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in their recall. Depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors, we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such
customer for valid defective product claims.    We and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors, officers and other persons
in accordance with limited liability agreements, certificates of incorporation, by-laws, articles of association or similar organizational documents, as the case may be. We maintain directors  and officers  insurance, which should enable
us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. On February 19, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a form of indemnification agreement (the  Indemnification Agreement ) and authorized us to enter into an indemnification
agreement in substantially the form of the Indemnification Agreement with each of our directors and executive officers (each, an  Indemnitee ). The Indemnification Agreement clarifies and supplements the indemnification rights and
obligations of the Indemnitee and us already included in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Under the terms of the Indemnification Agreement, subject to certain exceptions specified in the Indemnification Agreement, we will indemnify the
Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law in the event the Indemnitee becomes subject to or a participant in certain claims or proceedings as a result of the Indemnitee s service as a director or officer. We will also,
subject to certain exceptions and repayment conditions, advance to the Indemnitee specified indemnifiable expenses incurred in connection with such claims or proceedings.  
 The Fairchild Agreement provides for indemnification and insurance rights in favor of Fairchild s then current and former directors,
officers and employees. Specifically, the Company has agreed that, for no fewer than six years following the Fairchild acquisition, (a) it will indemnify and hold harmless each such indemnitee against losses and expenses (including advancement
of attorneys  fees and expenses) in connection with any proceeding asserted against the indemnified party in connection with such person s servings as a director, officer, employee or other fiduciary of Fairchild or its subsidiaries prior
to the effective time of the acquisition, (b) it will maintain in effect all provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Fairchild or any of its subsidiaries or any other agreements of Fairchild or any of its subsidiaries with
any indemnified party regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses in existence on the date of the Fairchild Agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective
time of the acquisition and (c) subject to certain qualifications, it will provide to Fairchild s then current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the
effective time of the acquisition that is no less favorable than Fairchild s then-existing policy, or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage.  
 While our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification, other agreements do not
contain such limitations, and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
agreement. Historically, payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to
pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.    See
Note 10:  Commitments and Contingencies  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements under the heading  Legal Matters  in this Form 10-Q for possible contingencies related to legal matters. See also Part I,
Item 1  Business Government Regulation  of our 2015 Form 10-K for information on certain environmental matters.

    Sources and Uses of Cash    
 We require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for research and development, capital
expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments, the repurchase of our stock and other Company securities, debt service, including principal and interest, and capital lease payments. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash
generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances. In the near term, we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand and short-term
investments. We also have the ability to utilize our Revolving Credit Facility.    As part of our business strategy, we review acquisition
and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis. See Note 3:  Acquisitions and Divestitures  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information on
recent acquisitions, including a discussion of the Fairchild Transaction.    We believe that the key factors that could affect our internal
and external sources of cash include:      

Factors that affect our results of operations and cash flows, including the impact on our business and
operations as a result of changes in demand for our products, competitive pricing pressures, effective management of our manufacturing capacity, our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses, the impact of our restructuring
programs on our production and cost efficiency and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business; and     

Factors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our
ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise, including interest rate fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, sudden reductions in the general availability of lending
from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time.     
 Our ability to service our long-term debt, including our 1.00% Notes, 2.625% Notes, Series B, and Term Loan  B  Facility, to remain
in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital, capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to
our future operating performance, as well as to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control.  
 If we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations, we may need to borrow additional funds or raise additional equity to achieve our
longer term objectives. There can be no assurance that such borrowings or equity will be available or, if available, will be at rates or prices acceptable to us. We believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments and existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next twelve months,
including the payment of debt maturing in 2016. To the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans, our liquidity may be adversely impacted.  
 During the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our cash requirements and, if necessary, adjust our expenditures for inventory, operating
expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand. Our capital expenditures are primarily directed toward production equipment and capacity expansion. Our capital expenditure levels can
materially influence our available cash for other initiatives. For example, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid $160.8 million for capital expenditures, while during the nine months ended October 2, 2015, we paid $204.8 million
for capital expenditures. Our current minimum capital expenditure contractual commitment for the remainder of 2016 is approximately $39.0 million. Our current minimum contractual capital expenditure commitment for 2017 and thereafter is
approximately $28.0 million. Our capital expenditures have historically been approximately 6% to 7% of annual revenues, and we expect to continue to incur capital expenditures to support our business activities. Future capital expenditures may be
impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted.    On April 15, 2016, we entered into two new financing arrangements
to secure funds for the purchase consideration of Fairchild among certain other items, including a $2.2 billion Term Loan  B  Facility, with the proceeds deposited into escrow accounts and used to finance the transaction, which occurred on
September 19, 2016. On September 30, 2016, we amended the financing arrangements and increased the Term Loan  B  Facility by $200 million. The associated interest expense related to our Term Loan  B  Facility had, and
will continue to have, a material impact to our results of operations throughout the term of the Amended Credit Agreement. See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this Form 10-Q for additional information.

    Primary Cash Flow Sources    
 Our long-term cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash. Our cash flows from operations is summarized as
follows (in millions):      
   Our cash flows provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by
$38.4 million compared to the nine months ended October 2, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to the change in working capital during the period.  
 Our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on, among other factors, our success in achieving our revenue goals and
manufacturing and operating cost targets.    Our management of our assets and liabilities, including both working capital and long-term
assets and liabilities, also influences our operating cash flows and each of these components is discussed below.      Working Capital    
 Working capital, calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities, fluctuates depending on end-market demand and our
effective management of certain items such as receivables, inventory and payables. In times of escalating demand, our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production. Our working
capital may also be affected by restructuring programs, which may require us to use cash for severance payments, asset transfers and contract termination costs. In addition, our working capital may be affected by acquisitions, capital activities as
part of our share repurchase program and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments. Our working capital, excluding cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, was $424.0 million at September 30, 2016 and has
fluctuated between $33.9 million and $424.0 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters. Our working capital, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, was $1,304.5 million at September 30, 2016 and has
fluctuated between $611.8 million and $1,304.5 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters. Although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances, these investments are necessary to support business and
operating initiatives. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our working capital was most significantly impacted by our capital expenditures, our repayment of long-term debt, including capital leases and our acquisition of Fairchild. See
Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information.

Table of Contents  

  Working capital as of September 30, 2016 includes the prospective adoption of ASU 2015-17.
Periods prior to December 31, 2015 have not been adjusted for the adoption of ASU 2015-17. See Note 2:  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form
10-Q for additional information.      Long-Term Assets and Liabilities    
 Our long-term assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.  
 Our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more
efficiently. We believe that near-term access to additional manufacturing capacity, should it be required, could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties. We will continue to look for opportunities
to make future strategic purchases for additional capacity.    Our long-term liabilities, excluding long-term debt and deferred taxes,
consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves. In regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans, generally, our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally
required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate. This annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions.     Key Financing and
Capital Events       Overview    
 For the past several years, we have undertaken measures to repurchase shares of our common stock, reduce interest costs, amend existing key
financing arrangements and, in some cases, extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility. Set forth below is a summary of certain key financing events affecting our capital structure. For further
information with respect to our debt instruments, see Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.  
   Fairchild Transaction Financing    
 On April 15, 2016, we entered into (i) a $600 million senior revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility )
and (ii) a $2.2 billion term loan  B  facility (the  Term Loan  B  Facility ), the terms of which are set forth in a Credit Agreement (the  New Credit Agreement ), dated as of April 15, 2016, by and
among the Company, as borrower, the several lenders party thereto, Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent (the  Agent ), and certain other parties, and (2) a Guarantee and Collateral Agreement
(the  Guarantee and Collateral Agreement ) with certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the  Guarantors ), pursuant to which the New Credit Agreement was guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by a pledge of substantially all of
the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, including a pledge of the equity interests in certain of the Company s domestic and first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions. The obligations under the New Credit Agreement
are also secured by mortgages on certain real property assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries. Subject to the terms and conditions of the New Credit Agreement, on April 15, 2016, we borrowed an aggregate of $2.2 billion under the
Term Loan  B  Facility (the  Gross Proceeds ).    On April 15, 2016, the Gross Proceeds, along with certain other
amounts funded by the Company, were deposited into escrow accounts pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement and, upon release from escrow, in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement, were available primarily to pay, directly or
indirectly, the purchase price of the Fairchild Transaction pursuant to the terms of the Fairchild Agreement and certain other items, subject to the terms and conditions of the New Credit Agreement.  
 On September 19, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition and acquired 100% of Fairchild, whereby Fairchild became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. The Company funded the acquisition with the Term Loan  B  Facility proceeds and Company funded amounts previously deposited into escrow accounts, proceeds from a $200.0 million draw against the
Company s Revolving Credit Facility, and existing cash on hand. Proceeds from the Term Loan  B  Facility were also used to pay for debt issuance costs, transaction fees and expenses. 
      53  

Table of Contents  

  On September 30, 2016, the Company, entered into the first amendment (the  First
Amendment ) to the New Credit Agreement (the  Amended Credit Agreement ). The First Amendment reduced the applicable margins on Eurocurrency Loans to 2.75% and 3.25% for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the
Term Loan  B  Facility, respectively and reduced applicable margins ABR Loans to 1.75% and 2.25% for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan  B  Facility, respectively. Additionally, the First
Amendment included the following: (i) the Term Loan  B  Facility was increased to $2.4 billion, (ii) certain restructuring transactions and intercompany intellectual property transfers are permitted in order to achieve efficient
integration of the Company, its subsidiaries and acquired entities; and (iii) certain changes were made to the provisions regarding hedge agreements to allow the Company and each of the guarantors to enter into certain hedge arrangements. The
Company used the additional $200.0 million proceeds under the Term Loan  B  Facility to pay off the Company s $200.0 million outstanding balance under the Company s Revolving Credit Facility.  
 See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q
for additional information.      Cash Management    
 Our ability to manage cash is limited, as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements,
contractual obligations, debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements. While we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases, we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain
our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms for new products.      Debt Guarantees and Related Covenants    
 As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the indentures relating to our 1.00% Notes and our 2.625% Notes, Series B and with
covenants relating to our Term Loan  B  Facility, Revolving Credit Facility and various other debt agreements. Our 1.00% Notes are senior to the existing and future subordinated indebtedness of ON Semiconductor Corporation and its
guarantor subsidiaries. Our 2.625% Notes, Series B are subordinated to the senior indebtedness of ON Semiconductor Corporation and its guarantor subsidiaries. See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  for a description of our Fairchild Transaction
financing.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2:  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  of the notes to our unaudited
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.        Item
3.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk      We are exposed to
financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading
purposes.    As of September 30, 2016, our gross long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled $3,831.3 million. We have no
interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $1,103.6 million as of September 30, 2016. We do have interest rate exposure with respect to the $2,727.7 million balance of our variable interest rate debt
outstanding as of September 30, 2016. A 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately $13.6 million. However, some of this impact would be offset by
additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase.    Except as described
above, our exposure to market risk from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 has not changed materially from the information provided in our 2015 Form 10-K. Information on our exposure to market risk includes our Fairchild Transaction
financing, which increases our floating rate interest exposure. See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information.  
 To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions, we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward
positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures, from an accounting and economic perspective. However, given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures
intended to be hedged, we cannot provide any assurances that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.  
      54  

Table of Contents  

  We are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other
than our functional currencies, as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the U.S. dollar as a normal part of the reporting process. Our Japanese operations utilize Japanese Yen as the functional currency,
which results in the Company recording a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.  
 We enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain
recorded assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. Changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in fair value of the assets or liabilities being
hedged. The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $102.6 million and $89.8 million, respectively. Our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments, trading in currencies for
which there are no underlying exposures, or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.  
 Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital
purchases are transacted in local currencies, including Japanese Yen, Euros, Malaysian Ringgit, Philippines Peso, Korean Won, Chinese Renminbi, Czech Koruna, and Vietnamese Dong. Due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies,
our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the U.S. dollar. For example, we determined that based on a hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates, our results would have impacted our
income before taxes by approximately $46.4 million as of September 
30, 2016, assuming no offsetting hedge positions or correlated activities.        Item 4.      
  Controls and Procedures       Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
 We also carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016.  
 On September 19, 2016, we acquired Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc., which operated under its own set of systems and internal
controls. We are separately maintaining Fairchild s systems and much of its control environment until we are able to incorporate Fairchild s processes into our own systems and control environment. We currently expect to complete the
integration of Fairchild s operations into our systems and control environment by the fourth quarter of 2017.    Other than as
described above, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 which have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

     Item 1A. Risk Factors    
 Except as described below, there have been no material changes in our assessment of our risk factors included in our 2015 Form 10-K. This Form
10-Q includes  forward-looking statements,  as that term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or
incorporated in this Form 10-Q could be deemed forward-looking statements, particularly statements about our plans, strategies and prospects under the heading  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.  Forward-looking statements are often characterized by the use of words such as  believes,   estimates,   expects,   projects,   may,   will,   intends, 
 plans,  or  anticipates,  or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. All forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q are made based on our current expectations, forecasts, estimates and assumptions, and involve risks,
uncertainties and other factors that could cause results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Among these factors are our revenues and operating performance; economic conditions and markets
(including current financial conditions); effects of exchange rate fluctuations; the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry; changes in demand for our products, changes in inventories at our customers and distributors, technological and
product development risks; enforcement and protection of our IP rights and related risks; risks related to the security of our information systems and secured network; availability of raw materials, electricity, gas, water and other supply chain
uncertainties; our ability to effectively shift production to other facilities when required in order to maintain supply continuity for our customers; variable demand and the aggressive pricing environment for semiconductor products; our ability to
successfully manufacture in increasing volumes on a cost-effective basis and with acceptable quality for our current products; legislative, regulatory and economic developments; competitor actions, including the adverse impact of competitor product
announcements; pricing and gross profit pressures; loss of key customers; order cancellations or reduced bookings; changes in manufacturing yields; control of costs and expenses and realization of cost savings and synergies from restructurings;
significant litigation; risks associated with decisions to expend cash reserves for various uses in accordance with our capital allocation policy such as debt prepayment, stock repurchases, or acquisitions rather than to retain such cash for future
needs; risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions (including from integrating and consolidating and timely filing financial information with the SEC for acquired businesses and difficulties encountered in accurately predicting the future
financial performance of acquired businesses); risks associated with our substantial leverage and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements that may be in place from time to time; risks associated with our worldwide operations, including foreign
employment and labor matters associated with unions and collective bargaining arrangements, as well as man-made and/or natural disasters affecting our operations and finances/financials; the threat or occurrence of international armed conflict and
terrorist activities both in the United States and internationally; risks and costs associated with increased and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards; risks related to new legal requirements, including laws, rules and
regulations related to taxes; risks involving environmental or other governmental regulation; and risks associated with our recent acquisition of Fairchild, including: (1) IP litigation matters relating to Fairchild and litigation challenging the
transaction; (2) our ability to retain key personnel; (3) competitive responses to the transaction; (4) unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the transaction; (5) adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from
the transaction; (6) our ability to realize the benefits of the acquisition of Fairchild; (7) delays, challenges and expenses associated with integrating the businesses; and (8) our ability to comply with the terms of the indebtedness incurred in
connection with the transaction. Additional factors that could affect our future results or events are described under Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors  in our 2015 Form 10-K, and from time to time in our other SEC reports. You should
carefully consider the trends, risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-Q, the 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of these
trends, risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your
investment. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update such information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons
acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. The following risk factors are in addition to those included in our 2015 Form 10-K.

    Indebtedness incurred in connection with the Fairchild Transaction could materially and
adversely affect us by, among other things, limiting our ability to conduct our operations and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions.    
 In connection with our acquisition of Fairchild, we entered into the Amended Credit Agreement providing for the $600 million Revolving Credit
Facility, which provides liquidity to us, and the $2.4 billion Term Loan  B  Facility, which was used to fund the acquisition of Fairchild. See Note 7:  Long-Term Debt  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Fairchild Transaction.  
 The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the personal property and material
real property assets of the Company and most of the Company s domestic subsidiaries. As a result, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, the lenders could take possession of and foreclose on the
pledged collateral securing the indebtedness, in which case we would be at risk of losing the related collateral, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In addition, subject to customary exceptions, the Amended
Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances, which may result in prepaying outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan  B  Facility rather than using funds for other business
purposes.    Our acquisition-related financing, or other substantial indebtedness we may incur in the future, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, including, among other things, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes, will limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in
our long-term best interests, and could reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. Our level of indebtedness may also place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors. See  Risk
Factors- Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Relating to Our Indebtedness  in our 2015 Form 10-K for risks associated with our current and future outstanding indebtedness.  
   The distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the United States may be subject to United States income taxes, thus
reducing our net income.      We hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the United States in various foreign
subsidiaries. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, debt repurchases and repayments, acquisitions, and stock repurchases. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations,
through borrowings under our current debt agreements or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current
tax laws, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

      Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
      Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities   
  Share Repurchase Program     We did not
repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.    Under the share
repurchase program we announced in December 2014 (the  2014 Share Repurchase Program ), we may repurchase up to $1.0 billion (exclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses) of our common stock over a period of four years from December
1, 2014, subject to certain contingencies. We may repurchase our common stock from time to time in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, including pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of
the Exchange Act, or by any combination of such methods or other methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory
requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations, other market and economic conditions. The 2014 Share Repurchase Program does not require us to purchase any particular amount of common stock and is subject to a variety of factors including the
Board s discretion.    As of September 30, 2016, approximately $628.2 million remained of the total authorized amount to purchase
common stock pursuant to the 2014 Share Repurchase Program. The Fairchild Transaction financing may limit our future activity under the 2014 Share Repurchase Program as the New Credit Agreement includes contractual limitations on share repurchases
until certain ratio tests are satisfied. See Note 8:  Earnings Per Share and Equity  of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for further information on the 2014 Share
