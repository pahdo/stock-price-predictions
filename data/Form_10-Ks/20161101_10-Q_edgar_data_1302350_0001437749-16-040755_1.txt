   1. Organization and Description of Business   
     
  JMP Group LLC, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ), is an independent investment banking and asset management firm headquartered in San Francisco, California. The Company conducts its brokerage business through JMP Securities LLC ( JMP Securities ), its asset management business through Harvest Capital Strategies LLC ( HCS ), HCAP Advisors LLC ( HCAP Advisors ), JMP Asset Management Inc. ( JMPAM ), JMP Realty I LLC ( JMP Realty ), and JMP Credit Advisors LLC ( JMPCA ), and certain principal investments through JMP Investment Holdings LLC ( JMP Investment Holdings ), JMP Realty Trust Inc., and JMPCA. The above entities, other than HCAP Advisors, are wholly-owned subsidiaries. JMP Securities is a U.S. registered broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( the Exchange Act ), and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ). JMP Securities operates as an introducing broker and does not hold funds or securities for, or owe any money or securities to customers and does not carry accounts for customers. All customer transactions are cleared through another broker-dealer on a fully disclosed basis. HCS is a registered investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and provides investment management services for sophisticated investors in investment partnerships and other entities managed by HCS. HCAP Advisors provides investment advisory services to Harvest Capital Credit Corporation ( HCC ). JMP Realty manages JMP Realty Partners I LLC ( JMPRP ), a fund formed in the third quarter of 2016 to invest in real estate portfolios. Through JMPCA, the Company manages JMPCA CLO I Ltd ( CLO I ), JMPCA CLO II Ltd ( CLO II ), JMPCA CLO III Ltd ( CLO III ), and JMP Credit Advisors TRS Ltd ( JMPCA TRS ), a wholly owned special purpose vehicle formed to enter into a total return swap ( TRS ). The Company completed a Reorganization Transaction in January 2015 pursuant to which JMP Group Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of JMP Group LLC (the  Reorganization Transaction ).  
     
   Recent Transactions   
     
  On September 27, 2016, the Company repurchased $12.8 million face value of the unsecured subordinated notes from CLO III non-controlling interests, increasing the Company s ownership of unsecured subordinated notes from 13.5% to 46.7%. The effects of changes on the Company s equity from net income attributable to JMP Group LLC and the purchase of CLO III non-controlling interest are noted below.  

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
     
   Basis of Presentation   
     
  These consolidated financial statements and related notes are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  Annual Report ). These consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year.  
     
  The consolidated accounts of the Company include the wholly-owned subsidiaries, JMP Securities, HCS, JMPCA, JMP Investment Holdings, JMPCA TRS (effective May 2015), JMP Asset Management Inc. (effective October 2015), JMP Realty Trust Inc. (effective September 2015), and the partially-owned subsidiaries CLO I, CLO II, CLO III and HCAP Advisors. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Non-controlling interest on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 relate to the interest of third parties in the partially-owned subsidiaries.

3. Recent Accounting Pronouncemen  ts   
     
  Accounting Standards Updates ( ASU ) 2014-09, ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ,    were issued in May 2014, August 2015, April 2016 and May 2016, respectively, to provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues. The provisions of these standards are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and do not allow early adoption. ASU 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations , was issued in March 2016 to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. Its adoption may have an impact on the Company s financial statements; however, the extent is not yet determined.  
     
  ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15,  Interest-Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , were issued April 2015 and August 2015, respectively. To simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs, the amendments in 2015-03 require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-15 extends the scope of ASU 2015-03 to address debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements. This standard became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Upon adoption, the Company reclassified debt issuance costs to the respective debt liability line items.   
     
  ASU 2016-02,  Leases , was issued February 2016 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing information about leasing arrangements. The standard requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities arising from operational leases on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Upon adoption, the Company s assets and liabilities will be grossed up to reflect the present value of the lease payments; however, the extent is not yet determined.   
     
  ASU 2016-06,  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments , was issued in March 2016 to clarify and improve GAAP by eliminating diversity in assessing embedded contingent call options in debt instruments. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Its adoption may have an impact on the Company s financial statements; however, the extent is not yet determined.  
     
  ASU 2016-07,  Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting , was issued in March 2016. When an investment qualifies for the use of the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, the amendments eliminate the requirement to retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.   
     
  ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , was issued in March 2016 as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. Areas for simplification in this update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.  
     
  ASU 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,  was issued in June 2016 to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This standard will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 may result in more immediate recognition of losses on the Company s amortized cost investments.   
     
  ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ,  was issued in August 2016 to address diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This standard addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.     The amendments in this standard are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments will be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues will be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 is expected to result in reclassifications within the Company s statements of cash flows.

4. Fair Value Measurements   
     
  The following tables provide fair value information related to the Company s financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

(1)   
 
   In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the statement of financial position.      

- 12 -

Recurring Fair Value Measurement   
     
  The following tables provide information related to the Company s assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:     

(1)   
 
  In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the statement of financial position.     
     
  The Company s Level 2 assets held in other investments consist of investments in hedge funds managed by HCS. The carrying value of investment in hedge funds is calculated using the equity method and approximates fair value. Earnings or losses attributable to these investments are recorded in principal transactions. These assets are considered Level 2 as the underlying hedge funds are mainly invested in publicly traded stocks whose value is based on quoted market prices. The Company s proportionate share of those investments is included in the tables above.   
     
      The investments in private equity funds managed by HCS and JMPAM are recognized using the fair value option. The Company uses the reported net asset value per share as a practical expedient to estimate the fair value of the funds. The risks associated with these investments are limited to the amounts of invested capital, remaining capital commitment and any management and incentive fees receivable. The Company uses the reported net asset value per share as a practical expedient to estimate the fair value of HGC, HGC II and JMPRP.  
     
  The Company holds a limited partner investment in a private equity fund, managed by a third party. This fund aims to achieve medium to long-term capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of technology companies that leverage the growth of Greater China. The Company also holds investments in real estate funds, which aim to generate revenue streams from investments in real estate joint ventures. The Company recognizes these investments using the fair value option. The primary reason for electing the fair value option was to measure gains on the same basis as the Company s other equity securities, which are stated at fair value. The Company uses the reported net asset value per share as a practical expedient to estimate the fair value of the funds. The investments in private investment funds managed by third parties are generally not redeemable at the option of the Company.    

- 13 -

As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, $6.9 million and $13.7 million of assets were measured using the net asset value as a practical expedient. Investments for which fair value was estimated using net asset value as a practical expedient were as follows:  

(1) Investments in Funds of Funds managed by HCS began the process of liquidation on December 31, 2015.  
       
   Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements   
     
  The Company's assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis result from the application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. The Company held no assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis   at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Company held loans collateralizing asset-backed securities of $2.2 million, which were placed on non-accrual status. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded no related losses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded related losses of $0.7 million.   
     
   Loans Held for Investment   
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans held for investment included four loans. Given the small size of this loan portfolio segment, the Company reviews credit quality of the loans within this portfolio segment on a loan by loan basis mainly focusing on the borrower s financial position and results of operations as well as the current and expected future cash flows on the loan.  
     
  Effective July 1, 2013, the Company agreed to lend a health sciences fund investment advising company up to $2.0 million, at an interest rate of 10% per year. The outstanding principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on July 1, 2018. In the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company placed this loan on non-accrual status, and recorded a related reserve for $0.4 million. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s loan outstanding to this entity was $1.7 million, net of a $0.4 million reserve, and $2.1 million, respectively. The Company determined the fair value of loans held for investment to be $1.6 million and $2.3 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, using anticipated cash flows, discounted at an appropriate market credit adjusted interest rate.  
     
   Investments at Cost   and Equity Method   
     
  On February 11, 2010, the Company made a $1.5 million investment in Class D Preferred Units of Sanctuary Wealth Services LLC ( Sanctuary ), which provides a turnkey platform that allows independent wealth advisors to establish an independent advisory business without the high startup costs and regulatory hurdles. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company determined that its investment in Sanctuary was fully impaired and recorded an impairment loss of $1.5 million, which was included in Principal Transactions on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. On April 3, 2012, the Company purchased a $2.3 million receivable for $1.4 million from Sanctuary. The $1.4 million included $0.5 million in cash consideration and $0.9 million in connection with the partial redemption of the $1.5 million investment in Sanctuary. The Company recognized the $0.9 million as a gain in Principal Transactions, and the $2.3 million receivable in Other Assets. The carrying value of the settlement receivable was $0.1 million and $0.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company determined the fair value of the settlement receivable to be $0.1 million and $0.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, using anticipated cash flows, discounted at an appropriate market credit adjusted interest rate. Significant increases in the market credit adjusted interest rate in isolation would result in decreases to the fair value measurement.

Derivative Financial Instruments   
     
  In February 2015, the Company received a $0.7 million convertible promissory note in exchange for a partial redemption of outstanding Class D Preferred Units of Sanctuary. At the option of the holder, the convertible promissory note is convertible into Class A Units on a fully diluted basis. The Company recognized the $0.7 million as a gain in Principal Transactions, and the $0.7 million convertible promissory note in Other Investments. In determining the carrying value of the investment, the Company bifurcated the convertible option from the promissory note. The Company identified this convertible option as an embedded derivative. The promissory note is recognized at amortized cost. The convertible option is recognized using the fair value option. In determining the fair value of the option, the value of the underlying shares will be compared against the value of the promissory note. The carrying value of the investment was $0.7 million as of December 31, 2015. The Company recorded a $0.7 million loss against this investment in the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company recorded changes in the fair value of this investment as unrealized gain or loss in Principal Transactions. The Company determined the fair value of the investment to be zero as of September 30, 2016.  
       
  In the second quarter of 2015, JMPCA TRS entered into a TRS. The TRS effectively allows the Company to build up a portfolio of broadly syndicated loans with characteristics similar to the warehouse facility used to accumulate assets for JMPCA CLO III, Ltd.  The TRS differs from a traditional warehouse facility, in that the Company does not own or take title to the loans.  The TRS provides all the economic risks and rewards of owning the assets; however, they are only reference assets during the life of the investment. Under the TRS, JMPCA TRS pays interest on the value of the portfolio balance in exchange for any income or fees earned from a portfolio of syndicated loans held by the counter-party. The TRS has a tenor of 36 months with an 18 month revolving period and an 18 month amortization period. As of September 30, 2016, the TRS is held in Other Investments, with gains and losses recorded in Principal Transactions. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a $1.5 million and $2.1 million gain on the TRS, respectively. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized a $0.4 million loss and $0.1 million loss on the TRS, respectively. The Company determined the fair value of the TRS to be a $0.3 million asset and a $1.9 million liability as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, using the market value of the loans as provided by our counterparty. In association with this agreement, the Company posted $25.0 million as cash collateral, which is recorded in the line item Cash collateral posted for total return swap. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company posted an additional $0.2 million. The contract with the counter-party incorporates a master netting agreement. If the Company enters into another derivative with this counter-party, it could be offset with the TRS. The maximum exposure of the TRS is the $25.2 million posted as cash collateral plus any margin call amounts the Company may make in the future. The Company monitors the portfolio continuously, updating the collateral pricing and ratings daily. The facility has been under-levered as the max borrowings are $167.0 million and the Company s borrowing level remained between approximately $100.0 million and $110.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   5  . Loans Collateralizing Asset-backed Securities Issued   
     
  Loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued are commercial loans securitized and owned by the Company s CLOs. The loans consist of those loans within the CLO securitization structure at the acquisition date of CLO I and loans purchased by the CLOs subsequent to the CLO I acquisition date. The following table presents the components of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Loans recorded upon the acquisition of CLO I at fair value reflect a liquidity discount. The table below summarizes the activity in the loan principal, allowance for loan losses, liquidity discount, deferred loan fees, and the carrying value for the loans as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Impaired  ,     Non-Accru  al, Past Due and Restructured Loans   
     
  A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the original loan agreement, including scheduled principal and interest payments. As of December 31, 2015, the Company held no impaired loans collateralizing asset-backed securities. As of September 30, 2016, $2.9 million of recorded investment amount of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued were individually evaluated for impairment. The remaining $826.7 million and $975.1 million of recorded investment amount of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued were collectively evaluated for impairment, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company classified all its loans as Cash Flow loans, as their funding decisions were all primarily driven by the cash flows of the borrower. As of December 31, 2015, no loans were on non-accrual status. The table below presents certain information pertaining to the loans on non-accrual status at September 30, 2016:  

Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. No loans were past due at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any loans which were modified in a troubled debt restructuring.   
     
   Credit Quality of Loans   
     
  The Company, at least on a quarterly basis, reviews each loan and evaluates the credit quality of the loan. The review primarily includes the following credit quality indicators with regard to each loan: 1) Moody's rating, 2) current internal rating, 3) the trading price of the loan, and 4) performance of the obligor. The tables below present, by credit quality indicator, the Company's recorded investment in loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.     

(1)   
 
  Loans with an internal rating of 4 or below are reviewed individually to identify loans to be designated for non-accrual status.     
     
  The Company determined the fair value of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities to be $815.6 million and $940.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively; primarily using the average market bid and ask quotation obtained from a loan pricing service. Such loans are identified as Level 2 assets. The valuations are received from a pricing service to which the Company subscribes. The pricing service s analysis incorporates comparable loans traded in the marketplace, the obligor s industry, future business prospects, capital structure, and expected credit losses. Significant declines in the performance of the obligor would result in decreases to the fair value measurement.

6  .   Debt   
     
   Bond   Payable   
     
  In January 2013, JMP Group Inc. raised approximately $46.0 million from the sale of 8.00% Senior Notes (the  2013 Senior Notes ). In January 2014, JMP Group Inc. raised an additional approximate amount of $48.3 million from the sale of 7.25% Senior Notes (the  2014 Senior Notes ). The 2013 Senior Notes will mature on January 15, 2023 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at JMP Group Inc. s option on or after January 15, 2016, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The notes bear interest at a rate of 8.00% per year, payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. The 2014 Senior Notes will mature on January 15, 2021, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at JMP Group Inc. s option on or after January 15, 2017, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year, payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year.   
     
  The 2013 Senior Notes and 2014 Senior Notes (collectively, the  Senior Notes ) were issued pursuant to indentures with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The indentures contain a minimum liquidity covenant that obligates the JMP Group Inc. to maintain liquidity of at least an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate amount due on the next eight scheduled quarterly interest payments on the Senior Notes, or (ii) the aggregate amount due on all remaining scheduled quarterly interest payments on the Senior Notes until the maturity of the Senior Notes. The indenture also contains customary event of default and cure provisions. If an uncured default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Senior Notes may declare the Senior Notes immediately due and payable.  
     
  The Senior Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of JMP Group Inc. must rank equally with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and must be senior to any other indebtedness expressly made subordinate to the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness (to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness) and structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries, including trade payables.  
     
  JMP Group Inc., as a wholly owned subsidiary of JMP Group LLC, is the primary obligor of the Senior Notes. In conjunction with the Reorganization Transaction, on January 1, 2015, JMP Group LLC and JMP Investment Holdings LLC became guarantors of JMP Group Inc.   
     
  In February 2016, the Company purchased $0.5 million face value of the Senior Notes for $0.4 million. This purchase resulted in a $0.1 million gain, which is recognized in Other Income.   
     
  The Company incurred no additional debt issuance costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 relating to Senior Notes. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the estimated life of the bond. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held $2.1 million and $2.5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.    

Note Payable   and Lines of Credit   
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held revolving lines of credit related to JMP Holding LLC (formerly known as JMP Group LLC) and JMP Securities.   
     
  The Company s Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ), dated as of August 3, 2006, was entered by and between JMP Holding LLC and City National Bank ( CNB ), and was subsequently amended. The Credit Agreement and subsequent amendments provide a $25.0 million line of credit with a revolving period of two years through April 30, 2017. On such date, any outstanding amounts convert to a term loan. The term loan will be repaid in quarterly installments of 3.75% of funded debt for the first two years, 5.00% of funded debt for the next two years, and the remainder due at maturity. Proceeds for this line of credit will be used to make financial investments, for working capital purposes, for general corporate purposes, as well as a $5.0 million sublimit to issue letters of credit. The Company s outstanding balance on this line of credit was zero as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  JMP Securities holds a $20.0 million revolving line of credit with CNB to be used for regulatory capital purposes during its securities underwriting activities. The unused portion of the line bears interest at the rate of 0.25% per annum, paid monthly. The line of credit was scheduled to mature May 6, 2016, at which time any existing outstanding amount would convert to a term loan maturing the following year. On April 26, 2016, JMP Securities entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement (the  Amendment ). Pursuant to this Amendment, the $20.0 million line of credit was renewed for one year. On May 6, 2017, any existing outstanding amount will convert to a term loan maturing the following year. The remaining terms of this line of credit are consistent with those of the existing line of credit. There was no borrowing on this line of credit as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
  The Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on debt, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of certain financial covenants. A violation of any one of these covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement, which would permit CNB to terminate our note and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding principal and interest. At both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with the loan covenants. The revolving lines of credit are collateralized by a pledge of the Company s assets, including its interests in each of JMP Securities and HCS.

7  . Asset-backed Securities Issued   
     
   CLO I   
     
  On May 17, 2007, CLO I completed a $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes (the  Notes ) on-balance sheet debt securitization comprised of $455.0 million of secured debt and $45.0 million of unsecured, subordinated notes ( CLO equity ). The Notes will be repaid from the cash flows generated by the loan portfolio owned by CLO I. The Notes were issued in six separate classes as set forth in the table below. The Company owns approximately 94.0% of the unsecured subordinated notes and $13.8 million of Class C, D and E notes ($2.0 million of Class C, $4.1 million of Class D and $7.7 million of Class E notes). These unsecured subordinated notes and the Class C, D and E notes owned by the Company are eliminated upon consolidation of JMP Investment Holdings, and therefore, are not reflected on the Company s consolidated statement of financial condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

The secured notes and subordinated notes are limited recourse obligations payable solely from cash flows of the CLO I loan portfolio and related collection and payment accounts pledged as security. Payment on the Class A-1 notes rank equal, or pari-passu, in right of payment with payments on the Class A-2 notes and payment on the Class A-1 and Class A-2 notes rank senior in right of payment to the other secured notes and the subordinated notes. Payment on the Class B, Class C, Class D and Class E notes generally rank subordinate in right of payment to any other class of notes which has an earlier alphabetical designation. The subordinated notes are subordinated in right of payment to all other classes of notes and do not accrue interest. Interest on the secured notes is payable quarterly at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus the applicable spread set forth in the table above. Payment of interest on the Class C, Class D and Class E notes is payable only to the extent proceeds are available under the applicable payment priority provisions. To the extent proceeds are not so available, interest on the Class C, Class D and Class E notes will be deferred. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all interest on the secured notes was current. The secured notes are secured by the CLO loan portfolio and the funds on deposit in various related collection and payment accounts. The terms of the debt securitization subject the loans in the CLO loan portfolio to a number of collateral quality, portfolio profile, interest coverage and overcollateralization tests.   
     
  The reinvestment period for CLO I ended in May 2013. Since this date, all scheduled principal payments from the borrowers have been applied to paying down the most senior (AAA) CLO notes. The Company has been able to reinvest a portion of the unscheduled principal payments, which includes most loan payoffs, subject to certain restrictions.

The Secured Notes were issued in multiple tranches and are rated by Standard   Poor's Ratings Services. The Secured Notes are repaid from the cash flows generated by the loan portfolio owned by CLO II. The Company initially owned approximately 72.8% of the Subordinated Notes. In the first quarter of 2014, the Company repurchased $6.0 million of the Subordinated Notes from a third party investor in CLO II, increasing the Company s ownership from 72.8% to 98.0%. These Subordinated Notes were eliminated upon consolidation, and therefore, are not reflected on the Company s consolidated statement of financial condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

10. Net Income   (Loss)   per Common   Share   
     
  Basic net income (loss) per share for the Company is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of outstanding shares to reflect the potential dilutive impact as if all potentially dilutive share options or RSUs were exercised or converted under the treasury share method. However, for periods that the Company has a net loss the effect of outstanding share options or RSUs is anti-dilutive and, accordingly, is excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share.  
     
  The computations of basic and diluted net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are shown in the tables below:     

In the table above, unvested non-forfeitable RSUs that have distribution equivalent rights are treated as a separate class of securities in calculating net income per share. There was no impact of applying this methodology to the basic net income per share for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   
     
  Share options to purchase 2,667,283 and 3,524,068 common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were anti-dilutive and, therefore, were not included in the computation of diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Share options to purchase 2,720,985 and 2,120,327 common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were anti-dilutive and, therefore, were not included in the computation of diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.   
     
  No restricted share units were anti-dilutive for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Restricted share units for 1,955,873 common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were anti-dilutive and, therefore, were not included in the computation of diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. Restricted share units for 97,382 and 26,484 common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were anti-dilutive and, therefore, were not included in the computation of diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.   
     
   11  . Employee Benefits   
     
  All full-time employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the JMP Group 401(k) Plan after three months of employment. Participants may contribute up to the limits set by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Company contributes a match of 100% of each participant s contributions to the JMP Group 401(k) Plan up to a maximum of 3% of the participant s compensation plus 50% of the participant s elective deferrals between 3% and 5%. All participants are immediately vested 100% on matched contributions. The Company recorded JMP Group 401(k) Plan matching expense of $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company recorded JMP Group 401(k) Plan matching expense of $1.4 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
   12. Income Taxes   
     
  JMP Group LLC qualifies as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. The consolidated entities of the Company consist of wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries and entities treated as partnerships for U.S. income tax purposes. Income earned by the corporate subsidiaries is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxation. Income earned by the non-corporate subsidiaries is not subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income tax. These amounts are allocated to JMP Group LLCs  partners.  
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded income tax benefit of $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded income tax benefit of $0.8 million and income tax expense of $3.8 million, respectively. The effective tax rates were (10.3)% and 2.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rates were (14.8)% and 37.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

- 25 -

For financial reporting purposes, the Company s effective tax rate used for the interim periods is based on the estimated full-year income tax rate. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the following: (i) a substantial portion of the reported pre-tax income is attributable to non-controlling interests held in the Company s consolidated entities by third parties, and (ii) a significant portion of pre-tax income is from qualifying sources that is certain flow through entities within the company are not subject to entity level U.S. federal and state income taxes but rather flows to JMP Group LLC partners.  
     
  The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, and are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company s assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.   
     
   13  . Commitments and Contingencies   
     
  The Company leases office space in California, Illinois, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and Florida under various operating leases. Occupancy expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Occupancy expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The Company recorded sublease income of $0.1 million for both quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company recorded sublease income of $0.2 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The California, Illinois, Minnesota and New York leases included a period of free rent at the start of the lease. Rent expense is recognized over the entire lease period uniformly net of the free rent savings. The aggregate minimum future commitments of these leases are:  

In connection with its underwriting activities, JMP Securities enters into firm commitments for the purchase of securities in return for a fee. These commitments require JMP Securities to purchase securities at a specified price. Securities underwriting exposes JMP Securities to market and credit risk, primarily in the event that, for any reason, securities purchased by JMP Securities cannot be distributed at anticipated price levels. Settlement of transactions relating to such underwriting commitments, which were open at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.   
     
  The marketable securities owned and the restricted cash, as well as the cash held by the clearing broker, may be used to maintain margin requirements. The Company had $0.3 million of cash on deposit with JMP Securities  clearing broker at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Furthermore, the marketable securities owned may be hypothecated or borrowed by the clearing broker.  
     
  Unfunded commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower, provided that all conditions have been met. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had unfunded commitments of $52.7 million and $15.2 million, respectively, in the Corporate segment. $5.3 million and $2.2 million of the unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 relate to commitments traded but not yet closed in CLO I. $22.4 million and $5.0 million of the unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 relate to commitments traded but not yet closed in CLO II. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $22.2 million and $4.0 million of the unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2015 relate to commitments traded but not yet closed in CLO III. The Company determined the fair value of the unfunded commitments to be $52.9 million and $16.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, using the average market bid and ask quotation obtained from a loan pricing service.   
     
   14  . Regulatory Requirements   
     
  JMP Securities is subject to the SEC s Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, and requires that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital, both as defined, shall not exceed 15 to 1. JMP Securities had net capital of $29.1 million and $25.1 million, which were $28.1 million and $23.0 million in excess of the required net capital of $1.0 million and $2.1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. JMP Securities  ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was 0.52 to 1 and 1.25 to 1 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
     
  Since all customer transactions are cleared through another broker-dealer on a fully disclosed basis, JMP Securities is not required to maintain a separate bank account for the exclusive benefit of customers in accordance with Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act.

15  . Related Party Transactions   
     
  The Company earns base management fees and incentive fees from serving as investment advisor for various affiliated entities, including corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, and offshore investment companies. The Company also owns an investment in most of such affiliated entities. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate fair value of the Company s investments in the affiliated entities for which the Company serves as the investment advisor was $38.2 million and $51.1 million, respectively, which consisted of investments in hedge funds of $24.7 million and $38.6 million, respectively, investments in private equity funds of $4.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively, investments in funds of funds of $5 thousand and $19 thousand, respectively, and an investment in HCC common stock of $8.7 million and $8.4 million, respectively. Base management fees earned     from these affiliated entities were $4.2 million and $4.1 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Base management fees earned     from these affiliated entities were $12.4 million and $11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had management fees receivable from these affiliated entities of $1.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The Company incurred a negative adjustment to incentive fees of $0.1 million relating to the prior quarter and earned $2.8 million, from these affiliated entities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company earned incentive fees of $6.5 million and $5.1 million, from these affiliated entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had incentive fees receivable from these affiliated entities of $0.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively.  
     
  In September 2016, the Company sold investments to JMP Realty Partners I LLC., a fund managed by JMPAM. Refer to Note 4 for detail relating to the sale.   
     
   16  . Guarantees   
     
  JMP Securities has agreed to indemnify its clearing broker for losses that the clearing broker may sustain from the accounts of customers introduced by JMP Securities. Should a customer not fulfill its obligation on a transaction, JMP Securities may be required to buy or sell securities at prevailing market prices in the future on behalf of its customer. JMP Securities  obligation under the indemnification has no maximum amount. All unsettled trades at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 have subsequently settled with no resulting material liability to the Company. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no material loss due to counterparty failure, and has no obligations outstanding under the indemnification arrangement as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
  The Company is engaged in various investment banking and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include broker-dealers, banks and brokerage or investment banking clients. In the event counterparties do not fulfill their obligations, the Company may be exposed to risk. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument. It is the Company s policy to review, as necessary, the credit standing of each counterparty with which it conducts business.  
     
   17  . Litigation   
     
  The Company may be involved from time to time in a number of judicial, regulatory, litigation and arbitration matters arising in connection with our business. The outcome of such matters the Company has been and/or currently is involved in cannot be determined at this time, and the results cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future period and a significant outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   
     
  The Company reviews the need for any loss contingency reserves and establish reserves when, in the opinion of management, it is probable that a matter would result in liability and the amount of loss, if any, can be reasonably estimated. Generally, given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of matters the Company is involved in, particularly cases in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to reasonably estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the case is close to resolution. For these matters, no reserve is established until such time, other than for reasonably estimable legal fees and expenses. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, believes that the currently known actions or threats will not result in any material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  
     
   18  . Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk or Market Risk   
     
  The majority of the Company s transactions, and consequently the concentration of its credit exposure, is with its clearing broker. The clearing broker is also a significant source of short-term financing for the Company, which is collateralized by cash and securities owned by the Company and held by the clearing broker. The Company s securities owned may be pledged by the clearing broker. The receivable from the clearing broker represents amounts receivable in connection with the trading of proprietary positions.  
     
  The Company is also exposed to credit risk from other brokers, dealers and other financial institutions with which it transacts business. In the event that counterparties do not fulfill their obligations, the Company may be exposed to credit risk.  
     
  The Company s trading activities include providing securities brokerage services to institutional clients. To facilitate these customer transactions, the Company purchases proprietary securities positions ( long positions ) in equity securities. The Company also enters into transactions to sell securities not yet purchased ( short positions ), which are recorded as liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Company is exposed to market risk on these long and short securities positions as a result of decreases in market value of long positions and increases in market value of short positions. Short positions create a liability to purchase the security in the market at prevailing prices. Such transactions result in off-balance sheet market risk as the Company s ultimate obligation to satisfy the sale of securities sold, but not yet purchased, may exceed the amount recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. To mitigate the risk of losses, these securities positions are marked to market daily and are monitored by management to assure compliance with limits established by the Company.  
     
  In connection with the CLOs, the Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include unfunded commitments to lend and standby letters of credit. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company.  

- 27 -

Unfunded commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower, provided that all conditions have been met. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since certain commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each borrower s creditworthiness on a case by case basis.  
     
  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance by a borrower to a third party. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to borrowers. In its Corporate segment, the Company had unfunded commitments of $52.7 million and $15.2 million, respectively. $5.3 million and $2.2 million of the unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 relate to commitments traded but not yet closed in CLO I. $22.4 million and $5.0 million of the unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 relate to commitments traded but not yet closed in CLO II. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, the Company had $22.2 million and $4.0 million of the unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2015 relate to commitments traded but not yet closed in CLO III.   
     
   19. Business Segments    
     
  The Company s business results are categorized into the following three business segments: Broker-Dealer, Asset Management, and Corporate. The Broker-Dealer segment includes a broad range of services, such as underwriting and acting as a placement agent for public and private capital markets raising transactions and financial advisory services in M A, restructuring and other strategic transactions. The Broker-Dealer segment also includes institutional brokerage services and equity research services to our institutional investor clients. The Asset Management segment includes the management of a broad range of pooled investment vehicles, including the Company s hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, and collateralized loan obligations. The Corporate segment includes income from the Company s principal investments in public and private securities and investment funds managed by HCS, as well as any other net interest and income from investing activities. The Corporate segment also includes expenses related to JMP Group LLC, JMP Holding LLC and JMP Group Inc., and is mainly comprised of corporate overhead expenses and interest expense related to the Company s bond issuance.   
     
  Management uses Operating Net Income as a key metric when evaluating the performance of JMP Group s core business strategy and ongoing operations. This measure adjusts the Company s net income as follows: (i) reverses non-cash share-based compensation expense related to historical equity awards granted in prior periods, (ii) recognizes 100% of the cost of deferred compensation in the period for which such compensation was awarded, instead of recognizing such cost over the vesting period as required under GAAP, (iii) reverses property depreciation expense resulting from commercial real estate investments; (iv) reverses net unrealized gains and losses on strategic equity investments and warrants, (v) excludes general loan loss reserves on the CLOs, and (vi) presents revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates HCAP Advisors and the CLOs. These charges may otherwise obscure the company s operating income and complicate an assessment of the company s core business activities. The operating pre-tax net income facilitates a meaningful comparison of the Company s results in a given period to those in prior and future periods. The revenues and expenses are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the investment funds Harvest manages.   
     
  The Company s segment information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was prepared using the following methodology:  

Revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining segment operating income.      

Revenues and expenses not directly associated with a specific segment are allocated based on the most relevant measures applicable, including revenues, headcount and other factors.      

Each segment s operating expenses include: a) compensation and benefits expenses that are incurred directly in support of the segments and b) other operating expenses, which include expenses for premises and occupancy, professional fees, travel and entertainment, communications and information services, equipment and indirect support costs (including compensation and other operating expenses related thereto) for administrative services.      

- 28 -

Segment Operating Results   
     
  Management believes that the following information provides a reasonable representation of each segment s contribution to revenues, income and assets:  

- 29 -

The following tables reconcile the total segments to consolidated net income before income tax expense and total assets as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

(a) Non-interest revenue adjustments is comprised of loan sale gains, mark-to-market gains/losses, strategic equity investments and warrants, and fund-related revenues recognized upon consolidation of certain Harvest Funds.  
  (b) The Net Interest Income adjustment is comprised of the non-cash net amortization of liquidity discounts at the CLOs, due to scheduled contractual repayments, and amortization expense related to an intangible asset.   
  (c) Non-interest expense adjustments relate to reversals of share-based compensation and exclusion of fund-related expenses recognized upon consolidation of certain Harvest Funds.  
  (d) Reconciling operating pre-tax net income to Consolidated Net Income before income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations consists of the following:

   Overview   
     
  JMP Group LLC, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ,  we , or  us ), is a full-service investment banking and asset management firm headquartered in San Francisco, California. We have a diversified business model with a focus on small and middle-market companies and provide:  

investment banking, including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and other strategic advisory services, to corporate clients;     

sales and trading, and related brokerage services to institutional investors;     

proprietary equity research in our four target industries;     

asset management products and services to institutional investors, high net-worth individuals and for our own account; and     

management of collateralized loan obligations.     
     
  On May 8, 2015, JMP Investment Holdings formed a 100% owned special purpose vehicle, JMPCA TRS, to enter into a TRS. Under the TRS, we receive the sum of all interest, fees and any positive change in fair value amounts from a loan portfolio held by the counterparty and pay interest on the loan portfolio plus any negative change in fair value amounts from such referenced assets.  
     
   Components of Revenues   
     
  We derive revenues primarily from fees earned from our investment banking business, net commissions on our trading activities in our sales and trading business, asset management fees and incentive fees in our asset management business, and interest income on collateralized loan obligations we manage. We also generate revenues from principal transactions, interest, dividends, and other income.  
     
   Investment Banking   
     
  We earn investment banking revenues from underwriting securities offerings, arranging private capital market transactions and providing advisory services in mergers and acquisitions and other strategic advisory assignments.  
     
   Underwriting Revenues   
     
  We earn underwriting revenues from securities offerings in which we act as an underwriter, such as initial public offerings and follow-on equity offerings. Underwriting revenues include management fees, underwriting fees, selling concessions and realized and unrealized net gains and losses on equity positions held in inventory for a period of time to facilitate the completion of certain underwritten transactions. We record underwriting revenues, net of related syndicate expenses, at the time the underwriting is completed. In syndicated underwritten transactions, management estimates our share of transaction-related expenses incurred by the syndicate, and we recognize revenues net of such expense. On final settlement by the lead manager, typically 90 days from the trade date of the transaction, we adjust these amounts to reflect the actual transaction-related expenses and our resulting underwriting fee. We receive a higher proportion of total fees in underwritten transactions in which we act as a lead manager.

Strategic Advisory Revenues   
     
  Our strategic advisory revenues primarily include success fees on closed merger and acquisition transactions, as well as retainer fees, earned in connection with advising both buyers  and sellers  transactions. We also earn fees for related advisory work and other services such as providing fairness opinions and in valuation analyses. We record strategic advisory revenues when the transactions or the services (or, if applicable, separate components thereof) to be performed are substantially completed, the fees are determinable and collection is reasonably assured.  
     
   Private   Capital Market and other   Revenues   
     
  We earn agency capital market and other fees in non-underwritten transactions such as private placements of equity securities, private investments in public equity ( PIPE ) transactions, Rule 144A private offerings and trust preferred securities offerings. We record private placement revenues on the closing date of these transactions.  
     
  Since our investment banking revenues are generally recognized at the time of completion of each transaction or the services to be performed, these revenues typically vary between periods and may be considerably affected by the timing of the closing of significant transactions.  
     
   Brokerage Revenues   
     
  Our brokerage revenues include commissions paid by customers from brokerage transactions in exchange-listed and over-the-counter ( OTC ) equity securities. Commissions are recognized on a trade date basis. Brokerage revenues also include net trading gains and losses that result from market-making activities and from our commitment of capital to facilitate customer transactions. Our brokerage revenues may vary between periods, in part depending on commission rates, trading volumes and our ability to continue to deliver research and other value-added services to our clients. The ability to execute trades electronically, through the Internet and through other alternative trading systems has increased pressure on trading commissions and spreads. We expect this trend toward alternative trading systems and pricing pressures in our brokerage business to continue. We are, to some extent, compensated through brokerage commissions for the value of research and other value- added services we deliver to our clients. These  soft dollar  practices have been the subject of discussion among regulators, the investment banking community and our sales and trading clients. In particular, commission sharing arrangements have been adopted by some large institutional investors. In these arrangements, institutional investors concentrate their trading with fewer  execution  brokers and pay a fixed amount for execution with an additional amount set aside for payments to other firms for research or other brokerage services. Accordingly, we may experience reduced (or eliminated) trading volume with such investors but may be compensated for our research and sales efforts through allocations of the designated amounts. Depending on the extent to which we adopt this practice and depending on our ability to reach arrangements on terms acceptable to us, this trend would likely impair the revenues and profitability of our commission business by negatively affecting both volumes and trading commissions in our commission business.  
     
   Asset Management Fees   
     
  Asset management fees for hedge funds, hedge funds of funds, private equity funds, and HCC include base management fees and incentive fees earned from managing our family of investment partnerships and a publicly-traded specialty finance company. Earned base management fees are generally based on the fair value of assets under management or aggregate capital commitments and the fee schedule for each fund and account. We also earn incentive fees based upon the performance of investment funds and accounts. For most of the funds, such fees are based on a percentage of the excess of an investment return over a specified high-water mark or hurdle rate over a defined performance period. For private equity funds, incentive fees are based on a specified percentage of realized gains from the disposition of each portfolio investment in which each investor participates, and are earned after returning contributions by the investors for that portfolio investment and for all other portfolio investments in which each such investor participates that have been disposed of at the time of distribution. Generally, we do not earn management fees on assets calculated on an average assets under management ( AUM ) basis.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 the contractual base management fees earned from each of these investment funds or company ranged between 1% and 2% of assets under management or between 1% and 2% of aggregate committed capital. The contractual incentive fees were generally (i) 20%, subject to high-water marks, for the hedge funds; (ii) 5% to 20%, subject to high-water marks or a performance hurdle rate, for the hedge funds of funds; (iii) 20%, subject to high-water marks, for Harvest Growth Capital LLC ( HGC ) and Harvest Growth Capital II LLC ( HGC II ). Our asset management revenues are subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors that are unpredictable, including the overall condition of the economy and the securities markets as a whole and our core sectors. These conditions can have a material effect on the inflows and outflows of assets under management, and the performance of our asset management funds. For example, a significant portion of the performance-based or incentive revenues that we recognize are based on the value of securities held in the funds we manage. The value of these securities includes unrealized gains or losses that may change from one period to another.  
     
  Asset management fees for the collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs ) we manage currently consist only of senior and subordinated base management fees. We recognize base management fees for the CLOs on a monthly basis over the period in which the collateral management services are performed. The base management fees for the CLOs are calculated as a percentage of the average aggregate collateral balances for a specified period. As we consolidate CLO I, CLO II, and CLO III, the management fees earned at JMP Credit Advisors LLC ( JMPCA ) from the CLOs are eliminated on consolidation in accordance with accounting principles GAAP. At September 30, 2016, the contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO I and CLO II were 0.50% of the average aggregate collateral balance for a specified period. The contractual senior and subordinated base management fees earned from CLO III were 0.219% of the average aggregate collateral balance for a specified period.

Redemption provisions of our funds require at least 90 days  advance notice. The redemption provisions do not apply to the CLOs.  

The following tables present certain information with respect to the investment funds managed by HCS, JMPAM and HCAP Advisors, and CLOs and assets referenced by the TRS managed by JMPCA:

AUM related to hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds increased $51.1 million, or 5.0%, from $1,028.6 million at December 31, 2015 to $1,079.7 million at September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily attributed to capital contributions of $128.9 million in the hedge funds and private equity funds managed by HCS and JMPAM and appreciation of $21.3 million in the funds managed by HCS and JMPAM, partially offset by redemptions of $96.3 million related to funds managed by HCS. The increase of capital contributions was driven by the launch of JMPRP in September 2016 and related capital commitments. The redemptions were driven by the closure of HFP in August 2016.  
     
  AUM related to hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds increased $134.4 million, or 15.1%, from $892.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $1,027.0 million at September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributed to $238.3 million subscriptions of private equity funds and capital contributions of $75.3 million in the hedge funds managed by HCS, partially offset by redemptions of $189.6 million related to hedge funds managed by HCS.

   Principal Transactions   
     
  Principal transaction revenues includes realized and unrealized net gains and losses resulting from our principal investments, which include investments in equity and other securities for our own account and as the general partner of funds managed by us, warrants we may receive from certain investment banking assignments, as well as limited partner investments in private funds managed by third parties. In addition, we invest a portion of our capital in a portfolio of equity securities managed by HCS and in side-by-side investments in the funds managed by us. In certain cases, we also co-invest alongside our institutional clients in private transactions resulting from our investment banking business. Principal transaction revenues also include equity method investments in certain real estate funds.  
     
   Gain on Sale and Payoff of Loans   
     
  Gain on sale and payoff of loans consists of gains from the sale and payoff of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities. Gains are recorded when the proceeds exceed the carrying value of the loan.   
     
   Net Dividend Income   
     
  Net dividend income includes dividends from our investments offset by dividend expense for paying short positions in our principal investment portfolio.  
     
   Other Income   
     
  Other income includes revenues from equity method investments and revenues from fee-sharing arrangements with, and fees earned to raise capital for third-party investment partnerships, or funds.   

- 46 -

Interest Income   
     
  Interest income primarily consists of interest income earned on loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued and loans held for investment. Interest income on loans comprises the stated coupon as a percentage of the face amount receivable as well as accretion of purchase discounts and deferred fees. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the respective loans unless such loans are placed on non-accrual status.  
     
   Interest Expense   
     
  Interest expense primarily consists of interest expense incurred on asset-backed securities issued and note payable, and the amortization of bond issuance costs. Interest expense on asset-backed securities is the stated coupon payable as a percentage of the principal amount as well as amortization of the liquidity discount which was recorded at the acquisition date of CLO I. Interest expense is recorded on the accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the respective asset-backed securities issued and note payable.  
     
   Provision for Loan Losses   
     
  Provision for loan losses includes provision for losses recognized on our loan notes and non-revolving credit agreements at JMP Capital (collectively loans held for investment), and on loans collateralizing asset-backed securities ( ABS ) to record them at their estimated net realizable value. A provision for loan losses is charged to expense to establish the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level, in the opinion of management, sufficient to offset estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements. The appropriateness of the allowance and the allowance components are reviewed quarterly. The Company s estimate of each allowance component is based on observable information and on market and third-party data that we believe are reflective of the underlying loan losses being estimated.  
     
  A specific reserve is provided for loans that are considered impaired. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We measure impairment of a loan based upon either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral securing the loan if the loan is collateral dependent, depending on the circumstances and our collection strategy. For those loans at CLO I deemed impaired subsequent to the acquisition date, or loans held at CLO II or CLO III, if the net realizable value is lower than the current carrying value then the carrying value is reduced and the difference is booked as a specific reserve. If the total discount from unpaid principal balance to carrying value is larger than the expected loss at the date of assessment, no provision for loan losses is recognized.  
     
     In addition, we provide an allowance on a loan-by-loan basis for loans held at the CLOs that were purchased after the CLO I acquisition. We employ internally developed and third-party estimation tools for measuring credit risk (loan ratings, probability of default, and exposure at default), which are used in developing an appropriate allowance for loan losses. We perform periodic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to identify risks and to assess the overall collectability of loans.  
     
  Loans which are deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and the charged-off amount results in a reduced allowance.  
     
   Components of Expenses   
     
  We classify our expenses as compensation and benefits, administration, brokerage, clearing and exchange fees, travel and business development, communications and technology, professional fees, impairment loss on purchased management contract and other expenses. A significant portion of our expense base is variable, including compensation and benefits, brokerage clearing and exchange fees, travel and business development and communication and technology expenses.  
     
   Compensation and Benefits   
     
  Compensation and benefits is the largest component of our expenses and includes employees  base pay, performance bonuses, sales commissions, related payroll taxes, medical and benefits expenses, as well as expenses for contractors, temporary employees and equity-based compensation. Our employees receive a substantial portion of their compensation in the form of individual performance-based bonuses. As is the widespread practice in our industry, we pay bonuses on an annual basis, which for senior professionals typically make up a large portion of their total compensation. Bonus payments may have a greater impact on our cash position and liquidity in the periods in which they are paid than would otherwise be reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We accrue for the estimated amount of these bonus payments ratably over the applicable service period.  
     
  Compensation is accrued using specific ratios of total compensation and benefits to total revenues based on revenue categories, as adjusted if, in management s opinion, such adjustments are necessary and appropriate to maintain competitive compensation levels.  
     
   Administration   
     
  Administration expense primarily includes the cost of hosted conferences, non-capitalized systems and software expenditures, insurance, business tax (non-income), office supplies, recruiting, and regulatory fees.  

- 47 -

Brokerage, Clearing and Exchange Fees   
     
  Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees include the cost of floor and electronic brokerage and execution, securities clearance, and exchange fees. In June 2015, we changed our clearing broker from J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp. to National Financial Services. The arrangements with the new clearing broker are consistent with those of the previous clearing broker, including the indemnification agreement described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in brokerage, clearing and exchange fees fluctuate largely in line with the volume of sales and trading activity.  
     
   Travel and Business Development   
     
  Travel and business development expense is net of expenses reimbursed by clients.  
     
   Communications and Technology   
     
  Communications and technology expense primarily relates to communication and information processing as well as the subscription of certain market data.  
     
   Professional Fees   
     
  Professional fees primarily relate to legal and accounting professional services.  
     
   Other Expenses   
     
  Other operating expenses primarily include occupancy, depreciation and CLO administration expense.  
     
   Income Taxes   
     
  JMP Group LLC is a publicly traded partnership, and as such, is taxed as a partnership, and not as a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so long as 90% or more of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes  qualifying income .   
     
  The Company s effective tax rate is directly impacted by the proportion of income subject to tax compared to income not subject to tax. JMP Group Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. The remainder of the Company s income is generally not subject to corporate-level taxation.   
     
  The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, and are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company s assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.   
     
  The Company applies the accounting principles related to uncertainty in income taxes. Under the guidance, the Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authorities  widely understood administrative practices and precedents. If this threshold is met, the Company measures the tax benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  
     
  The Company s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with the tax audits or unrecognized tax benefits, if any, is to record such items as a component of income tax.  
     
   Non  -  controlling Interest   
     
  Non-controlling interest for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes the interest of third parties in CLO I, CLO II, CLO III, and HCAP Advisors, partially-owned subsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements.   
     
  On August 6, 2010, the Company transferred 109 subordinated notes of CLO I to certain employees in exchange for their interests in JMP Credit Corporation. As a result of the aforementioned transfer, we own approximately 94% of the subordinated notes of CLO I.  
     
  On April 30, 2013, entities sponsored by the Company closed on a $343.8 million CLO. The senior notes offered in this transaction (the  Secured Notes ) were issued by CLO II, a special purpose Cayman vehicle, and co-issued in part by JMP Credit Advisors CLO II LLC, a special purpose Delaware vehicle, and were backed by a diversified portfolio of broadly syndicated leveraged loans. The Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, manages CLO II and from issuance through December 31, 2013 owned $17.3 million, or 72.8%, of the subordinated notes of the issuer (the  Subordinated Notes ). In the first quarter of 2014, the Company repurchased $6.0 million of the subordinated notes, increasing its ownership to 98.0%.  
     
  On September 30, 2014, the Company closed on a $370.5 million CLO. The senior notes offered in this transaction were issued by CLO III, and are backed primarily by a diversified portfolio of broadly syndicated leveraged loans. These senior notes are subject to a two-year non-call period. The CLO has a four-year reinvestment period, through October 17, 2018, that allows for the use of the proceeds from any principal repayments on, or any sales of, collateral assets towards the purchase of qualifying replacement assets, subject to certain conditions and limitations. The Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, manages CLO III and as of September 30, 2014, the Company owned 13.5% of the subordinated notes of the issuer. The Company was identified as the primary beneficiary based on the ability to direct activities of CLO III through its subsidiary manager, JMP Credit Advisors, and its equity ownership. On September 27, 2016, the Company repurchased $12.8 million of the unsecured subordinated notes from CLO III non-controlling interests, increasing the Company s ownership from 13.5% to 46.7%.  
     
  HCAP Advisors was formed on December 18, 2012. HCAP Advisors appointed JMP Group LLC as its Manager effective May 1, 2013, and began offering investment advisory services. The Company owns 51% equity interest in the entity.

Th  ree   M  onths Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015   
     
   Overview   
     
  Total net revenues after provision for loan losses increased $2.6 million, or 9.2%, from $28.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to $30.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, resulting from a $3.8 million increase in non-interest revenues, a $0.7 million reversal in provision for loan losses, partially offset by a decline in net interest income of $1.9 million.   
     
  Non-interest revenues increased $3.8 million, or 16.2%, from $23.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to $27.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.This increase was primarily driven by a $4.2 million in principal transactions and $3.1 million in investment banking, partially offset by a $2.9 million decrease in asset management and $1.0 million in brokerage revenues.   
     
  Provision for loan losses decreased $0.7 million from $0.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to a $0.1 million reversal for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Total non-interest expenses were $29.6 million and $29.7 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.   
     
  Net income attributable to JMP Group LLC increased $3.7 million, or 122.1%, from a $3.0 million loss after an income tax benefit of $0.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to $0.7 million after an income tax benefit of $0.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.   
     
   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
     
   Overview   
     
  Total net revenues after provision for loan losses decreased $10.5 million, or 9.6%, from $109.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $99.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, resulting from a decline in non-interest revenues of $5.3 million, a decline in net interest income of $4.4 million, and an increase in provision for loan losses of $0.9 million.   
     
  Non-interest revenues decreased $5.3 million, or 5.7%, from $93.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $88.2 million in the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by a $12.2 million decline in investment banking, partially offset by a $5.2 million increase in principal transactions.   
     
  Provision for loan losses increased $0.9 million from $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
     
  Total non-interest expenses decreased $5.9 million, or 5.9%, from $99.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $93.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to a $6.3 million decline in compensation and benefits.  
     
  Net income attributable to JMP Group LLC increased $1.2 million, or 126.6%, from $0.9 million after income tax expense of $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.1 million after income tax benefit of $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
     
   Operating Net Income (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)   
     
  Management uses Operating Net Income as a key, non-GAAP metric when evaluating the performance of JMP Group LLC s core business strategy and ongoing operations, as management believes that this metric appropriately illustrates the operating results of JMP Group LLC s core operations and business activities. Operating Net Income is derived from our segment reported results and is the measure of segment profitability on an after-tax basis used by management to evaluate our performance. This non-GAAP measure is presented to enhance investors  overall understanding of our current financial performance. Additionally, management believes that Operating Net Income is a useful measure because it allows for a better evaluation of the performance of JMP Group LLC s ongoing business and facilitates a meaningful comparison of the company s results in a given period to those in prior and future periods.   
     
  However, Operating Net Income should not be considered a substitute for results that are presented in a manner consistent with GAAP. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that, unless otherwise indicated, the adjustments concern gains, losses or expenses that JMP Group LLC generally expects to continue to recognize, and the adjustment of these items should not always be construed as an inference that these gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, management believes that both JMP Group LLC s GAAP measures of its financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together. Operating Net Income may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure presented by other companies.  
     
  Operating Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts the Company s GAAP net income as follows:

  reverses non-cash share-based compensation expense recognized under GAAP related to equity awards granted in prior periods, as management generally evaluates performance by considering the full expense of equity awards granted in the period in which such compensation was awarded, even if the expense of that award will be recognized in future periods under GAAP;      

(ii)   
 
  recognizes 100% of the cost of deferred compensation in the period for which such compensation was awarded, instead of recognizing such cost over the vesting period as required under GAAP, in order to match compensation expense with the actual period upon which the compensation was based;     

(iii)   
 
  reverses property depreciation expense resulting from commercial real estate investments;

(iv)   
 
  reverses net unrealized gains and losses on strategic equity investments and warrants;     

(v)   
 
  presents revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates HCAP Advisors and the CLOs;      

(vi)   
 
  excludes general loan loss reserves on certain CLOs; and     

(vii)   
 
  assumes a combined federal, state and local income tax rate of 38% at the taxable direct subsidiary of parent company, while applying a tax rate of 0% to the Company s other direct subsidiary, which is a  pass-through entity  for tax purposes. For the purposes of calculating operating net income, an effective tax rate of 38% is assumed for our taxable subsidiaries, based on our best estimation of the subsidiary s average rate of taxation over the long term.

Net interest income decreased $1.9 million, from $5.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to $3.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The net interest income decline was driven primarily by the decrease in CLO I interest earned in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of the repayment of low cost AAA-rated ABS issued as well as increases in Libor. The decrease in interest earned at CLO II and CLO III was due to rising Libor increasing the cost of the liabilities but, because of Libor floors on most of the loans in the portfolios, not increasing the interest income.

The decrease was primarily attributed to a new commission plan that was implemented in the third quarter of 2015. Equity-based compensation was $6.3 million and $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The equity-based compensation included a $1.0 million decline in share options and share appreciation rights and a $1.1 million decline related to RSUs.   
     
  Compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenues increased from 69.9% of total net revenues after provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 71.0% for the same period in 2016.   
     
  Our segment reported compensation and benefits, which recognizes 100% of the cost of deferred compensation, including non-cash share-based compensation expense, in the period for which such compensation was awarded, instead of recognizing such cost over the vesting period as required under GAAP, in order to match compensation expense with the actual period upon which the compensation was based. The segment reported compensation and benefits decreased $1.3 million from $68.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $67.0 million for the same period ended September 30, 2016. As a percent of total segment net revenues, compensation and benefits were 66.3% and 70.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Administration   
     
  Administration expense decreased $0.1 million, from $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, administration expense increased from 5.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 5.7% for the same period in 2016.  
     
   Brokerage, Clearing and   Exchange Fees   
     
  Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees were $2.5 million and $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, our brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased from 2.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 2.3% for the same period in 2016.  
     
   Travel and Business Development   
     
  Travel and business development expenses increased $0.2 million, from $3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, travel and business development expense were 3.0% and 3.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.   
     
   Communications and Technology   
     
  Communications and technology expenses were $2.9 million and $3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, communications and technology expense increased from 2.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 3.1% for the same period in 2016.   
     
   Professional Fees   
     
  Professional fees decreased $0.1 million from $3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, professional fees increased from 3.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 3.3% for the same period in 2016.   
     
   Other Expenses   
     
  Other expenses increased $0.3 million, or 5.8%, from $5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was attributed to a $0.1 million increase in occupancy and a $0.1 million increase in depreciation. As a percentage of total net revenues after provision for loan losses, other expenses were 4.8% and 5.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  
     
   Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest   
     
  Net income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased from $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was mainly attributed to the purchase of $12.8 million of the unsecured subordinated notes from CLO III non-controlling interests in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, which decreased the non-controlling interest ownership from 86.5% to 53.3%. Non-controlling interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 includes the interest of third parties in CLO I, CLO II, CLO III, and HCAP Advisors.   
     
   Provision for Income   Taxes   
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded income tax benefit of $0.8 million and income tax expense of $3.8 million, respectively. The $4.6 million reduction in income expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to a one-time tax event in the prior year, triggered by the Reorganization Transaction.  
     
  For the purposes of calculating operating net income, an effective tax rate of 38% is assumed for our taxable subsidiaries, based on our best estimation of the subsidiary s average rate of taxation over the long term. Segment income tax expense decreased $3.9 million, from $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to a $1.9 million tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
     
   Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  In the section that follows, we discuss the significant changes in the components of our balance sheet, cash flows and capital resources and liquidity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to demonstrate where our capital is invested and the financial condition of the Company.  
     
   Overview   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had net liquid assets of $96.4 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from short sales on deposit, receivable from clearing broker, marketable securities owned, and general partner investments in hedge funds managed by HCS, net of marketable securities sold but not yet purchased, accrued compensation, deferred compensation paid in January 2014, and non-controlling interest. We have satisfied our capital and liquidity requirements primarily through the net proceeds from the January 2013 issuance of the 2013 Senior Notes, the January 2014 issuance of the 2014 Senior Notes, and internally generated cash from operations. Most of our financial instruments, other than loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued, loans held for investment and asset-backed securities issued, are recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had Level 3 assets (financial instruments measured on a recurring basis whose fair value was determined using unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data) of $6.9 million and $13.3 million, respectively, which represented 0.6% of total assets for both periods.

Liquidity Considerations Related to   CLOs   
     
  On April 7, 2009, we invested $4.0 million of cash and granted $3.0 million original par amount, with a $2.3 million estimated fair value, of contingent consideration (a zero coupon note) to acquire 100% of the membership interests and net assets of $7.5 million of CLO I. In December 2009, we repurchased the contingent consideration for $1.8 million. As we own substantially all of the subordinated securities of the CLO, in accordance with the authoritative guidance under GAAP on accounting for consolidation of variable interest entities, we are the primary beneficiary and are required to consolidate all of the assets and liabilities of the CLO securitization structure even though it is a bankruptcy remote entity with no recourse to us.  
     
  Our maximum exposure to loss of capital on the CLOs is the original April 7, 2009 investment of $4.0 million plus the $1.8 million paid to repurchase the contingent consideration related to the CLO I acquisition, $23.3 million related to CLO II, and $12.9 million investment related to CLO III plus any earnings retained in the CLOs since the acquisition or inception dates. However, for U.S. federal tax purposes, the CLOs are treated as disregarded entities such that the taxable income earned in the CLO is taxable to us. If the CLOs are in violation of certain coverage tests, mainly any of its over-collateralization ratios, residual cash flows otherwise payable to us as owners of the subordinated notes would be required to be used to repay indebtedness senior to us in the securitization, or, for CLO II or CLO III, potentially to buy additional collateral. This could require us to pay income tax on earnings prior to the residual cash flow distributions to us.   
     
  The CLOs must comply with certain asset coverage tests, such as tests that restrict the amount of discounted obligations and obligations rated  CCC  or lower it can hold. During any time the CLO exceeds such a limit, our ability, as the manager of CLO I, to sell assets and reinvest available principal proceeds into substitute assets is restricted. In addition, defaulted obligations, discounted assets (those purchased below 85% of the par value for CLO I and generally below 80% of the par value for CLO II and CLO III) and assets rated  CCC  or lower in excess of applicable limits in the CLOs investment criteria are not given full par credit for purposes of calculation of the CLO over-collateralization ( OC ) tests. We were in compliance with all OC tests on the determination dates since February 2010. However, we have been in violation and may be in the future. If CLOs were to violate any of the secured note OC tests, we would be required to pay down the most senior notes with the residual cash flows until the violation was cured. In the most extreme case, if the CLO were in violation of the most senior OC test, the Class A note holders would have the ability to declare an event of default and cause an acceleration of all principal and interest outstanding on the notes.  
     
  For financial reporting purposes, the loans and asset-backed securities of the CLOs are consolidated on our balance sheet. The loans are reported at their cost adjusted for amortization of liquidity discounts and credit reserves, both of which were recorded at the CLO I acquisition date, purchase discounts and allowance for loan losses. The asset-backed securities are recorded net of liquidity discounts and original issue discounts. At September 30, 2016, we had $823.7 million of loans collateralizing asset-backed securities, net, $123.0 million of restricted cash and $2.1 million of interest receivable funded by $857.4 million of asset-backed securities issued, net, and interest payable of $4.4 million. These assets and liabilities represented 81.3% of total assets and 83.8% of total liabilities respectively, reported on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016.  
     
  The tables below summarize the loans held by the CLOs grouped by range of outstanding balance, Moody s Investors Services, Inc. rating category and industry as of September 30, 2016.

Other Liquidity Considerations   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, our indebtedness consists of our bonds payable. We have no outstanding balances on our revolving lines of credit with City National Bank ( CNB ), related to JMP Holding LLC or JMP Securities.

In January 2013, we raised approximately $46.0 million from the sale of 8.00% Senior Notes ( 2013 Senior Notes ). In January 2014, we raised an additional approximate $48.3 million from the sale of 7.25% Senior Notes ( 2014 Senior Notes ). The 2013 Senior Notes will mature on January 15, 2023 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company s option on or after January 15, 2016, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2013 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.00% per year, payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. The 2014 Senior Notes will mature on January 15, 2021, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company s option on or after January 15, 2017, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. These 2014 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year, payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. In February 2016, the Company purchased $0.5 million face value of the Senior Notes for $0.4 million.   
     
  In connection with the Reorganization Transaction, we entered into a Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 15, 2014 (the  Third Supplemental Indenture ), among the JMP Group Inc., JMP Group LLC and JMP Investment Holdings LLC, as guarantors (the  Guarantors ), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Third Supplemental Indenture became effective on January 1, 2015. Under the Third Supplemental Indenture, the Guarantors have jointly and severally provided a full and unconditional guarantee of the due and punctual payment of the principal and interest on the Senior Notes, and the due and punctual payment or performance of all other obligations of JMP Group Inc. under the Indenture, dated as of January 24, 2013, between JMP Group Inc. and the Trustee, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 25, 2013, a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 29, 2014 and the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 15, 2014.  
     
  The Company s Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ), dated as of August 3, 2006, between JMP Holding LLC and CNB, was subsequently amended. The Credit Agreement and subsequent amendments provide a $25.0 million line of credit with a revolving period of two years through April 30, 2017. On such date, any outstanding amounts convert to a term loan. The term loan will be repaid in quarterly installments of 3.75% of funded debt for the first two years, 5.00% of funded debt for the next two years, and the remainder due at maturity. Proceeds for this line of credit will be used to make financial investments, for working capital purposes, for general corporate purposes, as well as a $5.0 million sublimit to issue letters of credit. The Company s outstanding balance on this line of credit was zero as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  The Credit Agreement for the term loan provides that the proceeds of the CNB Loans are subject to the following restrictions: (i) the Initial Term Loan and up to $5.0 million of the Revolving Line of Credit Loans may not be used for any purpose other than to fund certain permitted investments and acquisitions and to fund JMP Holding LLC s working capital needs in the ordinary course of its business; (ii) all other proceeds of the Revolving Line of Credit may not be used for any purpose other than to make investments in HCS and by HCS to make investments in loans that are made to persons that are not affiliates of borrower; and (iii) the Term Loan may not be used for any purpose other than to make equity investments in CLOs and by CLOs to make certain permitted investments in collateralized loan obligations.   
     
  The Credit Agreement includes minimum fixed charge coverage ratios applicable to us and our subsidiaries, a minimum net worth covenant applicable to us and our subsidiaries and a minimum liquidity covenant applicable to JMP Holding LLC and its subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of these financial covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes an event of default for a  change of control  that tests, in part, the composition of our ownership and an event of default if two or more of the members of the Company s Executive Committee fail to be involved actively on an ongoing basis in the management of JMP Holding LLC or any of its subsidiaries. The CNB Loans are guaranteed by HCS and secured by a lien on substantially all assets of JMP Holding LLC and HCS.  
     
  Separately, under a Revolving Note and Cash Subordination Agreement, JMP Securities holds a $20.0 million revolving line of credit with CNB (the  Broker/Deal Line of Credit ) to be used for regulatory capital purposes during its securities underwriting activities. The unused portion of the line bears interest at the rate of 0.25% per annum, paid monthly. The line of credit was scheduled to mature May 6, 2016, at which time any existing outstanding amount would convert to a term loan maturing the following year. On April 26, 2016, JMP Securities entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement (the  Amendment ). Pursuant to this Amendment, the $20.0 million line of credit held at JMP Securities, which was scheduled to mature May 6, 2016, was renewed for one year. On May 6, 2017, any existing outstanding amount will convert to a term loan maturing the following year. The remaining terms of this line of credit are consistent with those of the existing line of credit. There was no borrowing on this line of credit as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  The timing of bonus compensation payments to our employees may significantly affect our cash position and liquidity from period to period. While our employees and managing directors are generally paid semi-monthly during the year, bonus compensation, which makes up a larger portion of total compensation, is generally paid once a year during the first two months of the following year. In the first two months of 2016, we paid out $32.9 million of cash bonuses for 2015, excluding employer payroll tax expense.  

- 67 -

In January 2015, we converted to a publicly traded partnership. The Company currently intends to continue to declare monthly cash distributions on all outstanding shares. The following table represents cash distributions made in 2016.  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 786,099 of the Company s shares at an average price of $5.33 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $4.2 million. 7,160 repurchased shares were deemed to have been repurchased in connection with employee stock plans, whereby the Company s shares were issued on a net basis to employees for the payment of applicable statutory withholding taxes and therefore, such withheld shares are deemed to be purchased by the Company. The remaining shares were repurchased on the open market.  
     
  We had total restricted cash of $124.0 million comprised primarily of $122.9 million of restricted cash at JMP Investment Holdings on September 30, 2016. This balance was comprised of $10.0 million in interest received from loans in the CLOs, and $112.9 million in principal cash. The interest and fees will be restricted until the next payment date to note holders of the CLOs. The principal restricted cash will be used to buy additional loans or pay down the senior debt in the CLO.   
     
  Because of the nature of our investment banking and sales and trading businesses, liquidity is important to us. Accordingly, we regularly monitor our liquidity position, including our cash and net capital positions. We believe that our available liquidity and current level of equity capital, combined with the net proceeds to us from the funds anticipated to be provided by our operating activities, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and regulatory capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. If circumstances required it, we could improve our liquidity position by discontinuing repurchases of the Company s common shares, halting cash distributions on our common shares and reducing cash bonus compensation paid.  
     
  JMP Securities, our wholly-owned subsidiary and a registered securities broker-dealer, is subject to the SEC s Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, and requires that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital, both as defined, shall not exceed 15 to 1. SEC regulations also provide that equity capital may not be withdrawn or cash dividends paid if certain minimum net capital requirements are not met. JMP Securities had net capital of $29.1 million and $25.1 million, which were $28.1 million and $23.0 million in excess of the required net capital of $1.0 million and $2.1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. JMP Securities  ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was 0.52 to 1 and 1.25 to 1 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
     
  A condensed table of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is presented below.  

Cash   Flows   for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   
     
  Cash increased by $20.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of cash provided by investing activities, partially offset by cash provided by operating and financing activities.   
     
  Our operating activities provided $5.1 million of cash from the net income of $6.2 million, adjusted for the cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $9.3 million, and by non-cash revenue and expense items of $10.4 million. The cash used by the change in operating assets and liabilities included a decline of accrued compensation and other liabilities of $11.9 million, partially offset by a decline in receivables of $7.9 million and a $6.9 million decrease in marketable securities.   
     
  Our investing activities provided $106.4 million of cash primarily due to the sale and payoff of loans collateralizing ABS of $279.4 million, and principal receipts on loans collateralizing asset-backed securities of $52.0 million, partially offset by $185.6 million funding of loans collateralizing ABS and $72.3 million increase in restricted cash for lending activities due trades made at the CLOs but not yet settled.   
     
  Our financing activities used $91.4 million of cash primarily due to $74.6 million repayment of ABS issued, $6.2 million distributions and distribution equivalents     paid on common shares and RSUs and $5.9 million distributions to non-controlling shareholders.   

- 68 -

Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
     
  Cash decreased by $38.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of cash used in operating and financing activities, partially offset by cash provided by investing activities.   
     
  Our operating activities used $11.3 million of cash from net income of $6.3 million, adjusted for the cash used by operating assets and liabilities of $20.6 million, and provided by non-cash revenue and expense items of $3.0 million. The cash used by the change in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease in accrued compensation and other liabilities of $30.8 million, an increase in marketable securities of $5.2 million, partially offset by a decline in deposits and other assets of $10.5 million.  
     
  Our investing activities provided $29.3 million of cash primarily due to $244.2 million funding of loans collateralizing ABS, $25.0 million cash collateral posted for our derivative transaction, partially offset by the sale and payoff of loans collateralizing ABS of $232.5 million, and principal receipts on loans collateralizing asset-backed securities of $64.0 million.   
     
  Our financing activities used $56.8 million of cash primarily due to $42.5 million repayment of ABS issued, $7.3 million distributions and distribution equivalents     paid on common shares and RSUs, and $7.1 million distributions to non-controlling interest shareholders.   
     
      Contractual Obligations   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, our aggregate minimum future commitment on our leases was $20.8 million. See Note 13 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Our remaining contractual obligations have not materially changed from those reported in our Annual Report.  
     
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
  In connection with the CLOs, the Company had unfunded commitments to lend of $52.7 million and $15.2 million and standby letters of credit of $1.2 million and $1.6 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The funds for the unfunded commitments to lend and the cash collateral supporting these standby letters of credit are included in restricted cash on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of September 30, 2016. These commitments do not extend to JMP Group LLC. See Note 18 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in connection with the CLOs.  
     
  Unfunded commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower, provided that all conditions have been met. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since certain commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each borrower s creditworthiness on a case by case basis.  
     
  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance by a borrower to a third party. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to borrowers.  
     
  We had no other material off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016. However, as described below under  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  through indemnification provisions in our clearing agreements with our clearing broker, customer activities may expose us to off-balance sheet credit risk, which we seek to mitigate through customer screening and collateral requirements.     
     
   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
     
  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The use of different estimates and assumptions could produce materially different results. For example, if factors such as those discussed under the caption  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report cause actual events to differ from the assumptions we used in applying the accounting policies, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.   
     
  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, particularly as they relate to accounting policies that we believe are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We regard an accounting estimate or assumption to be most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations where:   

the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and      

the impact of the estimates or assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material.      

- 69 -

Using the foregoing criteria, we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies:   

Valuation of Financial Instruments       

Asset Management Investment Partnerships      

L  oans   Collateralizing Asset-backed Securities   Issued         

Allowance for Loan Losses      

Asset-backed Securities Issued      

Legal and Other Contingent Liabilities      

Income Taxes      
     
  Our significant accounting policies are described further in the  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  section and Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report.  

ITEM 3.    
 
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk      
     
   Market Risk   
     
  Market risk represents the risk of loss that may result from the change in value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in its market price. Market risk may be exacerbated in times of trading illiquidity when market participants refrain from transacting in normal quantities and/or at normal bid-offer spreads. Our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as a financial intermediary in customer trading and to our market making and investment activities. Market risk is inherent in financial instruments.  
     
  Even though we trade in equity securities as an active participant in both listed and OTC markets and we make markets in approximately 980 stocks, we typically maintain very few securities in inventory overnight to minimize market risk. In addition, we act as agent rather than principal whenever we can and may use a variety of risk management techniques and hedging strategies in the ordinary course of our trading business to manage our exposures. Historically, in connection with our principal investments in publicly-traded equity securities, we have engaged in short sales of equity securities to offset the risk of purchasing other equity securities.   
     
  In connection with our sales and trading business, management evaluates the amount of risk in specific trading activities and determines our tolerance for such activities. Management monitors risks in its trading activities by establishing limits for the trading desk and reviewing daily trading results, inventory aging, and securities concentrations. Typically, market conditions are evaluated and transaction details and securities positions are reviewed. These activities seek to ensure that trading strategies are within acceptable risk tolerance parameters. Activities include price verification procedures, position reconciliations and reviews of transaction bookings. We believe these procedures, which stress timely communications between traders, trading management and senior management, are important elements of the risk management process.  
     
   Equity Price and Liquidity Risk   
     
  Equity price and liquidity risk represents the potential loss in value due to adverse changes in the level of market activity and volatility of equity prices. We are exposed to equity price and liquidity risk through our trading activities in both listed and OTC equity markets and security positions in our principal investment portfolio. We attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by establishing position limits, monitoring inventory turnover and entering into hedging transactions designed to mitigate our market risk profile.  
     
  Our marketable securities owned include long positions in equity securities that were recorded at a fair value of $21.6 million as of September 30, 2016. Our marketable securities sold but not yet purchased consist of short positions in equity securities and were recorded at a fair value of $8.9 million as of September 30, 2016. The net potential loss in fair value for our marketable equity securities portfolio as of September 30, 2016, using a hypothetical 10% decline in prices, is estimated to be approximately $1.3 million. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, we have invested $29.5 million of our own capital in our funds, which are invested primarily in publicly traded equity securities. The net potential loss in fair value for our investments at September 30, 2016, using a hypothetical 10% decline in the funds  investment portfolios, is estimated to be approximately $2.9 million.   
     
   Interest Rate Risk   
     
  Interest rate risk represents the potential loss from adverse changes in market interest rates. As we may hold U.S. Treasury securities and other fixed income securities and may incur interest-sensitive liabilities from time to time, we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and in the shape of the yield curve.   

- 70 -

As of September 30, 2016, approximately 92.2% of our combined CLO portfolios had LIBOR floors with a weighted average floor of 0.95%. Many of the loans in CLO portfolios have variable interest rates indexed to LIBOR and subject to a LIBOR floor, which provides additional income during periods when LIBOR rates are below the floor levels. Loans with a LIBOR floor pay an interest rate of LIBOR plus the applicable margin so long as LIBOR remains above the specified floor level. If, however, LIBOR falls below the floor, the interest rate is the floor level plus the applicable margin. The asset backed securities issued by our CLOs typically have variable interest rates indexed to LIBOR, but do not have LIBOR floors. Accordingly, in a low interest rate environment, the equity holders of our CLOs benefit from a so called LIBOR floor benefit. If the LIBOR increases above the applicable LIBOR floors, the variable interest payments on the CLO asset backed securities will also increase, and the LIBOR floor benefit to us will decrease. This would diminish the return on equity of our CLOs that we hold, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.  
     
   Credit Risk   
     
  Our broker-dealer subsidiary places and executes customer orders. The orders are then settled by an unrelated clearing organization that maintains custody of customers  securities and provides financing to customers.  
     
  Through indemnification provisions in our agreement with our clearing organization, customer activities may expose us to off-balance-sheet credit risk. We may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices in the event a customer fails to settle a trade on its original terms or in the event cash and securities in customer margin accounts are not sufficient to fully cover customer obligations. We seek to control the risks associated with brokerage services for our customers through customer screening and selection procedures as well as through requirements that customers maintain margin collateral in compliance with governmental and self-regulatory organization regulations and clearing organization policies.  
     
  Credit risk also includes the risk that we will not fully collect the principal we have invested in loans held for investment and loans collateralizing asset-backed securities issued due to borrower defaults. While we feel that our origination and underwriting of these loans will help to mitigate the risk of significant borrower defaults on these loans, we cannot assure you that all borrowers will continue to satisfy their payment obligations under these loans, thereby avoiding default.  
     
   Inflation Risk   
     
  Because our assets are generally liquid in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects such expenses as employee compensation and communications charges, which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of services we offer. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets, it may adversely affect our combined financial condition and results of operations in certain businesses.  

ITEM 4.    
 
   Controls and Procedures      
     
  Our management, with the participation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer) and the Chief Financial Officer (the principal financial officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   
     
   PART II OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1.    
 
   Legal Proceedings      
     
  We are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration matters arising in connection with our business. The outcome of matters we have been and currently are involved in cannot be determined at this time, and the results cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future period and a significant judgment could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may in the future become involved in additional litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including litigation that could be material to our business. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, believes that the currently known actions or threats against us will not result in any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  

ITEM 1A.    
 
   Risk Factors      
     
  The risk factors included in our Annual Report continue to apply to us, and describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. There have not been any material changes from the risk factors previously described in our Annual Report.
