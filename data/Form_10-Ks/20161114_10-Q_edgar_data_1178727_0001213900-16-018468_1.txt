        BASIS
    OF PRESENTATION     

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States for interim financial statements. Accordingly, such interim financial statements do not include
all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete annual
financial statements. The information furnished reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items which are,
in the opinion of management, necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading. The balance sheet as of December
31, 2015 has been derived from the Company s annual financial statements that were audited by an independent registered
public accounting firm, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required for complete annual financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015.  

2.   
         
        RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS     

A
party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries controls,
is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its
management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which
the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to
an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which
can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest
in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties
might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.  

The
accounts payable due to a related party at December 31, 2015 was comprised of $6,000 of director fees which were paid in January
2016.  

3.   
         
        INVENTORY     

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes materials, labor and manufacturing
overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand, future
purchase commitments with its suppliers, and the estimated utility of its inventory. If the review indicates a reduction in utility
below carrying value, inventory is reduced to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of goods sold. Allowance for slow moving
items decreased $15,383 due to the sale of an aerostat launcher. Inventory consists of the following at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015:   

4.   
         
        PROPERTY
    AND EQUIPMENT     

Property
and equipment is recorded at cost when acquired.  Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which is 3-7 years for equipment, furniture and fixtures, hardware and
software and leasehold improvements.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company invested
$6,140 in shop machinery and equipment, $4,981 in computers and electronics and $2,978 in office furniture and fixtures.
Depreciation expense was $25,132 and $10,809 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Property
and equipment consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:   

5.   
         
        INTANGIBLE
    ASSETS     

On
July 20, 2015, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire exclusive commercial software licenses for the
 GUST  (Georgia Tech UAV Simulation Tool) autopilot system from Adaptive Flight, Inc. ( AFI ) Through
the purchase of the assets of privately held AFI, the Company assumed transferable licenses from the Georgia Tech Research
Corporation, which included flight simulation tools and fault tolerant flight control algorithms. In addition, the Company acquired
AFI s dedicated flight computer and additional related hardware and airframes. The Company paid $100,000 in immediately
available funds and $100,000 to be held in escrow. In addition, the Company issued 150,000 shares of unregistered common stock
valued at $8.40 per share on the date of agreement, to be held in escrow.   

The
Company had a milestone of twelve months from July 20, 2015 to complete a technology Integration Plan, the non-completion of which
may result in the return of the purchased assets and termination of the Company s obligations to release the escrow cash
and shares. Additional milestones include exclusive, no-cost and perpetual licenses to all contributing intellectual property
included or related to the purchased assets. As such time as all milestones are met, one-half of the escrow shares will be released
to AFI. Upon termination of the Escrow Agreement, anticipated to be twelve months from the closing of the asset purchase, if all
milestones have been met, the remaining escrowed shares will be released to AFI, but if all milestones have not been met, the
escrowed cash and escrowed shares will be released to the Company and the purchased assets will be returned to AFI. According
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, if the escrow share value is less than $1,400,000, the Company must issue an additional
number of unregistered shares, not to exceed 50,000 shares. At December 31, 2015, the value of the 150,000 shares was $3.23 per
share, or $484,500. The Company recorded $161,500 as an additional liability and expense at December 31, 2015 for the cost of
50,000 shares at $3.23 per share.  

On
June 3, 2016, the Integration Plan was deemed to be completed. At June 3, 2016, the value of the 150,000 shares was $3.01 per
share, or $451,150. The additional liability was reduced to $150,500 for the cost of 50,000 shares at $3.01 per share. The Company
recorded the $11,000 reduction in the additional liability through the statement of operations at June 3, 2016. The Company began
amortizing the $1,460,000 of purchased assets over a sixty month period on June 3, 2016 in the amount of $24,333 per month. Total
amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $97,333. The Company and AFI instructed the Escrow Agent
to disburse the cash and 150,000 shares of stock. The Company issued an additional 50,000 shares valued at $150,500 as described
above.  

The
asset acquisition did not qualify as a business combination under FASB ASC 805-10 and has been accounted for as a regular
asset purchase.   

6.   
        CONVERTIBLE
    NOTES PAYABLE AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITY     

On
September 29, 2016, the Company issued Convertible Promissory Notes Series 2016 due October 1, 2017 in the aggregate principal
amount of $3,000,000 in a private placement to the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Strategic Advisory Board of the
Company. The notes bear interest at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum. The Company may prepay the notes at any time without
penalty. If the Company does not prepay a note in full or the holder does not convert the note before the maturity date, the Company
may pay the outstanding principal amount and any accrued and unpaid interest on the maturity date with cash or with common stock
or through a combination of cash and stock at the Company s discretion. The conversion price of the notes is the lesser
of $3.00 per share or eight-five percent (85%) of the lowest per share purchase price of common stock in the next sale of common
stock in which the Company receives gross proceeds of an amount greater than or equal to $3,000,000.   

Under
ASC 815, these notes require liability classification and must be measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period.  

As
defined in FASB ASC 820, the fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilized the market data
of similar entities in its industry or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including
assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable,
market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability of those
inputs. FASB ASC 820 established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement).  

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  

Level
1 -  Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets
are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives, marketable securities
and listed equities.  

Level
2 -  Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which are either directly or indirectly
observable as of the reported date and includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities,
time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant
economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument,
can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
Instruments in this category generally include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, options
and collars.  

Level
3 -  Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may
be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value.  

The
following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the Company s financial assets and liabilities that
were accounted for at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

The
following table represents the change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities during the nine months ended September 30,
2016:  

The amortization of the debt discount
is $2,822 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The $3,000,000 payable associated with the Convertible Promissory Notes
Series 2016 due October 1, 2017 as of September 30, 2016 is $607,484, which is net of a $2,392,152 debt discount. 

7.   
        SHAREHOLDERS 
    EQUITY     

On
October 29, 2015, a 1:40 reverse split of the Company stock occurred and the effect has been applied retroactively for disclosure
purposes.  

The
Company issued a total of 3,681,635 shares of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as described below:  

The
Company issued 2,500 shares of common stock pursuant to conversions of an aggregate of 1,000 shares of Series A preferred stock.  

The
Company issued 183,468 shares of common stock pursuant to conversions of an aggregate of 73,387 shares of Series C preferred stock.  

The
Company issued 50,000 shares of common stock pursuant to conversions of an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of Series D preferred
stock.  

The
Company issued 50,000 shares of common stock pursuant to conversions of an aggregate of 1,999,998 shares of Series F preferred
stock.  

The
Company issued 50,000 shares of common stock pursuant to conversions of an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of Series G preferred
stock.  

The Company issued 50,000 shares of
restricted common stock to AFI, as discussed above in Note 5, after all milestones had been met as a requirement of the terms of
the Escrow Agreement because the value of the escrowed shares fell below $1,400,000 and triggered a  make whole  provision. 

The
Company issued 100,000 shares of restricted common stock with monthly vesting provisions to a newly-appointed director, Lt. Gen.
Michael T. Flynn, for 24 months of services. Lt. Gen. Flynn can earn a pro rata portion of the shares, calculated based on the
twenty four-month vesting schedule. The Company recognized a total of $60,495 expense for the pro rata portion of shares earned
by Lt. Gen. Flynn during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The Company issued 150,000 shares of
restricted common stock with monthly vesting provisions to Strategic Advisory Board members, Dr. Philip Frost and Steven Rubin,
for 12 months of services. The advisors can earn a pro rata portion of the shares, calculated based on the twelve-month vesting
period, in the event the service agreements are terminated prior to the expiration date as described in the agreements. The Company
recognized a total of $211,890 expense for the pro rata portion of shares earned by the two members during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. 

The Company issued 1,150,000 shares
of restricted common stock outside of the 2015 Equity Plan to Jay Nussbaum, Felicia Hess, Daniyel Erdberg, Kendall Carpenter, and
Kevin Hess pursuant to Stock Award Agreements. The shares will vest upon consummation of a significant equity and/or debt financing
at least equal to the November 2015 financing which raised $3,725,000 provided that the holder remains engaged by the Company through
the vesting date. Stock based compensation of $3,346,615 was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as the
shares became fully vested on September 29, 2016 by resolution of the Board of Directors that the issuance of the Convertible Promissory
Notes Series 2016 due October 1, 2017 qualified as such a significant financing. 

On September 29, 2016, the Company
issued 496,667 shares of restricted common stock to twelve investors that were party to the November 2015 private placement, pursuant
to the purchase agreement for such private placement. These investors purchased stock at $5.00 per share and under the purchase
agreement received twelve months of price protection. The Convertible Promissory Notes Series 2016 due October 1, 2017 included
a $3.00 per share conversion factor, thereby triggering the price protection feature. 

On September 26, 2016, the Company
issued 1,374,000 shares of restricted common stock outside of the 2015 Equity Plan to Jay Nussbaum, Felicia Hess, Daniyel Erdberg,
Kendall Carpenter, Reginald Brown and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn pursuant to Stock Award Agreements. The shares will vest upon consummation
of a significant equity and/or debt financing from which the Company receives gross proceeds of at least $5,000,000 provided that
the holder remains engaged by the Company through the vesting date. Stock based compensation of $28,808 was recognized during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 

The Company issued 25,000 shares of
restricted common stock to a member of the Strategic Advisory Board for services which were immediately vested and recorded at
the fair market value of $82,722. 

On June 1, 2015, the Company issued
50,000 shares of restricted common stock with monthly vesting provisions to the Chairman of the Board for twenty-four months of
services pursuant to a Director Agreement. The Chairman can earn a pro rata portion of the shares, calculated on a twenty-four
month vesting period, in the event the Chairman relinquishes his position and Board seat prior to the expiration date of the Director
Agreement. The Company recognized a total of $202,500 expense for the portion of such shares earned by the Chairman during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

On
September 4, 2015, the Company issued 450,000 shares of restricted common stock to four management employees and one director
pursuant to stock award agreements. The shares will vest upon consummation of a $4,000,000 equity or debt financing provided that
the holder remains engaged by the Company through the vesting date. Stock based compensation of $604,440 was recognized during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 based on management s estimate that the shares would be fully vested by February
4, 2016, when the Board deemed vesting occurred with the issuance of $4,000,000 in common stock on November 20, 2015.  

8.   
         
        PREFERRED
    STOCK     

On
October 29, 2015, a 1:40 reverse split of the Company stock occurred and the effect has been applied retroactively for disclosure
purposes.  

All of the preferred stock of the Company
is convertible into common shares. The Series A and Series C stock conversion ratio is 1 to 2.5 common shares. The Series B, B-1,
D, E, F and G stock conversion ratio is 1 to 0.025 common shares. All preferred stock has voting rights equal to the number of
shares it would have on an  as if converted  basis subject to any ownership limitations governing such preferred shares.
All preferred stock is entitled to dividends rights equal to the number of shares it would have on an  as if converted 
basis. None of the preferred stock is redeemable, participating nor callable. 

The
Company analyzed the embedded conversion option for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815-15  Derivatives and
Hedging  and determined that the conversion option should be classified as equity.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, one investor who held Series A preferred stock converted a total of 1,000 shares of
Series A preferred stock for an aggregate of 2,500 shares of restricted common stock in accordance with their conversion rights
which includes a blocker with respect to individual ownership percentages. During the same period, two investors who held Series
C preferred stock converted a total of 73,387 shares of Series C for an aggregate of 183,468 shares of restricted common stock,
one investor who held Series D preferred stock converted a total of 2,000,000 shares of Series D for an aggregate of 50,000 shares

On
October 29, 2015, a 1:40 reverse split of the Company stock occurred and the effect has been applied retroactively for disclosure
purposes.  

On April 27, 2016, the Company issued
50,000 options from the 2015 Equity Plan to two employees for services provided. These options immediately vested and were granted
with an exercise price of $2.91, which was the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date, and expiration
date of April 27, 2019. 

On July 28, 2016, the Company issued
5,000 options from the 2015 Equity Plan to one employee as an employment bonus. These options were immediately vested and were
granted with an exercise price of $3.77, which was the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date, and

The
Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value on the date of grant of the 55,000 options granted
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
following table summarizes the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the 55,000 stock options granted during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 on the date of grant.   

Under
the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the fair value of the 55,000 options granted during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 is estimated at $107,941 on the date of grant. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $107,941 compensation expense
was recognized on these 55,000 options.  

During
2015, the Company granted 842,500 common stock options to employees and a director for service provided. Of those 842,500 options,
250,000 options immediately vested and were granted with an exercise price of $6.00 and expiration date of May 18, 2018. Another
105,000 options immediately vested and were granted with an exercise price of $5.00 and expiration date of December 10, 2018.

exercise price of $10.00 and expiration date of June 1, 2018. The second was for 125,000 shares with vesting tied to performance
and was granted with an exercise price of $10.00 and expiration date of June 1, 2018. These two director option awards were surrendered
and cancelled on September 4, 2015.   Stock based compensation was reversed for costs previously
recognized on the total 450,000 surrendered and cancelled unvested options. Another option award for 37,500 shares vesting over
three years was granted with an exercise price of $10.80 and expiration date of May 4, 2019.  

The
Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value on the date of grant of the 37,500 stock-based
awards that continue to vest during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

The
following table summarizes the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the 37,500 stock options granted during 2015 on
the date of grant:  

Under
the Black-Scholes option price model, fair value of the 37,500 options granted during 2015 is estimated at $293,954 on the date

        COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES     

On May 16, 2016, Banco Popular North
America ( Banco ) filed a lawsuit in Duval County, Florida in the Circuit Court of the Fourth Judicial Circuit against
Aerial Products Corporation d/b/a Southern Balloon Works ( Aerial Products ), Kevin M. Hess, LTAS, and the Company
to collect on a delinquent Small Business Administration loan that Banco made in 2007 to Aerial Products with Mr. Hess as the personal
guarantor. LTAS and the Company filed an Answer on June 30, 2016. It is the Company s position that neither LTAS nor the
Company are continuations of Aerial Products, and LTAS and the Company have denied all allegations made by Banco and will vigorously
defend that position. The Company has not recorded any contingent liability expense because the incurrence of loss is considered
remote. Settlement discussions between Mr. Hess and Banco are ongoing.

and Capital Resources    

As of September 30, 2016,
the Company had $3,619,470 in cash compared to $2,659,734 in cash at December 31, 2015, an increase of $959,736. As of September

We
have historically financed our operations through operating revenues and sales of equity and convertible debt securities to accredited
investors. While we currently believe we have sufficient capital and access to capital to continue our operations for the next
12 months, we can give no assurances regarding our future liquidity. We may incur significant expenses in implementing our growth
plan, and we could deplete our cash and working capital more rapidly than expected, which could result in our need to curtail
our operations.  

Sources
and Uses of Cash   

Operating
Activities   

Net
cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,991,165, which was an increase in operating

paid to satisfy the delinquent Oklahoma Technology Commercialization Center loan. Financing activities during the first nine months
of 2015 were comprised of cash proceeds totaling $985,725 from issuance of Series G preferred stock. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that materially effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

The
Company s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Financial Statements included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 4,
2016. As disclosed therein, the preparation of the Company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The Company
believes that the following discussion addresses the Company s most critical accounting policies, which are those that are
most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s
most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.  

Accounts
Receivable and Credit Policies :   

Trade
accounts receivable consist of amounts due from the sale of tethered aerostats, refurbishments, accessories, spare parts and delivery
and installation of aerostats.  Accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade
terms requiring payment within 30 days of receipt of the invoice.  The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts
equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade
accounts receivable.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company deemed no accounts receivable as uncollectible.  

Revenue
Recognition and Unearned Revenue :   

The
Company recognizes revenue when all four of the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2)
delivery has occurred and title has transferred or services have been rendered; 3) our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable;
and 4) collectability is reasonably assured. We record unearned revenue as a liability and the associated costs of sales as work
in process inventory. There is a balance of $2,210 in accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 for sales on account and no balance
in unearned revenue.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments :   

The
Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify
as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument
is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported
in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing
model, in accordance with ASC 815-15  Derivative and Hedging  to value the derivative instruments at inception and
on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded
as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified
in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could
be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the Company s financial statements.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK   

As
a smaller reporting company, as that term is defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information
required by this Item.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

(a)
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.   

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls
and procedures relative to their costs.  

Based
on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September
30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.  

(b)
Changes in internal control over financial reporting.   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Except
as discussed below, we are not currently aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.  

Banco
Popular North America. v Aerial Products Corporation d/b/a Southern Balloon Works, et al. (Fourth Judicial Circuit Court, Duval
County Florida-Civil Division) Case No. 16:2016:CA-003343   

On
May 16, 2016, Banco Popular North America ( Banco ) filed a lawsuit in Duval County, Florida in the Circuit Court
of the Fourth Judicial Circuit against Aerial Products, Kevin M. Hess, LTAS and the Company to collect on a delinquent Small Business
Administration loan that Banco made in 2007 to Aerial Products with Mr. Hess as the personal guarantor. LTAS and the Company filed
an Answer on June 30, 2016. It is our position that neither LTAS nor the Company are continuations of Aerial Products and we have
denied all allegations made by Banco and will vigorously defend that position. The Company has not recorded any contingent liability
expense because the incurrence of loss is considered remote. Settlement discussions between Mr. Hess and Banco are ongoing.  

Other
than as set forth above, there are no material claims, actions, suits, proceedings, inquiries, labor disputes or investigations
pending.

2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   

The Company issued a total
of 1,895,667 shares of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as described below: 

On
                                         September 29, 2016, the Company issued 496,667 shares of restricted common stock to twelve
                                         investors that were party to the November 2015 private placement, pursuant to the purchase
                                         agreement for such private placement. These investors purchased stock at $5.00 per share
                                         and under the purchase agreement, received twelve months of price protection. The Convertible
                                         Promissory Notes Series 2016 due October 1, 2017 included a $3.00 per share conversion
                                         factor, thereby triggering the price protection feature.    

The
                                         Company issued 1,374,000 shares of restricted common stock outside of the 2015 Equity
                                         Plan to Jay Nussbaum, Felicia Hess, Daniyel Erdberg, Kendall Carpenter, Reginald Brown
                                         and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn pursuant to Stock Award Agreements. The shares will vest upon
                                         consummation of a significant equity and/or debt financing of at least $5,000,000 provided
                                         that the holder remains engaged by the Company through the vesting date. Stock-based
                                         compensation of $28,808 was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016    

The
                                         Company issued 25,000 shares of restricted common stock to a member of the Strategic
                                         Advisory Board for services which were immediately vested and recorded at the fair market
                                         value of $82,750.     

The
securities referenced above were offered and sold solely to  accredited investors  in reliance on the exemption from
registration afforded by Rule 506 of Regulation D and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not
