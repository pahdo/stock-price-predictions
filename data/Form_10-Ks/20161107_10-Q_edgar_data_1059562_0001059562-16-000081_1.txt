1. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
       
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.  The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In the opinion of management, all recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement have been included.  Operating results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in the  Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, of LMI Aerospace, Inc. (the "Company , "us", "we", "our") for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 17, 2016. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
    
  Recent Accounting Standards 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  On July 9, 2015 the FASB voted to approve a one year delay of the effective date and to permit companies to voluntarily adopt the new standard as of the original effective date.  The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, and will provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.  The standard requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application.  The provisions of this new guidance are effective as of the beginning of the Company s first quarter of 2018.  The Company has engaged external subject-matter experts and continues to evaluate the transition method to be used and the impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases."  The standard requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The new standard  also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. The provisions of this new guidance are effective as of the beginning of the Company s first quarter of 2019. This new standard will be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," which amends Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation.  The standard requires excess tax benefits or deficiencies for share-based payments be recorded in the period shares vest as income tax expense or benefit, rather than within Additional Paid-in Capital. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will be included in operating activities and will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity. As the Company carries a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, we do not expect that this standard will have a material impact on our financial statements.  The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted.  The Company plans to adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2017.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." The guidance addresses the classification of cash flow related to (1) debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance, including bank-owned life insurance, (6) distributions received from equity method investees and (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions. The guidance also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The guidance will generally be applied retrospectively and is effective for financial statements issued for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated statement of cash flows. 
  All other issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements are not expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  

2. 
    Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value 
       
  Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  A fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 
    
           Level 1: 
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
              Level 2: 
    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
              Level 3: 
    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
       
  The asset or liability s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  There have been no changes in the methodologies used at   September 30, 2016  .  There were no transfers between levels during 2016 and 2015. 
   
 (1) The fair value of goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, a triggering event occurred that required the Company to perform an interim impairment analysis for the goodwill and intangible assets within the Engineering Services reporting unit. This analysis determined the related goodwill and intangible assets were impaired and a loss of   $28,368   was recorded in the quarter.

(1)  The Company performed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2015 and determined no adjustments to the carrying value were necessary. 

3. 
    Accounts Receivable, Net 
       
  Accounts receivable, net consists of the following: 

Under contract accounting, unbilled revenues arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date.  Included in unbilled revenue at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are   $872   and   $858  , respectively, related to unpriced change orders or claims that are subject to negotiation.  The final resolution of these unpriced items could result in either a favorable or unfavorable change in the revenue recognized to date on the associated contracts. 
    
  Accounts receivable expected to be collected after one year is not material. 
    
  The Company records changes in contract estimates using the cumulative catch-up method in accordance with the Revenue Recognition topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Cumulative catch-up adjustments had the following impacts to operating income for the periods presented: 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had recognized a loss reserve of   $2,154   and   $1,992  , respectively, on the Mitsubishi Regional Jet design-build program.  Adjustments related to this program were recorded as a reduction to revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 

4. 
    Inventories 
       
  Inventories consist of the following:

  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except share and per share data) 
  (Unaudited) 
  September 30, 2016 

Inventories include capitalized contract costs relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles.  The Company believes these amounts will be fully recovered over the life of the contracts.  In accordance with ASC 605-35-45-1 2, the provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are accounted for as additional contract cost and recognized as part of cost of sales.  Provisions for losses are recorded as a reduction of related contract costs recorded in inventory.  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company had no contracts with loss reserves accounted for as a reduction of inventory. 
    
  Capitalized contract costs at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 include   $5,522   and   $5,970   respectively, related to an agreement the Company signed with Spirit Aerosystems ("Spirit".)  This agreement extended the performance period of the statements of work for certain contracts with Spirit and gave the Company preferred supplier status on certain future contracts.  This consideration is being amortized as a reduction to revenue over the life of the related contracts.  The remaining capitalized contract costs relate primarily to four early-stage long-term contracts.  The Company expects these costs will not be realized within one year but believes these amounts will be fully recovered over the life of the related contracts. 
    
  The following table illustrates the market to which capitalized contract cost at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 related:  

5. 
    Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
       
  Goodwill 
    
  The following table summarizes the net carrying amount of goodwill by segment at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively: 

The carrying value of goodwill is assessed annually, during the fourth quarter, unless a triggering event occurs. Following an assessment, an impairment charge is recorded if appropriate.  A triggering event did not occur in the third quarter of 2016 that would require the Company to perform an impairment evaluation.

  September 30, 2016 

In the second quarter of 2016, the Company significantly downgraded the full-year 2016 sales and operating income forecast for its Engineering Services business due to continued decline in demand.  This downward adjustment to the forecast, combined with lower than expected operating results for the second quarter of 2016, was deemed to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment evaluation for the Engineering Services reporting unit in accordance with ASC 350. The interim step one analysis performed, which used a combination of discounted cash flows and market value approaches to determine the fair value of the Engineering Services reporting unit, indicated the fair value was less than the carrying value of its net assets. The required step two valuation analysis, prepared as of June 30, 2016, indicated that the   $24,302   of goodwill related to Engineering Services was fully impaired. The resulting impairment charge was recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and is reflected in the Engineering Services segment within the Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Intangible Assets 
    
  Intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks and customer intangibles.  The carrying values were as follows: 

Intangibles amortization expense was   $796   and   $1,089   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $2,868   and   $3,269   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The accumulated amortization balances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were   $778   and   $778   for trademarks,   $29,636   and   $22,816   for customer intangible assets, and   $981   and   $867   for other intangible assets.  
    
  In conjunction with the interim impairment analysis conducted during the current-year as discussed above, the Company also evaluated the recoverability of the customer intangible assets related to the Engineering Services reporting unit under ASC 360.  As a result of this analysis, an impairment charge of   $4,066   was recognized in the Engineering Services segment within the Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Intangible assets related to the acquisition of Valent Aerostructures, LLC are amortized on the straight-line method as this approximates the pattern of economic benefit of each intangible asset.  All other remaining intangible assets are not material.

6. 
    Long-term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations 
       
  Long-term debt and capital lease obligations consist of the following: 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $224,175   in outstanding second-priority senior secured notes maturing on July 15, 2019.  The Company records these notes at cost.  The fair value of these notes, based on the last market price transaction in the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of 1.0075, was   $225,856  .  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased and retired   $10,000   of the outstanding notes at a premium of 1.01875 plus accrued interest.  Obligations under these notes are secured by substantially all of the Company s assets and bear interest at   7.375%  , paid semi-annually in January and July. 
    
  The Company's revolving credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to   $90,000  .  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $10,000   in outstanding borrowings under the facility.  Under the agreement, the co-collateral agents may establish a reserve against the facility.  At   September 30, 2016  , the reserve established was   $15,000  , which reduced the maximum availability to   $75,000  .  Based on the amount of eligible assets at   September 30, 2016   and outstanding letters of credit of   $1,525  ,  available borrowings were further reduced to   $44,291  .    The maximum amount, less reserves, available for borrowing at levels below $30,000 is based on a sum of 45% of eligible receivables, 30% of eligible inventories and an additional amount of eligible equipment up to 20% of total borrowings under the facility.  The maximum amount, less reserves, available for borrowing at levels above $30,000 is based on a sum of 75% of eligible receivables, 45% of eligible inventories and an additional amount of eligible equipment up to 20% of total borrowings under the facility.    Borrowings under the facility are secured by a first lien on substantially all of the Company s assets and bear interest at either the LIBOR rate plus a margin of   3.00%    to   3.50%   or the alternate base rate, which is the highest of the following plus a margin of    2.00%   to   2.50%  , respectively, with the applicable margins for the revolving credit facility subject to a grid based on the average availability ratio of the Company for the most recently completed quarter: 
    
     Prime rate, 
     Federal funds rate plus   0.5%  , or, 
     The adjusted Eurodollar rate for an interest period of one month plus   1.0%  . 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the actual interest rate incurred for the revolving credit facility was   5.8%   on average outstanding borrowings of   $1,821  . 
    
  The Company is required to pay a commitment fee of between   0.375%   and   0.5%   per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, depending on the average revolver usage during the period as compared to the total available borrowings under the facility.   At   September 30, 2016  , the commitment fee was   0.5%  .

The revolving credit facility matures on the earlier of July 15, 2019 or the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the senior secured notes unless the notes are repaid, refinanced or otherwise satisfied in full.  The maturity dates are subject to acceleration upon occurrence of an event of default.  An event of default under the revolving credit agreement includes, among other things, failure to pay any material indebtedness, acceleration of payments by any lender prior to scheduled maturity, or judgments rendered against the Company requiring payments at or above certain levels. 
    
  The credit agreement contains a covenant that requires us to comply with a maximum first priority debt to EBITDA ratio on a quarterly basis.  In addition, the agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants that limit and in some circumstances prohibit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, sell, lease or transfer our assets, make investments, guarantee debt or obligations, create liens, and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganization transactions.  These restrictive covenants prohibit the Company from paying dividends.  These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand any current or future downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, any of which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt and are not subject to such restrictions. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants and expects to be in compliance with its covenants in future periods.  If the Company fails to meet any covenants in the credit agreement, the Company would not be in compliance with the credit agreement and the lenders would be entitled to exercise various rights, including causing the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility to become immediately due and payable.   

7. 
    Earnings Per Common Share 
       
  Basic net income per common share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted net income per common share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including the dilutive effect of restricted stock, using the treasury stock method.  The following table shows a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. 

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   81,734   restricted shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. These securities could be dilutive in future periods.

    Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements 

LMI Aerospace, Inc. excluding its subsidiaries ( LMIA ) is the parent company, issuer and obligor of the second-priority senior notes due July 15, 2019 (the  Notes ).  The payment obligations of LMIA under the Notes are guaranteed and secured by LMIA and all of its subsidiaries other than minor subsidiaries as further described below. 
    
  These Notes are guaranteed on a second-priority senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by LMIA ( Guarantor Parent ) and all of its existing and future 100% owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Guarantor Subsidiaries ) other than minor subsidiaries.  Such guaranties are full and unconditional.  LMIA conducts substantially all of its business through and derives virtually all of its income from its subsidiaries.  Therefore, its ability to make required principal and interest payments with respect to its indebtedness depends on the earnings of subsidiaries and its ability to receive funds from its subsidiaries. 
    
  The Notes are secured on a second-priority basis by liens on substantially all of LMIA s and the Guarantor Subsidiaries  assets, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. The liens securing the Notes are contractually subordinated to the liens that secure indebtedness under the revolving credit facility as a result of the lien subordination provisions of the intercreditor agreement to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness as well as being subordinated by other existing indebtedness, including industrial revenue bonds, capital leases and other notes payable, to the extent of the value of the collateral that secures such existing indebtedness.  As a consequence of this lien subordination and existing indebtedness the notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to the extent of the value of the collateral that secures them.  Decisions regarding the maintenance and release of the collateral secured by the collateral agreement are made by the lenders under the modified revolving credit facility, and neither the indenture trustee nor the holders of the Notes have control of decisions regarding the release of collateral. 
  We have not presented separate financial statements and separate disclosures have not been provided concerning the Guarantor Subsidiaries due to the presentation of condensed consolidating financial information set forth in this Note, consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) rules governing reporting on guarantor financial information.

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
       
  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a  safe harbor  for forward-looking statements. The Company makes forward-looking statements in the  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which represent the Company s expectations or beliefs about future events and financial performance.  When used in this report, the words  expect,   believe,   anticipate,   goal,   plan,   intend,   estimate,   may,   will  or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or results.  Such statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those referred to under  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Form 10-K ) and otherwise described in the Company s periodic filings and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). 
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur.  In addition, actual results could differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements.  Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.  Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Investors should, however, review additional disclosures made by the Company from time to time in its periodic filings with the SEC. 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read completely, in conjunction with our   2015   Form 10-K, as amended, and with the understanding that the Company s actual future results may be materially different from what the Company expects.  All forward-looking statements made by the Company in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company s other filings with the SEC are qualified by these cautionary statements. 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions.  (See Note 1 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.) 
    
  The Company believes that certain significant accounting estimates have the potential to have a more significant impact on the financial statements either because of the significance of the financial statements to which they relate or because they involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.  A summary of such critical accounting estimates can be found in the section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  contained in the   2015   Form 10-K, as amended. 
   
  Overview 
    
  We are a leading supplier of structural assemblies, kits and components and design engineering services to the aerospace and defense markets.  We primarily sell our products and services to the large commercial, corporate and regional, and military aircraft markets.    We believe that OEMs and Tier 1 aerospace companies will continue the trend of selecting their suppliers based upon the breadth of more complex and sophisticated design and manufacturing capabilities and value-added services and the ability of their suppliers to manage large production programs. 
    
  The Company is organized into two reportable segments: the Aerostructures segment and the Engineering Services segment.  Through its Aerostructures segment, the Company primarily fabricates, machines, finishes, integrates, assembles and kits formed close tolerance aluminum, specialty alloy and composite components and higher level assemblies for use by the aerospace and defense industries. This segment manufactures more than 40,000 products for integration into a variety of aircraft platforms manufactured by leading original equipment manufacturers and Tier 1 aerospace suppliers. Through its Engineering Services segment, the Company provides a complete range of design, engineering and program management services, supporting aircraft product lifecycles from conceptual design, analysis and certification through production support, fleet support and service life extensions via a complete turnkey engineering solution.  
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company significantly downgraded the full-year 2016 sales and operating income forecast for its Engineering Services business due to continued decline in demand.  This downward adjustment to the forecast, combined with lower than expected operating results for the second quarter of 2016, led the Company to conduct an interim impairment test.  This analysis resulted in the Company recording a goodwill impairment charge of $24.3 million and an intangible asset impairment charge of $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2016.  This non-cash impairment charge is not expected to result in any impact to the Company's liquidity, future operations or ability to comply with its debt covenants.  
   
  Results of Operations 
    
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to three months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Consolidated Operations 
    
  Cost of goods sold for the Aerostructures segment consists primarily of direct labor, materials, subcontract costs and manufacturing overhead, including indirect labor costs, depreciation, rent, supplies and other indirect costs.  Cost of goods for the Engineering Services segment consists primarily of direct labor, subcontract costs and overhead, including rent, maintenance, and indirect costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for both segments consist primarily of labor, rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services and other administrative expenses.

     Table of Contents  

The following table is a summary of the Company's operating results for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

Aerostructures Segment 
    
  Net Sales.    Net sales were   $80.4 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , a   5.5%     decrease   from   $85.1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The following table specifies the amount of the Aerostructures segment s net sales by category for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015   and the percentage of the segment s total net sales for each period represented by each category: 

Net sales of large commercial aircraft products   increased     4.7%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   when compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The most significant increase in revenue in the category was attributable to sales on the Bombardier C-Series platform which contributed $2.1 million in additional sales volume when compared to the prior-year period.  Increased content and higher production rates on the Boeing 787 platform, which generated $8.1 million in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to $7.0 million in the   third   quarter of   2015  , also contributed to the increase in sales.  We expect the Bombardier C-Series and Boeing 787 platforms to generate similar levels of revenue throughout 2016.  These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decline in sales on the Boeing 747 platform to $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $2.7 million in the   third   quarter of 2015. 
    
  Net sales of components for corporate and regional aircraft decreased   19.9%   during the   third   quarter of   2016  . The decline in sales in the corporate and regional jet market was primarily attributable to lower tooling demand of $3.1 million on the Gulfstream G500/600 program and lower overall demand of $2.5 million on the Gulfstream G450/550 program, from $5.5 million and $6.1 million, respectively, in the   third   quarter of 2015 to $2.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively in the third quarter of 2016.  Sales on a new Honda Jet program partially offset these decreases and contributed $1.5 million in the   third   quarter of 2016. 

27 

     Table of Contents  

Net sales of military products decreased   1.1%   during the   third   quarter of   2016  .  The decrease is primarily due to a $0.7 million reduction in revenue on the Sikorsky Blackhawk program which was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in sales on the Boeing Apache program in the   third   quarter of 2016 when compared to the   third   quarter of 2015.  
    
  Cost of Goods Sold.     Cost of goods sold for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $65.7 million   compared to   $68.5 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The reduction in cost of goods sold in the third quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to lower sales volume and a $0.6 million reduction in incentive compensation expense. 
    
  Gross Profit.    Gross profit for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $14.7 million   (  18.3%   of net sales) compared to   $16.6 million   (  19.5%   of net sales) in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The reduction in gross profit margin in the second quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to lower sales and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation expense of $0.6 million and benefits realized from restructuring and cost savings activities completed during 2015. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.    Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $9.0 million   (  11.2%   of net sales) for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $7.7 million   (  9.0%   of net sales) for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The change in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a net gain of $3.3 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to the settlement of a lawsuit.  In addition, incentive compensation costs and salaries and related fringes were lower in the third quarter of 2016 by $0.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively, when compared to the prior-year period.  
    
  Engineering Services Segment 
    
  Net Sales.    The Engineering Services segment generates revenue primarily through the billing of employee time spent on customer projects.  Net sales for the Engineering Services segment were   $9.5 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to   $10.8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  , a decrease of   12.0%  .  The following table specifies the amount of the Engineering Services segment s net sales by category for the   third   quarter in each of   2016   and   2015   and the percentage of the segment s total net sales represented by each category. 

Net sales of services for large commercial aircraft were   $3.0 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   down     53.1%   from   $6.4 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The   decrease   in this category was primarily attributable to the completion of the Bombardier C-series program in the first quarter of 2016, which contributed $1.8 million of revenue in the   third   quarter of   2015   compared to no revenue in the   third   quarter of   2016  .   In addition, sales related to maintenance and repair services declined to $2.8 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to $4.0 million in the   third   quarter of 2015. 
    
  Net sales of services related to corporate and regional aircraft were   $2.8 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $0.8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  ,   up     250.0%  .  The change in revenue was primarily related to an unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustment of $1.9 million on the Mitsubishi Regional Jet program in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Revenue on the Bombardier Global 7000/8000 program increased $1.0 million to $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $0.5 million in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The Aerion AS2 program contributed $0.6 million in the   third   quarter of   2015   compared to $0.1 million in the   third   quarter of   2016  .   
    
  Net sales of services for military programs were   $2.9 million   in both the   third   quarter of   2016   and the   third   quarter of   2015  .   
    
  Net sales of services related to the design and delivery of tooling on various programs supporting commercial and military aircraft were   $0.8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $0.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .

Cost of Goods Sold.    Cost of goods sold for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $8.3 million   compared to   $10.8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .    The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to reductions in direct labor, indirect labor and related fringe benefits totaling $2.2 million resulting from lower demand for this segment and cost reduction activities completed in 2015. 
    
  Gross Profit.    Gross profit for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $1.2 million   (  12.6%   of net sales) compared to   $0.0 million   (  0.0%   of net sales) in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The change in gross profit was attributable to the unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustment of $1.9 million recorded the third quarter of 2015.  
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.    Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $1.1 million  , or   11.6%   of net sales, compared to   $2.8 million  , or   25.9%   of net sales, for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to restructuring expenses of $1.2 million incurred in the third quarter of 2015 associated with the closure of the Company's Greenville, South Carolina and Melbourne, Australia offices and the elimination of other management positions within the segment.  In addition, lower intangible asset amortization and salary and wage expenses of $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, contributed to the reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the prior-year period.  
    
  Non-segment Expenses 
    
  Interest Expense.    Interest expense decreased to   $5.6 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $5.7 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The reduction in interest expense was attributable to lower average borrowings and was partially offset by a $0.2 million write-off of debt issuance cost related to the retirement of certain of the outstanding senior secured notes during the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Income Tax Expense.    During the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Company recorded an income tax benefit of    $0.2 million   compared to income expense of   $0.2 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .

Aerostructures Segment 
    
  Net Sales.    Net sales were   $232.9 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , a   6.7%     decrease   from   $249.7 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The following table specifies the amount of the Aerostructures segment s net sales by category for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015   and the percentage of the segment s total net sales for each period represented by each category: 

Net sales of large commercial aircraft products   increased     4.0%   in the first   nine   months of   2016   when compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . The most significant increase in revenue in the category was attributable to sales on the Bombardier C-Series platform which contributed $5.5 million in additional sales volume when compared to the prior-year period.  Increased content and higher production rates on the Boeing 787 platform, which generated $24.8 million in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to $20.9 million in the first   nine   months of   2015  , also contributed to the increase in sales.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales on the Boeing 747 platform from $9.1 million in the first   nine   months of   2015   to $4.2 million in the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
    
  Net sales of components for corporate and regional aircraft   decreased     19.3%   during the first   nine   months of   2016  .  The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to overall sales on the Gulfstream G450/G550 and tooling on the G500/600 programs, which generated sales of $19.3 million and $9.5 million, respectively, in the first   nine   months of   2015   compared to $10.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively, in the first   nine   months of 2016. 
    
  Net sales of military products   decreased     13.6%   during the first   nine   months of   2016  .  The decrease is primarily due to reductions in revenue on the Boeing F-18 and Lockheed Martin F-35 programs of $1.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, from $3.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in the first   nine   months of   2015   to $1.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in the first   nine   months of   2016  .  Sales on the Sikorsky Blackhawk program also declined from $14.4 million in the first   nine   months of   2015   to $13.2 million in the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
    
  Cost of Goods Sold.     Cost of goods sold for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $188.7 million   compared to   $200.2 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . The reduction in cost of goods sold in the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes, a reduction in incentive compensation expense of $1.4 million and the benefits of lower manufacturing overhead expenses realized from cost savings initiatives implemented in prior periods. 
    
  Gross Profit.    Gross profit for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $44.2 million   (  19.0%   of net sales) compared to   $49.5 million   (  19.8%   of net sales) in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  Unfavorable product mix and the impact of lower sales contributed to the reduction in gross profit margin in the first   nine   months of 2016.  This decline in gross profit margin was partially offset by benefits

realized from restructuring and cost savings activities completed during 2015 and 2016 in addition to lower incentive compensation costs of $1.4 million. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.    Selling, general and administrative expenses were   $31.0 million   (  13.3%   of net sales) for the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared to   $29.5 million   (  11.8%   of net sales) for the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The change in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a net gain of $3.3 million recorded in the first nine months of 2015 related to the settlement of a lawsuit.  In addition, incentive compensation costs and salaries and related fringes were lower in the first nine months of 2016 by $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively, when compared to the prior-year period.  
    
  Engineering Services Segment 
    
  Net Sales.    The Engineering Services segment generates revenue primarily through the billing of employee time spent on customer projects.  Net sales for the Engineering Services segment were   $29.2 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   36.8 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , a   decrease   of   20.7%  .  The following table specifies the amount of the Engineering Services segment s net sales by category for the first   nine   months in each of   2016   and   2015   and the percentage of the segment s total net sales represented by each category. 

Net sales of services for large commercial aircraft were   $10.5 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   down     37.1%   from   $16.7 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease in this category is partially attributable to a decline in sales related to maintenance and repair services, which contributed $11.4 million in revenue for the first   nine   months of   2015   compared to $8.8 million in revenue for the first   nine   months of   2016  .   In addition, revenues on the Bombardier C-series and Boeing 747 programs decreased to $1.2 million and $0.0 million, respectively, in the first   nine   months of 2016 from $4.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively in the first   nine   months of 2015.   
    
  Net sales of services related to corporate and regional aircraft were   $9.7 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared to   $10.6 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  ,   a decrease   of   8.5%  .  The decrease in this category was primarily attributable to the Aerion AS2 program, which contributed revenue of $0.6 million in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to $2.1 million in the first nine months of   2015  .  Sales on the Arrowhead Global Wing program contributed $1.1 million in the first   nine   months of 2015 and was completed in that year.  Revenues in the first   nine   months of   2015   were impacted by an unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment of $1.9 million. 
    
  Net sales of services for military programs were $  7.6 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to $  7.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  In the first nine months of 2015 the Lockheed Martin HAVOC and the Bell V280 programs contributed revenues of $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively.  These programs were completed in 2015.  These decreases in revenue were partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million on a new military trainer program. 
    
  Net sales of services related to design and delivery of tooling on various programs supporting commercial and military aircraft were   $1.4 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to $  1.6 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . This decrease is primarily related to tooling sales on various Boeing programs which declined $0.2 million in the first   nine   months of   2016   when compared to the prior-year period. 
    
  Cost of Goods Sold.    Cost of goods sold for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $25.5 million   compared to   $33.7 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  .    The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to reductions in direct labor, indirect labor and related fringe benefits of $7.6 million resulting from lower demand for this segment and cost reduction activities completed in 2015.

Gross Profit.    Gross profit for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $3.7 million   (  12.7%   of net sales) compared to   $3.1 million   (  8.4%   of net sales) in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The change in gross profit was attributable to the unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustment of $1.9 million recorded the first nine months of 2015. The decline in sales the first nine months of 2016 contributed to the lower gross profit dollars but was partially offset by a decline in wages and related expenses resulting from cost reduction activities completed in 2015. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.    Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $32.3 million  , or   110.6%   of net sales, compared to   $6.9 million  , or   18.8%   of net sales, for the first   nine   months of   2015  .  The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $24.3 million charge for goodwill impairment and a $4.1 million charge for intangible asset impairment.  These charges were partially offset by a decline in restructuring expenses of $1.3 million and salary and related expenses of $1.1 million in the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the prior-year period.  These decreases in expense relate to cost reduction activities completed in 2015.  Excluding the impairment and restructuring charges, selling, general, and administrative expenses were lower in the first nine month of 2016 by $1.6 million when compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
    
  Non-segment Expenses 
    
  Interest Expense.    Interest expense decreased to   $16.1 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   from   $16.8 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , the result of lower outstanding borrowings.   
    
  Income Tax Expense.    During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Company recorded an income tax benefit of    $0.7 million   compared to an expense of   $0.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  Income taxes in the first nine months of 2016 were favorably impacted by $0.5 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in our Engineering Services reporting unit.  Income tax expense in the first nine months of 2015 includes the recognition of a $0.5 million adjustment resulting from an audit of the Company's 2012 and 2013 tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  When viewed with the financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and accompanying reconciliations, the Company believes earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) and Adjusted EBITDA provide additional useful information to clarify and enhance the understanding of the factors and trends affecting past performance and future prospects. The Company defines these measures, explains how they are calculated and provides reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in the tables below. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this Form 10-Q, are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP.  They are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to net cash provided by operating activities as measures of liquidity.  The presentation of these measures should not be interpreted to mean that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. 
    
  The Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP operating performance measures internally as complementary financial measures to evaluate the performance and trends of the business.  The Company presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes that measures such as these provide useful information with respect to its ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and overall operating performance. 
    
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company s results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are: 
             
    They do not reflect the Company s cash expenditures, future expenditures for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
                
    They do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; 
                
    They do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; 
                
    Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 

32 

     Table of Contents  

They are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the statement of cash flows; 
                
    They do not reflect the impact on earnings of charges resulting from matters unrelated to ongoing operations; and 
                
    Other companies in the Company s industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
       
  Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and the related financial ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to the Company to invest in the growth of the business or as a measure of cash that will be available to meet the Company s obligations.  Furthermore, the definitions of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA calculated here are different than those contained in the Company s credit agreement.  You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementary. 
    
  However, in spite of the above stated limitations, the Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to an investor in evaluating the results of operations because these measures: 
             
    Are widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such terms, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors; 
                
    Help investors to evaluate and compare the results of operations from period to period by removing the effect of the capital structure from operating performance; and 
                
    Are used by the management team for various other purposes in presentations to the Board of Directors as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. 
       
  Adjusted EBITDA excludes acquisition and integration charges, as applicable, and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of the businesses apart from other non cash and non-recurring expenses, as well as interest and tax expense. 
    
  The following financial items have been added back to net income when calculating EBITDA: 
             
    Interest expense; 
                
    Income tax expense; 
                
    Goodwill and intangible asset impairment; 
                
    Depreciation; and 
                
    Amortization. 
       
  The following additional financial items have been added back to net income when calculating Adjusted EBITDA: 
             
    Stock-based compensation; 
                
    Integration related expenses; 
                
    Restructuring expenses; 
                
    Other (net).

Reconciliations of net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were as follows: 

(1) 
    Includes amortization of intangibles, amortization of long-term supply agreement consideration and depreciation expense. 
              (2) 
    An interim impairment evaluation for the Engineering Services reporting unit resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $24.3 million and an intangible asset impairment charge of $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
              (3) 
    Includes shared-based expense associated with the LMI Aerospace, Inc. 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan, the LMI Aerospace, Inc. 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan and the LMI Profit Sharing and Savings Plan.  The three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 also includes share-based expense associated with the Valent Aerostructures, LLC 401(k) Plan.  In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2015 include expenses associated with share-based payments to settle obligations under a consulting agreement.  
              (4) 
    Includes expenses related to general employment separation activities.  The nine months ended September 30, 2015 also include expenses related to the closure of the Company's St. Louis machining facility.  The three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 also include expenses related to the closure of the Company's Coweta, OK, Greenville, SC and Melbourne, Australia facilities.  The three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 also include expenses related to the closure of the Company's Wichita sheet-metal operations. 
              (5) 
    In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a net gain of $3.3 million related to a legal settlement.  The gain realized from the settlement offsets expenses of $1.9 million that were recorded as a favorable adjustment to EBITDA when incurred in prior quarters.  For consistency, the above table reflects only $1.9 million of the net gain as an unfavorable EBITDA adjustment. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's primary source of outstanding indebtedness was second priority senior secured notes that mature in July of 2019.  These notes accrue interest at 7.375% and require semi-annual interest payments.  The Company believes that cash generated from operations combined with its cash and cash equivalent assets, in addition to available borrowings under its revolving credit facility, will provide the financial flexibility necessary to achieve its long-range strategic goals.  For more information on the Company's debt structure, please see Note 5 - Long-term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , the Company's operating activities used cash of   $0.3 million   and provided cash of    $5.7 million  , respectively.  Net cash used by operating activities for the first   nine   months of 2016 was unfavorably impacted by an increase of   $6.5 million   in accounts receivable related to the timing of customer payments.  Inventory also increased in the first nine months by   $9.5 million  , as the Company prepares for anticipated higher demand in subsequent quarters.  We expect inventory to decline in the fourth quarter of 2016.  In addition, in the first nine months of 2016, the Company made both payments totaling $17.3 million for the semi-annual interest due on its outstanding notes.  Operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2016 was favorably impacted by an increase in accounts payable of   $9.0 million  , primarily due to the growth in inventory and the timing of vendor payments. 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the first   nine   months of   2015   was unfavorably impacted by a $6.5 million payment of cash consideration to a key customer.  In exchange for this payment,  the performance period of the statements of work for certain contracts with this customer was extended and the Company was granted preferred supplier status on certain future contracts.  In the first nine months of 2015, the Company made interest payments of $19.4 million associated with its outstanding notes. 
    
  Net cash used for investing activities was   $7.6 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared to   $15.0 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  .  Capital spending in the first   nine   months of 2016 included $2.1 million of purchases to support our increasing content on the Boeing 737 MAX platform at our Washington, Missouri manufacturing facility.  Capital spending in the first   nine   months of 2015 primarily related to the purchase of machinery and equipment to support production contracts in addition to the purchase of equipment for environmental compliance at our Cuba, Missouri plant.  
    
  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company borrowed $1.5 million to fund equipment purchases at our Washington, Missouri facility in support of the Boeing 737 MAX program.  In addition, the Company made principal payments of $2.1 million on outstanding debt and used $10.0 million in borrowings on its revolving credit facility to retire higher-rate senior notes.  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company borrowed $4.0 million on its revolving credit facility to fund operating and investing activities, primarily the semi-annual interest on outstanding senior notes and capital purchases, and made principal payments on other long-term debt of $1.8 million. 
    
  The Company, in the ordinary course of business, evaluates strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.  These strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase stockholder value.  We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed.  The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Restricted Stock   Agreement: #XXX 
  Fair value per share on   Grant Date XX/XX/XXXX -   $XX.XX 
  THE RESTRICTED SHARES AWARDED UNDER THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENTARE SUBJECT TO A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF FORFEITURE UNTIL VESTED. 
  LMI AEROSPACE, INC. 
  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT 
           TO: 
     XXXXXX 
       
  For the purposes set forth in the LMI Aerospace, Inc. (the "Company") 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Plan"), you have been awarded by the Committee   shares in words   (XXXXX) shares   of the common stock of the Company, $0.02 par value per share (the "Restricted Shares"), which award (the "Award") is subject to and conditioned upon your acceptance of this Restricted Stock Award Agreement (this "Agreement"). 
    
  The terms of the Award are as set forth in this Agreement and in the Plan. The Plan is incorporated into this Agreement by reference, which means that this Agreement is limited by and subject to the express terms and provisions of the Plan. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Plan. The more salient terms of the Award are summarized as follows: 
  1.        Grant Date:        XX/XX/XXXX      (the  Grant Date ) 
    
  2.        Number of Restricted Shares Subject to this Award  :   XXXXX   (the  Restricted Shares ) 
    
  3.        Vesting Provisions.     
    
  (a)    Subject to the terms and conditions herein, (i)   XXXXX     of the Restricted Shares (the  Milestone Shares ) shall remain unvested and restricted unless and until both the Company achieves one or more of the milestones referenced in   Exhibit A   (the  Milestones ) as assessed by the Committee following the end of the fiscal year   XXXX   and you have not experienced a Termination Event (as defined below) by the end of such fiscal year, and (ii) the remaining   XXXXX   of the Restricted Shares (the  Time Shares ) shall remain unvested and restricted unless and until the period of time commencing on the Grant Date and ending at the close of business on   XXXX     XX, XXXX   (the  Time Period ) expires without you experiencing a Termination Event. 

(b)    In furtherance of and without limiting the authority of the Committee to adjust the terms of the Award pursuant to Section 17 of the Plan, the Committee may adjust the vesting requirements of this Award to account for any of the events identified in such Section. 
    
  (c)    If one or more of the Milestones have been met and you have not experienced a Termination Event during the Time Period, then the number of the Restricted Shares associated with the Milestones that have been met as set forth in   Exhibit A   shall vest and become unrestricted for purposes of vesting hereunder. A  Termination Event  means the termination of your status as an Employee of the Company and its Affiliates for any reason other than your death or Permanent Disability. 
    
  (d)    Prior to vesting, the Restricted Shares shall not be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or mortgaged, pledged or otherwise encumbered except as provided in this Agreement or in the Plan. 
    
  4.  Termination.    All of the Milestone Shares shall terminate and be forfeited to the Company immediately upon the failure of the Company to achieve the Milestones as set forth in Section 3(a)(i). All of the Time Shares shall terminate and be forfeited to the Company immediately upon the occurrence of a Termination Event at any time prior to the expiration of the Time Period, other than for your death or permanent disability, as set forth in Section 3(a)(ii). 
    
  5.  Rights as a Shareholder.    The Restricted Shares, when vested, will be represented by a stock certificate or certificates registered in your name upon your request. If requested by the Company, such certificate shall bear a legend in substantially the following form: 
  "The shares represented by this certificate are subject to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture and restrictions against transfer) contained in the LMI Aerospace, Inc. 2015 Long-Term incentive Plan. A copy of such Plan is on file in the office of LMI Aerospace, Inc." 
  You will deposit such certificates with the Company or its designee, together with stock powers or other instruments of assignment, each endorsed in blank, which will permit transfer to the Company of all or any portion of the Restricted Shares that shall have been forfeited. The Restricted Shares shall constitute issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock for all corporate purposes other than the right to receive and retain dividends or other distributions in respect of such shares ("Retained Distributions"). You will have the right to vote such Restricted Shares and to exercise all other rights, powers and privileges of a holder of Common Stock with respect to such shares, with the exception that (i) you will not be entitled to delivery of the stock certificate or certificates representing such Restricted Shares unless and until they are vested; (ii) the Company will retain custody of the stock certificate or certificates representing the Restricted Stock before vesting; (iii) the Company will retain custody of all distributions made or declared in respect of the Restricted Shares (and such Retained Distributions will be subject to the same restrictions, terms and conditions as are applicable to the Restricted Shares until such time, if ever, as the Restricted Shares with respect to which such Retained Distributions shall have been made, paid or declared shall have become vested, and such Retained Distributions shall not bear interest or be segregated in separate accounts); (iv) you may not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or mortgage, pledge, or otherwise encumber any Restricted Shares or any Retained Distributions unless and until the Restricted Shares vest; and (v) a breach of any restrictions, terms or conditions provided in the Plan or established by the Committee with respect to any Restricted Shares or Retained Distributions will cause a forfeiture of such Restricted Shares and any Retained Distributions with respect thereto. 

6.  Company Actions upon Vesting.    Upon the vesting of Restricted Shares in accordance with paragraph 3 above and the satisfaction of any other applicable restrictions, terms and conditions, all such Restricted Shares issued to you and any Retained Distributions with respect to such Restricted Shares shall be deemed vested and no longer subject to forfeiture. Upon your request, the Company shall promptly thereafter issue and deliver to you new stock certificates or instruments representing such Restricted Shares and other distributions registered in your name or, if deceased or disabled, your legatee, personal representative or distribute, which do not contain the legend set forth in Section 5 hereof. All such Retained Distributions, if any, less any amounts as are required to be withheld by law, shall be paid to you as of a date no later than two and   months after the year in which the Restricted Shares vest. 
    
  7.  Beneficiary Designation.    You may designate a beneficiary for each outstanding grant of Restricted Shares in the event of your death. If no beneficiary is designated or the beneficiary does not survive you, the award shall be made to your surviving spouse, or, if there is none, to your estate. 
    
  8.  Section 83(b) Election.    If you decide to file an election with the Internal Revenue Service to include the Fair Market Value of any of the Restricted Shares awarded hereunder in your gross income as of the date of this Award, you shall promptly furnish to the Company a copy of such election, together with the amount of any federal, state, local or other taxes required to be withheld, to enable the Company to claim an income tax deduction with respect to such election. 
    
  9.  Taxes.   Unless you have filed a Section 83(b) election as described in paragraph 8 above, the vesting of the Restricted Shares will trigger a taxable event. You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed in connection with the Award, regardless of any action the Company or any of its subsidiaries takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Award. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Award or the subsequent sale of Restricted Shares after the Restricted Shares have vested. The Company and its subsidiaries do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the Award to reduce or eliminate your tax liability. 
    
  10.  Registration.    The Company currently has an effective registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the Restricted Shares. The Company intends to maintain this registration but has no obligation to do so. If the registration ceases to be effective, you will not be able to transfer or sell the Restricted Shares even after the restrictions lapse unless exemptions from registration under applicable securities laws are available. Such exemptions from registration are limited and might be unavailable. You agree that any resale by you of Restricted Shares shall comply in all respects with the requirements of all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations (including, without limitation, the provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) and any other law, rule or regulation applicable thereto, as such laws, rules and regulations may be amended from time to time. The Company shall not be obligated to either issue the Restricted Shares or permit the resale of any shares following vesting, if such issuance or resale would violate any such requirements. 
    
  11.  Limitation on Rights; No Right to Future Grants.    By entering into this Agreement and accepting the Award, you acknowledge that: (a) the Plan is discretionary and may be modified, suspended or terminated by the  

Board at any time as provided in the Plan; (b) the grant of the Award is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of awards or benefits in lieu of awards; (c) all determinations with respect to any such future grants, including, but not limited to, the times when awards will be granted, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each award, the award price, if any, and the time or times when each award will be settled, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (d) your participation in the Plan is voluntary; (e) the Award is not part of normal or expected compensation for any purpose, including without limitation for calculating any benefits, severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-term service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments; (f) the future value of the common stock subject to the Award is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; and (g) neither the Plan, the Award nor the issuance of the Restricted Shares confers upon you any right to any relationship with the Company or any subsidiary other than as expressly provided hereby or thereby. 
    
  12.  Execution of Award Agreement.    Please acknowledge your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Award by signing the original of this Agreement and returning it to the Corporate Secretary of the Company at the principal corporate offices of the Company at 411 Fountain Lakes Blvd., St. Charles, Missouri 63301. If you do not sign and return this Agreement, the Company is not obligated to provide you any benefit hereunder and may refuse to issue the Restricted Shares to you. 
    
  13.  Governing Law.    The validity, construction, and effect of this Agreement and regulations relating to this Agreement, shall be determined in accordance with the internal laws, and not the law of conflicts, of the State of Missouri. 
    
  14.  Rights and Remedies Cumulative.    All rights and remedies of the Company and you enumerated in this Agreement shall be cumulative and, except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, none shall exclude any other rights or remedies allowed by law or in equity, and each of said rights or remedies may be exercised and enforced concurrently. 
    
  15.  Headings.    Headings are given to the sections and subsections of this Agreement solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction-or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision thereof. 
    
  16.  Entire Agreement.    This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire agreement between the Company and you in respect of the subject matter of this Agreement, and this Agreement supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements between the parties hereto in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement. No officer, employee or other servant or agent of the Company, and no servant or agent of you is authorized to make any representation, warranty or other promise not contained in this Agreement. No change, termination or attempted waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon any party hereto unless contained in a writing signed by the party to be charged. 
    
  17.  Successors and Assigns.    At the option of the Company, the rights of the Company under this Agreement may be transferable to any one or more persons or entities, and all covenants and agreements hereunder so transferred shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, such transferees. 

Very truly yours,
