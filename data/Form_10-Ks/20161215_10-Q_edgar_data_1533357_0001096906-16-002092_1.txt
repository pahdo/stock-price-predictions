1. Nature of Operations and Rescission of DTC Agreement

Defense Technologies International Corp. (the "Company ") was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 27, 1998.  Effective June 15, 2016, the Company changed its name to Defense Technologies International Corp. from Canyon Gold Corp. to more fully represent the Company's expansion goals into the advanced technology sector.

Effective July 15, 2016, the Company executed documents intended to finalize the acquisition of 100% of Defense Technology Corporation, a privately held Colorado company ("DTC"), a developer of defense, detection and protection products to improve security for Anchor schools and other public facilities.  DTC has informed us that it is unable to complete the required financial statements.  Accordingly, the Company will not be able to consolidate DTC's financial statements into its audited financial statements. After a thorough review of the situation and discussions with DTC, we have mutually agreed to rescind the acquisition of DTC and entered into a Rescission Agreement and Mutual Release (the "Rescission Agreement"), dated October 17, 2016.

In connection with the Rescission Agreement with the Company, DTC rescinded its agreement with the inventor and developer of the technology and assets that were subject to the original agreement between the Company and DTC.  On October 19, 2016, the Company entered into a new Definitive Agreement with Controlled Capture Systems, LLC ("CCS"), representing the inventor of the technology and assets previously acquired by DTC, that included a new exclusive Patent License Agreement and Independent Contractor agreement.  Under the license agreement with CCS, the Company acquired the world-wide exclusive rights and privileges to the CCS security technology, patents, products and improvements.  The Company agreed to pay CCS an initial licensing fee of $25,000 and to pay ongoing royalties as defined in the Definitive Agreement.  See Note 3. 

Going Concern

These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern.  Through October 31, 2016, the Company has no revenues, has accumulated losses of $4,285,598 and a working capital deficit of $2,226,322 and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which cast substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Management plans to continue to provide for the Company's capital needs during the year ending April 30, 2017 by issuing debt and equity securities and by the continued support of its related parties (see Note 4).  The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.  There is no assurance that funding will be available to continue the Company's business operations.

2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The Company's fiscal year end is April 30.

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared without audit in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Form 10-Q.  They do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  Therefore, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended April 30, 2016 included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the Company's consolidated financial position as of October 31, 2016, the consolidated results of its operations for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 and its consolidated cash flows for the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.  The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.

Consolidation

These condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Long Canyon Gold Resources Corp.  All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Net Income (Loss) per Common Share

Basic net income or loss per common share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income or loss per common share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income or loss by sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the dilutive potential common share equivalents then outstanding.  Potential dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method and the average market price per share during the period, and conversion of convertible debt, using the if converted method.  As of October 31, 2016, the Company had 10,577,860 potential shares issuable under outstanding options, warrants and convertible debt.

7 

The common shares used in the computation of our basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are reconciled as follows:

During the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, 9,277,860 and 2,365,098 shares issuable upon exercise of convertible debt, respectively, were excluded from the above calculation due to anti-dilution.  For the six months ended October 31, 2015, 2,365,098 shares issuable upon exercise of convertible debt were excluded from the above calculation due to anti-dilution.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 2015 condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

3. License Agreement

As discussed in Note 1, the Company rescinded its agreement to acquire DTC, and on October 19, 2016, the Company entered into a Definitive Agreement with CCS that included an exclusive Patent License Agreement ("License Agreement") and Independent Contractor Agreement.  Under the License Agreement, CCS granted to the Company an exclusive world-wide license to the assets comprising the technology and products of the defense, detection and protection security products invented and developed by the inventor and CCS.  The term of the License Agreement shall be from October 19, 2016 until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed issued patents or patents to be issued.

The Company agreed to pay CCS an initial licensing fee of $25,000 and to pay ongoing royalties at the end of each six-month period at the rate of the greater of 5% of gross sales used or sold, or the minimum royalty payment of $25,000.  The Company also agreed to compensate investors that have provided funding for the development of CCS's technology with 4,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock.  Additionally, CCS will be entitled to receive 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock upon completed sales of 1,000 passive scanner units based on the CCS technology.

The Independent Contractor Agreement between the Company and CCS provides that CCS will provide support for the development of the security technology and products.  An initial payment of $5,000 is to be paid to CCS plus ongoing hourly compensation for services provided.

The Company has capitalized the costs to acquire the License Agreement, including the $25,000 initial licensing fee and the estimated value of the 4,000,000 shares of common stock to be issued to the CCS investors of $353,600, which is based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of the Definitive Agreement.  The Company has recorded a current liability of $378,600 for these obligations in its consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2016.  Once sales of products based on the CCS technology begin, the Company will amortize the capitalized costs over the estimated life of the license agreement as determined by the legal life of patents issued.

4. Related Party Transactions and Balances

Management and administrative services are currently compensated as per a Service Agreement between the Company and its Chief Executive Officer and Director executed on April 25, 2016, a Service Agreement between the Company and a Director executed on May 20, 2016, and an Administration Agreement with a related party executed on March 15, 2011 and renewed on May 1, 2015, whereby the fee is based on services provided and invoiced by the related parties on a monthly basis and the fees are paid in cash when possible or with common stock.  The Company also, from time to time, has some of its expenses paid by related parties with the intent to repay.  These types of transactions, when incurred, result in payables to related parties in the Company's consolidated financial statements as a necessary part of funding the Company's operations.

As of October 31, 2016, and April 30, 2016, the Company had payable balances due to related parties totaling $631,654 and $565,459, respectively, which resulted from transactions with these related parties and other significant shareholders.

6. Financial Instruments

The convertible notes payable and related derivative liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and estimated as follows at October 31, 2016:

7. Stockholders' Deficit 

During the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company issued a total of 5,326,380 shares of its common stock: 2,630,000 shares for services valued at $570,110; 16,500 shares in payment of accrued fees payable of $10,325, recognizing a gain on extinguishment of debt of $4,550; 1,829,880 shares in the conversion of debt principal of $72,605 and accrued interest payable of $11,644; 550,000 shares valued at $80,000 for debt issuance costs; and 300,000 shares valued at $38,400 for settlement of warrants (see Note 8).

All issuances of the Company's common stock for non-cash consideration have been assigned a dollar amount equaling either the market value of the shares issued or the value of consideration received whichever is more readily determinable.  Most the non-cash consideration received pertaining to services rendered by consultants and others has been valued at the market value of the shares issued. 

8.  Stock Options and Warrants

During the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company issued warrants to a lender to purchase 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $0.60 per share.

During the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company issued warrants to a consultant to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share. The warrants vested upon grant and expire on June 14, 2017.  The Company estimated the grant date fair value of the warrants at $9,056 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and charged the amount to general and administrative expenses.

The following assumptions were used in estimating the value of the warrants:

A summary of the Company's stock options and warrants as of October 31, 2016, and changes during the six months then ended is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on our closing stock price of $0.11 as of October 31, 2016, which would have been received by the holders of in-the-money options had the option holders exercised their options as of that date.

The total obligation of $88,400 has been recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.   

9. Contingencies and Commitments

The Company has the following material commitments as of October 31, 2016:

a)  

Administration Agreement with EMAC Handels AG, renewed effective May 1, 2015 for a period of three years. Monthly fee for administration services of $5,000, office rent of $250 and office supplies of $125.  Extraordinary expenses are invoiced by EMAC on a quarterly basis.  The fee may be paid in cash and or with common stock.

b)  

Service Agreement signed April 25, 2016 with Merrill W. Moses, President, Director and CEO, for services of $7,500 per month beginning May 2016 and the issuance of a total 700,000 restricted common shares of the Company.  The fees may be paid in cash and or with common stock.

10. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-17, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held Through Related Parties That are Under Common Control." This update amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity ("VIE") should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the reporting entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE and, therefore, consolidates the VIE. A reporting entity has an indirect interest in a VIE if it has a direct interest in a related party that, in turn, has a direct interest in the VIE. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company is currently unable to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently unable to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement.

Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB, which the Company has adopted or will adopt, as applicable, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Item 2.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview

The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.

Defense Technologies International Corp. (the "Company ") was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 27, 1998.  Effective June 15, 2016, the Company changed its name to Defense Technologies International Corp. from Canyon Gold Corp. to more fully represent the Company's expansion goals into the advanced technology sector.

Effective July 15, 2016, the Company executed documents intended to finalize the acquisition of 100% of Defense Technology Corporation, a privately held Colorado company ("DTC"), a developer of defense, detection and protection products to improve security for Anchor schools and other public facilities.  DTC has informed us that it is unable to complete the required financial statements.  Accordingly, the Company will not be able to consolidate DTC's financial statements into its audited financial statements. After a thorough review of the situation and discussions with DTC, we have mutually agreed to rescind the acquisition of DTC and entered into a Rescission Agreement and Mutual Release (the "Rescission Agreement"), effective October 17, 2016.

In connection with the Rescission Agreement with the Company, DTC rescinded its agreement with the inventor and developer of the technology and assets that were subject to the original agreement between the Company and DTC.  On October 19, 2016, the Company entered into a new Definitive Agreement with Controlled Capture Systems, LLC ("CCS"), representing the inventor of the technology and assets previously acquired by DTC, that included a new exclusive Patent License Agreement and Independent Contractor agreement.  Under the license agreement with CCS, the Company acquired the world-wide exclusive rights and privileges to the CCS security technology, patents, products and improvements.  The Company agreed to pay CCS an initial licensing fee of $25,000 and to pay ongoing royalties as defined in the Definitive Agreement.

The security products licensed from CCS and to be developed by the Company are designed for personal and collateral protection.  The proposed detection technology is intended to provide passive security scanning units for either walk-through or hand-held use.  The units use electromagnets and do not emit anything (such as x-rays) through the subject.  The Company recently completed a prototype and currently has an operational testing unit.  The units are intended to improve security for schools and other public facilities.

Our principal executive office is located at 4730 South Fort Apache Road, Suite 300, Las Vegas, Nevada 89147, telephone 1-(800) 520-9485.  Additional office space is subleased from EMAC at 641 West 3rd Street, North Vancouver BC, Canada.  The office of DRLLC that is responsible for management of exploration program is located at 125 East Main Street # 307, American Fork, Utah 84003.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements

This report contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "intend," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue," or similar terms, variations of such terms or the negative of such terms.  These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors.  Although forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment, actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.  Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.

19 

Going Concern

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern.  Through October 31, 2016, the Company has no revenues, has accumulated losses of $4,285,598 and a working capital deficit of $2,226,322 and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which cast substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Management plans to continue to provide for the Company's capital needs during the year ending April 30, 2017 by issuing debt and equity securities and by the continued support of its related parties.  The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.  There is no assurance that funding will be available to continue the Company's business operations.

Results of Operations

We currently have no sources of operating revenues. Accordingly, no revenues were recorded for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.

Our general and administrative expenses increased $244,318 to $290,008 in the three months ended October 31, 2016 from $45,690 in the three months ended October 31, 2015, and increased $851,185 to $968,346 in the six months ended October 31, 2016 from $117,161 in the six months ended October 31, 2015.  The increases are due primarily to an increase in stock based compensation, including shares issued to our new President and to a Director, and the issuance of shares to investor relations consultants.  We also incurred an increase in professional fees and costs associated with the rescinded agreement with DTC and the new Definitive Agreement with CCS.

Exploration costs were $1,452 in the three months ended October 31, 2016 compared to $1,725 in the three months ended October 31, 2015, and were $1,452 in the six months ended October 31, 2016 compared to $3,375 in the six months ended October 31, 2015.  The exploration costs for all periods consisted of State of Nevada annual claims maintenance fees and the costs of re-staking the Nevada mineral claims.

Our interest expense increased to $133,466 in the three months ended October 31, 2016 from $62,006 in the three months ended October 31, 2015, and increased to $438,361 in the six months ended October 31, 2016 from $90,420 in the six months ended October 31, 2015.  The increase in interest expense is due primarily to new interest-bearing debt issued to institutional investors, related extension and early payment penalties, and to the amortization of debt discount to interest expense in the current year.  A portion of our interest expense is incurred to related parties.

We recognized a loss on derivative liability of $174,907 and $70,567 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We recognized a gain on derivative liability of $1,323,152 in the six months ended October 31, 2016 and a loss on derivative liability of $144,941 in the six months ended October 31, 2015.  We estimate the fair value of the derivative for the conversion feature of our convertible notes payable using the Black-Scholes pricing model at the inception of the debt, at the date of conversions to equity, cash payments and at each reporting date, recording a derivative liability, debt discount and a gain or loss on change in derivative liability as applicable.  These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility, and variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective loan agreements.  These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability will fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuation may be material.

We recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $189,786 and $92,712 in the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and of $311,189 and $155,459 in the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The gain on extinguishment of debt resulted primarily from the elimination of derivative liabilities upon debt extinguishment.

As a result, we recognized a net loss of $410,047 and $87,276 in the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and a net loss of $200,438 in the six months ended October 31, 2015.  Primarily due to the gain on derivative liability, we reported net income of $226,182 in the six months ended October 31, 2016.

20 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At October 31, 2016, we had total current assets of $4,042, including cash of $42 and prepaid expenses of $4,000, and total current liabilities of $2,230,364, resulting in a working capital deficit of $2,226,322.  Included in our current liabilities and working capital deficit are derivative liabilities totaling $303,635 related to the conversion features of certain of our convertible notes payable.  We do not believe the derivative liabilities will be required to be settled in cash.

A significant portion of our current liabilities as of October 31, 2016 is comprised of amounts due to related parties: accrued interest payable   related parties of $21,197; convertible notes payable   related parties of $57,050; notes payable   related parties of $79,656; and payables   related parties of $631,654.  We anticipate that in the short-term, operating funds will continue to be provided by related parties and other lenders.

At October 31, 2016, we had total convertible notes payable of $449,915, net of discount of $156,325.  Several of the note agreements require repayment through conversion of principal and interest into shares of the Company's common stock.  We anticipate, therefore, converting these notes payable into shares of our common stock without the need for replacement financing; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing this.

Pursuant to nine convertible notes payable, we received total cash proceeds of $423,590 during the six months ended October 31, 2016.  These short-term notes, which have a total principal balance of $443,590 at October 31, 2016 (including $20,000 total original interest discount), bear interest at annual rates ranging from 6% to 12% per annum and are convertible into common shares of the Company upon the terms and subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in the note agreements.  The notes generally contain early repayment penalties if repaid before defined payment dates in the note agreements.

From proceeds from the new convertible notes payable, we repaid $117,894 in principal of convertible notes payable and further extinguished $72,605 in principal through conversion of convertible notes payable to common stock.

During the six months ended October 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $294,177, as a result of our net income of $226,182, non-cash expenses totaling $994,587 and increases in accounts payable of $67,284, accrued interest payable   related parties of $3,351 and payables   related parties of $66,195, offset by non-cash gains totaling $1,634,341, increase in prepaid expenses of $2,125, and a decrease in accrued interest and fees payable of $15,310.

During the six months ended October 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $43,803, as a result of our net loss of $200,438, gain on extinguishment of debt of $155,459, increase in prepaid expenses of $5,642 and decrease in accrued interest and fees payable of $1,169, offset by non-cash expenses totaling $162,651 and increases in accounts payable of $49,130, accrued interest payable   related parties of $3,351, and payables   related parties of $191,379.

During the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no cash provided by or used in investing activities.

During the six months ended October 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $294,177, comprised of proceeds from convertible notes payable of $423,590   , partially offset by repayment of convertible notes payable of $117,894 and payment of debt issuance costs of $11,500.

During the six months ended October 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $43,986, comprised of repayment of convertible notes payable.

We have not realized any revenues since inception and paid expenses and costs with proceeds from the issuance of securities as well as by loans from investor, stockholders and other related parties.

Our immediate goal is to provide funding for the completion of the initial production of the Offender Alert Passive Scan licensed from CCS.  The Offender Alert Passive Scan is an advanced passive scanning system for detecting and identifying concealed threats.

We believe a related party and other lenders will provide sufficient funds to carry on general operations in the near term and fund DTC's production and sales.  We expect to raise additional funds from the sale of securities, stockholder loans and convertible debt.  However, we may not be successful in our efforts to obtain financing to carry out our business plan.

As of October 31, 2016, we did not have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the next twelve months.

21 

Inflation

In the opinion of management, inflation has not and will not have a material effect on our operations until such time as we successfully complete an acquisition or merger.  At that time, management will evaluate the possible effects of inflation related to our business and operations following a successful acquisition or merger.

Critical Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Net Income (Loss) per Common Share

Basic net income or loss per common share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income or loss per common share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income or loss by sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the dilutive potential common share equivalents then outstanding.  Potential dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method and the average market price per share during the period, and conversion of convertible debt, using the if converted method.   

Exploration Costs

All sampling, metallurgical, engineering, contractor costs, and efforts to obtain mineral rights have been charged to expense as incurred.

Non-Monetary Transactions

All issuances of our common stock for non-cash consideration have been assigned a dollar amount equaling either the market value of the shares issued or the value of consideration received whichever is more readily determinable.  The majority of the non-cash consideration received pertains to services rendered by consultants and others and has been valued at the market value of the shares issued.

Our accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of ASC 505,   Equity Based Payments to Non Employees  , where the equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.  The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete. 

In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement.

Comprehensive Loss

We have no component of other comprehensive income.  Accordingly, net loss equals comprehensive loss for the three months and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.

Income Taxes

We provide for income taxes under ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse.  Our predecessor operated as entity exempt from federal and state income taxes.

ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

22 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows.  If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from the sale of products will be recorded when the product is shipped, title and risk of loss have transferred to the purchaser, payment terms are fixed or determinable and payment is reasonably assured.  Revenues from service contracts will be recognized when performance of the service is complete or over the term of the contract.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have either implemented or that may have a material future impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders . 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

This item is not required for a smaller reporting company.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  .  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) ("Exchange Act").  Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

We operate with a limited number of accounting and financial personnel.  Although we retain the services of an experienced certified public accountant, we have been unable to implement proper segregation of duties over certain accounting and financial reporting processes, including timely and proper documentation of material transactions and agreements.  We believe these control deficiencies represent material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.

Despite the material weaknesses in financial reporting noted above, we believe that our consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in all material respects.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting .  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
