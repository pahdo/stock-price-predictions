NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Mayetok,  Inc. ("the Company") was  incorporated in the state of Nevada on April

Corp.

NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY
On June 10, 2014,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued
update ASU  2014-10,  Development  Stage  Entities  (Topic 915).  Amongst  other
things,  the  amendments in this update  removed the  definition of  development
stage  entity  from  Topic  915,  thereby   removing  the  distinction   between
development  stage  entities  and  other  reporting  entities  from US GAAP.  In
addition,  the  amendments  eliminate the  requirements  for  development  stage
entities to (1)  present  inception-to-date  information  on the  statements  of
income, cash flows and shareholders  equity, (2) label the financial  statements
as those of a  development  stage  entity;  (3)  disclose a  description  of the
development  stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose in
the first year in which the entity is no longer a development  stage entity that
in  prior  years  it had  been in the  development  stage.  The  amendments  are
effective for annual  reporting  periods  beginning  after December 31, 2014 and
interim reporting  periods  beginning after December 15, 2015,  however entities
are  permitted  to early  adopt for any annual or interim  reporting  period for
which the financial statements have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to
early adopt these  amendments  and  accordingly  have not labeled the  financial
statements  as those  of a  development  stage  entity  and  have not  presented
inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The financial  statements  of the Company have been prepared in accordance  with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are
presented in US dollars.

The unaudited interim condensed  financial  statements included herein have been
prepared by First  American  Silver Corp.  (the  "Company") in  accordance  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the
rules of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (the "SEC").  We suggest that
these  interim  financial  statements  be read in  conjunction  with the audited
financial  statements  and notes thereto  included in our Form 10-K for the year
ended November 30, 2015, as filed with the SEC. We believe that all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of
financial  position  and the  results  of  operations  for the  interim  periods
presented have been reflected  herein and that the disclosures made are adequate
to make the information  not  misleading.  The results of operations for interim
periods are not  necessarily  indicative  of the results to be expected  for the
full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate
the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent
fiscal year as reported in Form 10-K have been omitted

ACCOUNTING BASIS
The Company  uses the accrual  basis of  accounting  and  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the United  States of America  ("GAAP"  accounting).  The
Company has adopted a November 30 fiscal year end.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The  Company's  operations  are subject to  significant  risk and  uncertainties
including financial, operational,  technological, and regulatory risks including
the  potential  risk of business  failure.  See Note 10 regarding  going concern
matters.

                     NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                           AUGUST 31, 2016 (Unaudited)

NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company  considers all highly liquid  investments  with  maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. At August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015,
respectively,  the  Company  had $0 and $0 of  unrestricted  cash to be used for
future business operations.

The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are
insured up to $250,000.  At times,  the  Company's  bank deposits may exceed the
insured  amount.  Management  believes it has little risk  related to the excess
deposits.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company's financial instruments consist of cash, prepaid expenses,  accounts
payable,  accrued expenses,  notes payable, and note payable-related  party. The
carrying amount of these financial  instruments  approximates  fair value due to
either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate  prevailing  market
rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit  accounts,  the balances of which
at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company  continually  monitors
its banking  relationships  and  consequently  has not experienced any losses in
such accounts.  The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit
risk on cash and cash equivalents.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company  accounts for employee  stock-based  compensation in accordance with
the guidance of ASC Topic 718,  COMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION which requires
all  share-based  payments to  employees,  including  grants of  employee  stock
options,  to be  recognized  in the  financial  statements  based on their  fair
values. There has been no stock-based compensation issued to employees.

The Company  follows ASC Topic  505-50,  formerly  EITF 96-18,  "ACCOUNTING  FOR
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE ISSUED TO OTHER THAN EMPLOYEES FOR ACQUIRING,  OR IN
CONJUNCTION  WITH SELLING  GOODS AND  SERVICES,"  for stock options and warrants
issued to  consultants  and other  non-employees.  In accordance  with ASC Topic
505-50,  these stock options and warrants  issued as  compensation  for services
provided  to the  Company  are  accounted  for based  upon the fair value of the
services  provided or the estimated  fair market value of the option or warrant,
whichever  can be  more  clearly  determined.  The  fair  value  of  the  equity
instrument is charged  directly to compensation  expense and additional  paid-in
capital over the period during which services are rendered.

INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.  Under the asset
and liability method,  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
A valuation  allowance  is provided  for the amount of deferred tax assets that,
based  on  available  evidence,  are  not  expected  to be  realized.  It is the
Company's policy to classify  interest and penalties on income taxes as interest
expense or penalties expense. As of August 31, 2016, there have been no interest
or penalties incurred on income taxes.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and liabilities at the date the financial  statements and the
reported  amount of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company is in the  exploration  stage and has yet to realize  revenues  from
operations.  Once  the  Company  has  commenced  operations,  it will  recognize
revenues when delivery of goods or completion of services has occurred  provided
there is persuasive  evidence of an agreement,  acceptance  has been approved by
its  customers,  the fee is fixed or  determinable  based on the  completion  of
stated  terms and  conditions,  and  collection  of any  related  receivable  is
probable.

BASIC INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic income  (loss) per share is  calculated by dividing the Company's net loss
applicable  to common  shareholders  by the  weighted  average  number of common
shares during the period.  Diluted  earnings per share is calculated by dividing
the  Company's  net  income  available  to common  shareholders  by the  diluted
weighted  average  number of shares  outstanding  during the year.  The  diluted
weighted  average number of shares  outstanding is the basic weighted  number of
shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity.

NOTE 3 - PREPAID EXPENSES

Prepaid expenses consisted of the following:

                                              August 31,         November 30,

NOTE 6 - GOING CONCERN

The  accompanying  financial  statements have been prepared  assuming that First
American  Silver,  Inc.  will  continue  as a going  concern.  The Company has a
working capital deficit,  has not yet received revenue from sales of products or
services,  and  has  incurred  losses  from  operations.   These  factors  raise
substantial  doubt about the Company's  ability to continue as a going  concern.
Without  realization of additional debt or capital, it would be unlikely for the
Company to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.

inception  to date  loss of  approximately  $1,738,000  as of August  31,  2016.
Management  continues to seek funding from its  shareholders and other qualified
investors.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

                           FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

This quarterly  report contains  forward-looking  statements.  These  statements
relate to future events or our future financial performance.  In some cases, you
can identify forward-looking  statements by terminology such as "may", "should",
"expects",  "plans",   "anticipates",   "believes",   "estimates",   "predicts",
"potential"  or  "continue"  or the negative of these terms or other  comparable
terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown
risks,  uncertainties  and other  factors  that may cause our or our  industry's
actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially
different  from  any  future  results,   levels  of  activity,   performance  or
achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity,  performance
or achievements.  Except as required by applicable law, including the securities
laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking
statements to conform these statements to actual results.

Our unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and
are prepared in accordance  with United  States  Generally  Accepted  Accounting
Principles.  The following  discussion  should be read in  conjunction  with our
financial  statements  and the  related  notes  that  appear  elsewhere  in this
quarterly report. The following discussion contains  forward-looking  statements
that reflect our plans,  estimates and beliefs.  Our actual results could differ
materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.  Factors that
could cause or contribute to such differences  include,  but are not limited to,
those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report.

Our  financial  statements  are stated in United  States  Dollars  (US$) and are
prepared  in  accordance  with  United  States  Generally  Accepted   Accounting
Principles.

In this quarterly  report,  unless otherwise  specified,  all dollar amounts are
expressed in United States dollars and all  references to "common  shares" refer
to the common shares in our capital stock.

As used in this quarterly report,  the terms "we", "us", "our" and "our company"
mean First American Silver Corp., unless otherwise indicated.

GENERAL OVERVIEW

We were  incorporated  in the State of Nevada on April 29, 2008,  under the name
"Mayetok,  Inc.".  As Mayetok,  Inc.  we were  engaged in the  development  of a
website to market vacation properties in the Ukraine.

On June 8, 2010,  we  initiated a one (1) old for 35 new forward  stock split of
our issued and  outstanding  common stock. As a result,  our authorized  capital
increased  from  100,000,000  to  3,500,000,000  shares of common  stock and the
issued  and  outstanding  increased  from  2,200,000  shares of common  stock to
77,000,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001.

Also on June 8,  2010,  we  changed  our name  from  "Mayetok,  Inc." to  "First
American  Silver  Corp.",  by way of a merger with our wholly  owned  subsidiary
First American Silver Corp.,  which was formed solely for the change of name. We
changed the name of our company to reflect the new  direction  of our company in
the business of acquiring,  exploring and developing mineral  properties.  As of
June  2010,  we had  abandoned  our  former  business  plan of seeking to market
vacation properties.

Our  name  change  and   forward   stock  split   became   effective   with  the
Over-the-Counter  Bulletin  Board at the opening of trading on June 16, 2010, on
which date we adopted the new stock symbol "FASV".

OUR CURRENT BUSINESS

In 2014, we abandoned  our mineral  property  business and initiated  efforts to
enter a new line of  business.  To-date,  although  our company has engaged in a
number  of  negotiations  in  respect  of new  business  lines,  we have not yet
consummated any transactions or started any new commercial activities.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31,
2015

We had a net loss of $8,984 for the three month  period  ended  August 31, 2016,
which was $25,042  less than the net loss of $34,026 for the three month  period
ended  August 31,  2015.  The change in our  results  over the two  periods is a
result of decreased  consulting fees and interest  expense offset by an increase
in accounting and legal fees.

increase (decrease) for the three month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August

NINE     MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 31, 2016  COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST
         31, 2015

We had a net loss of $49,871 for the nine month  period  ended  August 31, 2016,
which was $67,908  less than the net loss of $117,779  for the nine month period
ended August,  2015.  The change in our results over the two periods is a result
of  decreased  consulting  fees and  interest  expense  offset by an increase in
accounting and legal fees.

REVENUE

We have not earned any revenues  since our  inception  and we do not  anticipate
earning revenues in the upcoming quarter.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our balance sheet as of August 31, 2016 reflects  current  assets of $1,981.  We
had cash in the amount of $1,981 and a working  capital deficit in the amount of
$481,768 as of August 31, 2016. We have sufficient  working capital to enable us
to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

Net cash used in  operating  activities  during the nine months ended August 31,
2016 was $27,019, an increase of $2,047 from the $24,972 net cash outflow during
the nine months ended August 31, 2015.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

Cash from financing  activities during the nine months ended August 31, 2016 was
$29,000 as compared to $24,972 in cash provided by financing  activities  during
the nine months ended August 31, 2015.

We estimate that our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the
next 12 months to be as follows:

            ESTIMATED NET EXPENDITURES DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS

              General and administrative expenses          $14,000
              Professional fees                             10,000

To date we have  relied  on  proceeds  from the sale of our  shares  in order to
sustain our basic, minimum operating expenses; however, we cannot guarantee that
we will secure any further  sales of our  shares.  We estimate  that the cost of
maintaining  basic corporate  operations  (which includes the cost of satisfying
our public reporting obligations) will be approximately $2,000 per month. Due to
our current cash  position of  approximately  $1,981 as of August 31,  2016,  we
estimate that we have  sufficient  cash to sustain our basic  operations for the
next twelve months.

We  are  not  aware  of  any  known  trends,  demands,  commitments,  events  or
uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our
liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.

FUTURE FINANCINGS

We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to
continue to fund our business  operations.  Issuances of additional  shares will
result in dilution to our existing  stockholders.  There is no assurance that we
will achieve any additional  sales of our equity  securities or arrange for debt
or other financing to fund our planned business activities.

                                       15
 
We presently  do not have any  arrangements  for  additional  financing  for the
expansion of our  exploration  operations,  and no potential  lines of credit or
sources of financing are currently  available for the purpose of proceeding with
our plan of operations.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We have no off-balance sheet  arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition,  revenues or expenses, results of operations,  liquidity, and capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY
On June 10, 2014,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued
update ASU  2014-10,  Development  Stage  Entities  (Topic 915).  Amongst  other
things,  the  amendments in this update  removed the  definition of  development
stage  entity  from  Topic  915,  thereby   removing  the  distinction   between
development  stage  entities  and  other  reporting  entities  from US GAAP.  In
addition,  the  amendments  eliminate the  requirements  for  development  stage
entities to (1)  present  inception-to-date  information  on the  statements  of
income, cash flows and shareholders  equity, (2) label the financial  statements
as those of a  development  stage  entity;  (3)  disclose a  description  of the
development  stage activities in which the entity is engaged and (4) disclose in
the first year in which the entity is no longer a development  stage entity that
in  prior  years  it had  been in the  development  stage.  The  amendments  are
effective for annual  reporting  periods  beginning  after December 31, 2014 and
interim reporting  periods  beginning after December 15, 2015,  however entities
are  permitted  to early  adopt for any annual or interim  reporting  period for
which the financial statements have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to
early adopt these  amendments  and  accordingly  have not labeled the  financial
statements  as those  of a  development  stage  entity  and  have not  presented
inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The financial  statements  of the Company have been prepared in accordance  with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are
presented in US dollars.

The unaudited interim condensed  financial  statements included herein have been
prepared by First  American  Silver Corp.  (the  "Company") in  accordance  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the
rules of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (the "SEC").  We suggest that
these  interim  financial  statements  be read in  conjunction  with the audited
financial  statements  and notes thereto  included in our Form 10-K for the year
ended November 30, 2015, as filed with the SEC. We believe that all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of
financial  position  and the  results  of  operations  for the  interim  periods
presented have been reflected  herein and that the disclosures made are adequate
to make the information  not  misleading.  The results of operations for interim
periods are not  necessarily  indicative  of the results to be expected  for the
full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate
the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent
fiscal year as reported in Form 10-K have been omitted

ACCOUNTING BASIS
The Company  uses the accrual  basis of  accounting  and  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the United  States of America  ("GAAP"  accounting).  The
Company has adopted a November 30 fiscal year end.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The  Company's  operations  are subject to  significant  risk and  uncertainties
including financial, operational,  technological, and regulatory risks including
the  potential  risk of business  failure.  See Note 10 regarding  going concern
matters.

                                       16
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company  considers all highly liquid  investments  with  maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. At August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015,
respectively,  the  Company  had $0 and $0 of  unrestricted  cash to be used for
future business operations.

The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are
insured up to $250,000.  At times,  the  Company's  bank deposits may exceed the
insured  amount.  Management  believes it has little risk  related to the excess
deposits.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company's financial instruments consist of cash, prepaid expenses,  accounts
payable,  accrued expenses,  notes payable, and note payable-related  party. The
carrying amount of these financial  instruments  approximates  fair value due to
either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate  prevailing  market
rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit  accounts,  the balances of which
at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company  continually  monitors
its banking  relationships  and  consequently  has not experienced any losses in
such accounts.  The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit
risk on cash and cash equivalents.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company  accounts for employee  stock-based  compensation in accordance with
the guidance of ASC Topic 718,  COMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION which requires
all  share-based  payments to  employees,  including  grants of  employee  stock
options,  to be  recognized  in the  financial  statements  based on their  fair
values. There has been no stock-based compensation issued to employees.

The Company  follows ASC Topic  505-50,  formerly  EITF 96-18,  "ACCOUNTING  FOR
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE ISSUED TO OTHER THAN EMPLOYEES FOR ACQUIRING,  OR IN
CONJUNCTION  WITH SELLING  GOODS AND  SERVICES,"  for stock options and warrants
issued to  consultants  and other  non-employees.  In accordance  with ASC Topic
505-50,  these stock options and warrants  issued as  compensation  for services
provided  to the  Company  are  accounted  for based  upon the fair value of the
services  provided or the estimated  fair market value of the option or warrant,
whichever  can be  more  clearly  determined.  The  fair  value  of  the  equity
instrument is charged  directly to compensation  expense and additional  paid-in
capital over the period during which services are rendered.

INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.  Under the asset
and liability method,  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
A valuation  allowance  is provided  for the amount of deferred tax assets that,
based  on  available  evidence,  are  not  expected  to be  realized.  It is the
Company's policy to classify  interest and penalties on income taxes as interest
expense or penalties expense. As of August 31, 2016, there have been no interest
or penalties incurred on income taxes.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and liabilities at the date the financial  statements and the
reported  amount of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company is in the  exploration  stage and has yet to realize  revenues  from
operations.  Once  the  Company  has  commenced  operations,  it will  recognize
revenues when delivery of goods or completion of services has occurred  provided
there is persuasive  evidence of an agreement,  acceptance  has been approved by
its  customers,  the fee is fixed or  determinable  based on the  completion  of
stated  terms and  conditions,  and  collection  of any  related  receivable  is
probable.

BASIC INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic income  (loss) per share is  calculated by dividing the Company's net loss
applicable  to common  shareholders  by the  weighted  average  number of common
shares during the period.  Diluted  earnings per share is calculated by dividing
the  Company's  net  income  available  to common  shareholders  by the  diluted
weighted  average  number of shares  outstanding  during the year.  The  diluted
weighted  average number of shares  outstanding is the basic weighted  number of
shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity.

I, Brian Goss, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of First American Silver
     Corp.;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of
     the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over
     financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and
     15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

     (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;
     (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
          reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;
     (c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end
          of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and
     (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in
          the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
          reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
     the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board
     of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
