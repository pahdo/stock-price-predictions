 Basis of Presentation

Within the accompanying unaudited consolidated statement of financial condition, and related notes to the consolidated financial statements, June 30, 2016 data was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Greene County Bancorp, Inc. (the  Company ) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, The Bank of Greene County (the  Bank ) and Greene Risk Management, Inc., and the Bank s wholly owned subsidiaries, Greene County Commercial Bank and Greene Property Holdings, Ltd.  The consolidated financial statements at and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  To the extent that information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements are contained in or are consistent with the audited financial statements incorporated by reference to Greene County Bancorp, Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, such information and notes have not been duplicated herein.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring items) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented have been included.   Amounts in the prior year s consolidated financial statements have been reclassified whenever necessary to conform to the current year s presentation.  These reclassifications, if any, had no effect on net income or retained earnings as previously reported.  All material inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation. The results of operations and other data for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.   These consolidated financial statements consider events that occurred through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Greene County Bancorp, Inc. s critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses and the evaluation of securities for other-than-temporary impairment.  The allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimation of an amount that is intended to absorb losses in the existing portfolio.  The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, the composition of the portfolio, specific impaired loans and current economic conditions.  Such evaluation, which includes a review of all loans for which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters, the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience, management s estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for the allowance of loan losses.  However, this evaluation involves a high degree of complexity and requires management to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters.  This critical accounting policy and its application are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.

Securities are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment by performing periodic reviews of individual securities in the investment portfolio.  Greene County Bancorp, Inc. makes an assessment to determine whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security, on which there is an unrealized loss, is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis.  The Company considers many factors, including the severity and duration of the impairment; the intent and ability of the Company to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value; recent events specific to the issuer or industry; and for debt securities, the intent to sell the security, the likelihood to be required to sell the security before it recovers the entire amortized cost, external credit ratings and recent downgrades.  The Company is required to record other-than-temporary impairment charges through earnings, if it has the intent to sell, or will more likely than not be required to sell an impaired debt security before a recovery of its amortized cost basis.  In addition, the Company is required to record other-than-temporary impairment charges through earnings for the amount of credit losses, regardless of the intent or requirement to sell.  Credit loss is measured as the difference between the present value of an impaired debt security s cash flows and its amortized cost basis.  Non-credit related write-downs to fair value must be recorded as decreases to accumulated other comprehensive income as long as the Company has no intent or requirement to sell an impaired security before a recovery of amortized cost basis.

 Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.  Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the assessment of other-than-temporary security impairment.

While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses (the  Allowance ) may be necessary, based on changes in economic conditions, asset quality or other factors.  In addition, various regulatory authorities, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Allowance.  Such authorities may require the Company to recognize additions to the Allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.

Greene County Bancorp, Inc. makes an assessment to determine whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other-than-temporary basis.  The Company considers many factors including the severity and duration of the impairment; the intent and ability of the Company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value; recent events specific to the issuer or industry; and for debt securities, intent to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery, whether loss is expected, external credit ratings and recent downgrades.  Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value through earnings.

Securities at June 30, 2016 consisted of the following:

Greene County Bancorp, Inc. s current policies generally limit securities investments to U.S. Government and securities of government sponsored enterprises, federal funds sold, municipal bonds, corporate debt obligations and certain mutual funds.  In addition, the Company s policies permit investments in mortgage-backed securities, including securities issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and GNMA, and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by these entities.  As of September 30, 2016, all mortgage-backed securities including collateralized mortgage obligations were securities of government sponsored enterprises, no private-label mortgage-backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations were held in the securities portfolio.   The Company s investments in state and political subdivisions securities generally are municipal obligations that are general obligations supported by the general taxing authority of the issuer, and in some cases are insured.  The obligations issued by school districts are supported by state aid.  Primarily, these investments are issued by municipalities within New York State. 

The following table shows fair value and gross unrealized losses, aggregated by security category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at September 30, 2016.

The following table shows fair value and gross unrealized losses, aggregated by security category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at June 30, 2016.

When the fair value of a held-to-maturity or available-for-sale security is less than its amortized cost basis, an assessment is made as to whether other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) is present.  The Company considers numerous factors when determining whether a potential OTTI exists and the period over which the debt security is expected to recover.  The principal factors considered are (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, (2) the financial condition of the issuer (and guarantor, if any) and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, industry or geographic area, (3) failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments, (4) any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and (5) the presence of credit enhancements, if any, including the guarantee of the federal government or any of its agencies.

For debt securities, OTTI is considered to have occurred if (1) the Company intends to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) if the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis.  In determining the present value of expected cash flows, the Company discounts the expected cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition.  In estimating cash flows expected to be collected, the Company uses available information with respect to security prepayment speeds, default rates and severity.  In determining whether OTTI has occurred for equity securities, the Company considers the applicable factors described above and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.

For debt securities, credit-related OTTI is recognized in income while noncredit related OTTI on securities not expected to be sold is recognized in other comprehensive income ( OCI ).  Credit-related OTTI is measured as the difference between the present value of an impaired security s expected cash flows and its amortized cost basis.  Noncredit-related OTTI is measured as the difference between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost less any credit-related losses recognized.  For securities classified as held-to-maturity, the amount of OTTI recognized in OCI is accreted to the credit-adjusted expected cash flow amounts of the securities over future periods.  For equity securities, the entire amount of OTTI is recognized in income.  Management evaluated securities considering the factors as outlined above, and based on this evaluation the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.  Management believes that the reasons for the decline in fair value are due to interest rates and widening credit spreads at the end of the quarter.

There were no transfers of securities available-for-sale to held-to-maturity during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. During the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no sales of securities and no gains or losses were recognized.  There was no other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, securities with an aggregate fair value of $287.4   million and $291.6 million were pledged as collateral for deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limits for various municipalities placing deposits with Greene County Commercial Bank.  As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, securities with an aggregate fair value of $4.1 million and $4.2 million, respectively, were pledged as collateral for potential borrowings at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window.  Greene County Bancorp, Inc. did not participate in any securities lending programs during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock

Federal law requires a member institution of the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) system to hold stock of its district FHLB according to a predetermined formula.  This stock is restricted in that it can only be sold to the FHLB or to another member institution, and all sales of FHLB stock must be at par.  As a result of these restrictions, FHLB stock is carried at cost.  FHLB stock is held as a long-term investment and its value is determined based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value.  Impairment of this investment is evaluated quarterly and is a matter of judgment that reflects management s view of the FHLB s long-term performance, which includes factors such as the following:   its operating performance; the severity and duration of declines in the fair value of its net assets related to its capital stock amount; its commitment to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to its operating performance; the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on the FHLB, and accordingly, on the members of the FHLB; and its liquidity and funding position.  After evaluating these considerations, Greene County Bancorp, Inc. concluded that the par value of its investment in FHLB stock will be recovered and, therefore, no other-than-temporary impairment charge was recorded during the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

 Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses

Loan segments and classes at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 are summarized as follows:

Management closely monitors the quality of the loan portfolio and has established a loan review process designed to help grade the quality and profitability of the Company s loan portfolio.  The credit quality grade helps management make a consistent assessment of each loan relationship s credit risk. Consistent with regulatory guidelines, The Bank of Greene County provides for the classification of loans considered being of lesser quality.  Such ratings coincide with the  Substandard,   Doubtful  and  Loss  classifications used by federal regulators in their examination of financial institutions. Generally, an asset is considered Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured financial institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in assets classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as Loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a full loss reserve and/or charge-off is not warranted. Assets that do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but otherwise possess weaknesses are designated  Special Mention.    Management also maintains a listing of loans designated  Watch.  These loans represent borrowers with declining earnings, strained cash flow, increasing leverage and/or weakening market fundamentals that indicate above average risk.

When The Bank of Greene County classifies problem assets as either Substandard or Doubtful, it generally establishes a specific valuation allowance or  loss reserve  in an amount deemed prudent by management.  General allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular loans.  When The Bank of Greene County identifies problem loans as being impaired, it is required to evaluate whether the Bank will be able to collect all amounts due either through repayments or the liquidation of the underlying collateral.  If it is determined that impairment exists, the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to the amount of impairment of the assets, or to charge-off such amount.  The Bank of Greene County s determination as to the classification of its loans and the amount of its valuation allowance is subject to review by its regulatory agencies, which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.  The Bank of Greene County reviews its portfolio monthly to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. 

The Bank primarily has four segments within its loan portfolio that it considers when measuring credit quality: residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, consumer loans and commercial loans.  The residential real estate portfolio consists of residential, construction, and multifamily loan classes. Commercial real estate loans consist of commercial real estate and commercial construction loan classes. Consumer loans consist of home equity loan and consumer installment loan classes. The inherent risk within the loan portfolio varies depending upon each of these loan types.

The Bank of Greene County s primary lending activity is the origination of residential mortgage loans, including home equity loans, which are collateralized by residences.   Generally, residential mortgage loans are made in amounts up to 89.9% of the appraised value of the property.  However, The Bank of Greene County will originate residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 95.0%, with private mortgage insurance.  In the event of default by the borrower, The Bank of Greene County will acquire and liquidate the underlying collateral. By originating the loan at a loan-to-value ratio of 89.9% or less or obtaining private mortgage insurance, The Bank of Greene County limits its risk of loss in the event of default.  However, the market values of the collateral may be adversely impacted by declines in the economy.  Home equity loans may have an additional inherent risk if The Bank of Greene County does not hold the first mortgage.  The Bank of Greene County may stand in a secondary position in the event of collateral liquidation resulting in a greater chance of insufficiency to meet all obligations.

Index 

Construction lending generally involves a greater degree of risk than other residential mortgage lending.  The repayment of the construction loan is, to a great degree, dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the construction of the subject property within specified cost limits.  The Bank of Greene County completes inspections during the construction phase prior to any disbursements.  The Bank of Greene County limits its risk during the construction as disbursements are not made until the required work for each advance has been completed.  Construction delays may further impair the borrower s ability to repay the loan.

Loans collateralized by commercial real estate, and multi-family dwellings, such as apartment buildings generally are larger than residential loans and involve a greater degree of risk. Commercial real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Payments on these loans depend to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties or underlying businesses, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Accordingly, the nature of commercial real estate loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate.

Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans. In addition, consumer loans expand the products and services offered by The Bank of Greene County to better meet the financial services needs of its customers.  Consumer loans generally involve greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because of the difference in the nature of the underlying collateral.  Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation in the underlying collateral. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrower s personal financial stability.  Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.

Commercial lending generally involves greater risk than residential mortgage lending and involves risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate mortgage lending. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral-based, with loan amounts based on fixed loan-to-collateral values, and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial loans may be collateralized by equipment or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficient source of repayment because equipment and other business assets may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment.

Loan balances by internal credit quality indicator as of June 30, 2016 are shown below.

The Company had no loans classified Doubtful or Loss at September 30, 2016 or June 30, 2016.

Nonaccrual Loans 

Management places loans on nonaccrual status once the loans have become 90 days or more delinquent.  A nonaccrual loan is defined as a loan in which collectability is questionable and therefore interest on the loan will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis.  A loan is not placed back on accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and willingness to make timely payments on the loan.  A loan does not have to be 90 days delinquent in order to be classified as nonaccrual.   Nonaccrual loans consisted primarily of loans secured by real estate at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Loans on nonaccrual status totaled $4.2 million at September 30, 2016, of which $1.7 million were in the process of foreclosure. At September 30, 2016, there were 11 residential loans in the process of foreclosure totaling $1.1 million. Included in nonaccrual loans were $1.9 million of loans which were less than 90 days past due at September 30, 2016, but have a recent history of delinquency greater than 90 days past due. These loans will be returned to accrual status once they have demonstrated a history of timely payments.  Included in total loans past due were $75,000 of loans which were making payments pursuant to forbearance agreements.  Under the forbearance agreements, the customers have made arrangements with the Bank to bring the loans current over a specified period of time (resulting in an insignificant delay in repayment).  During this term of the forbearance agreement, the Bank has agreed not to continue foreclosure proceedings.  Loans on nonaccrual status totaled $3.3 million at June 30, 2016 of which $1.5 million were in the process of foreclosure. At June 30, 2016, there were nine residential loans in the process of foreclosure totaling $867,000. Included in nonaccrual loans were $1.9 million of loans which were less than 90 days past due at June 30, 2016, but have a recent history of delinquency greater than 90 days past due.

The following table sets forth information regarding delinquent and/or nonaccrual loans as of June 30, 2016:

The Bank of Greene County had accruing loans delinquent more than 90 days totaling $75,000 and $84,000 as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  The loans delinquent more than 90 days and accruing consist of loans that are well collateralized and the borrowers have demonstrated the ability and willingness to pay.  The borrower has made arrangements with the Bank to bring the loan current within a specified time period and has made a series of payments as agreed.

The table below details additional information related to nonaccrual loans for the three months ended September 30:

Impaired Loan Analysis 

The Company identifies impaired loans and measures the impairment in accordance with FASB ASC subtopic   Receivables   Loan Impairment.    Management may consider a loan impaired once it is classified as nonaccrual and when it is probable that the borrower will be unable to repay the loan according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is restructured in a troubled debt restructuring.  It should be noted that management does not evaluate all loans individually for impairment.  Generally, The Bank of Greene County considers residential mortgages, home equity loans and installment loans as small, homogeneous loans, which are evaluated for impairment collectively based on historical loan experience and other factors.  In contrast, large commercial mortgage, construction, multi-family, business loans and select larger balance residential mortgage loans are reviewed individually and considered impaired if it is probable that The Bank of Greene County will not be able to collect scheduled payments of principal and interest when due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  The measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.  The majority of The Bank of Greene County loans, including most nonaccrual loans, are small homogenous loan types adequately supported by collateral.  Management considers the payment status of loans in the process of evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses among other factors.  Based on this evaluation, a delinquent loan s risk rating may be downgraded to either pass-watch, special mention, or substandard, and the allocation of the allowance for loan loss is based upon the risk associated with such designation.  Loans that have been modified as a troubled debt restructuring are included in impaired loans.  The measurement of impairment is generally based on the discounted cash flows based on the original rate of the loan before the restructuring, unless it is determined that the restructured loan is collateral dependent.  If the restructured loan is deemed to be collateral dependent, impairment is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.

There were no loans that have been modified as a troubled debt restructuring during the three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.

Index 

There were no loans that had been modified as a troubled debt restructuring during the twelve months prior to June 30, 2016 or 2015 which have subsequently defaulted during the three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015, respectively.

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, the composition of the loan portfolio, specific impaired loans and current economic conditions.  Such evaluation, which includes a review of certain identified loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters, the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, payment status of the loan, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for the loan loss allowance.  In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review The Bank of Greene County s allowance for loan losses.  Such agencies may require The Bank of Greene County to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. The Bank of Greene County considers smaller balance residential mortgages, home equity loans, commercial loans and installment loans to customers as small, homogeneous loans, which are evaluated for impairment collectively based on historical loss experience.  Larger balance residential, commercial mortgage and business loans are viewed individually and considered impaired if it is probable that The Bank of Greene County will not be able to collect scheduled payments of principal and interest when due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements.  The measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.  The Bank of Greene County charges loans off against the allowance for credit losses when it becomes evident that a loan cannot be collected within a reasonable amount of time or that it will cost the Bank more than it will receive, and all possible avenues of repayment have been analyzed, including the potential of future cash flow, the value of the underlying collateral, and strength of any guarantors or co-borrowers.  Generally, consumer loans and smaller business loans (not secured by real estate) in excess of 90 days are charged-off against the allowance for loan losses, unless equitable arrangements are made.   For loans secured by real estate, a charge-off is recorded when it is determined that the collection of all or a portion of a loan may not be collected and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated.

The following tables set forth the activity and allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category during and at the periods indicated.  The allowance is allocated to each loan category based on historical loss experience and economic conditions.

 Fair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company s financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique.  Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in a sale transaction on the dates indicated.  The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of these consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates.  As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each period-end.

The following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of the Company s assets and liabilities.  Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company s disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful.

The FASB ASC Topic on   Fair Value Measurement   established a fair value hierarchy that prioritized the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported with little or no market activity).

An asset s or liability s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

For assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy used are as follows: 

20 

Index 

Certain investments that are actively traded and have quoted market prices have been classified as Level 1 valuations.  Other available-for-sale investment securities have been valued by reference to prices for similar securities or through model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable and, therefore, such valuations have been classified as Level 2.

In addition to disclosures of the fair value of assets on a recurring basis, FASB ASC Topic on   Fair Value Measurement   requires disclosures for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired assets, in the period in which a re-measurement at fair value is performed.  Loans are generally not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Periodically, the Company records nonrecurring adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurements for partial charge-offs of the uncollectible portions of those loans. Nonrecurring adjustments also include certain impairment amounts for collateral-dependent loans calculated as required by the   Receivables  Loan Impairment   subtopic of the FASB ASC when establishing the allowance for credit losses.  Impaired loans are those loans for which the Company has measured impairment generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and, as a result, the carrying value of the loan less the calculated valuation amount may not necessarily represent the actual fair value of the loan. Real estate collateral is typically valued using independent appraisals or other indications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally observable in the marketplace and the related nonrecurring fair value measurement adjustments have generally been classified as Level 3. Estimates of fair value used for other collateral supporting commercial loans generally are based on assumptions not observable in the marketplace and therefore such valuations have been classified as Level 3.

21 

Index 

The following table presents additional quantitative information about assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and for which Level 3 inputs were utilized to determine fair value:

(1)  
 
 Fair value is generally determined through independent third-party appraisals of the underlying collateral, which generally includes various Level 3 inputs which are not observable.

(2)  
 
 Appraisals may be adjusted downwards by management for qualitative factors such as economic conditions.  Higher downward adjustments are caused by negative changes to the collateral or conditions in the real estate market, actual offers or sales contracts received or age of the appraisal.

(3)  
 
 Appraisals are adjusted downwards by management for qualitative factors such as the estimated costs to liquidate the collateral.

The carrying amounts reported in the statements of financial condition for cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable approximate their fair values.  Fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices (Level 1), where available, or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique, used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted prices.  The carrying amount of Federal Home Loan Bank stock approximates fair value due to its restricted nature.  Fair values for variable rate loans that reprice frequently, with no significant credit risk, are based on carrying value.  Fair value for fixed rate loans are estimated using discounted cash flows and interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.  Fair values disclosed for demand and savings deposits are equal to carrying amounts at the reporting date.  The carrying amounts for variable rate money market deposits approximate fair values at the reporting date.  Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using discounted cash flows and interest rates currently being offered in the market on similar certificates.  Fair value for Federal Home Loan Bank long term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flows and interest rates currently being offered on similar borrowings.  The carrying value of short-term Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings approximates its fair value.

The fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated based on an analysis of the interest rates and fees currently charged to enter into similar transactions, considering the remaining terms of the commitments and the credit-worthiness of the potential borrowers.  At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the estimated fair values of these off-balance sheet financial instruments were immaterial, and are therefore excluded from the table below.

The carrying amounts and estimated fair value of financial instruments are as follows:

 Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share is computed in a manner similar to that of basic earnings per share except that the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding is increased to include the number of incremental common shares that would have been outstanding under the treasury stock method if all potentially dilutive common shares (such as stock options) issued became vested during the period.  There were no anti-dilutive securities or contracts outstanding during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  On February 17, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has declared a 2-for-1 stock split on the Company s common stock.  The stock split was paid on March 15, 2016 to stockholders of record as of March 7, 2016.   Weighted-average number of shares outstanding and earnings per share have been restated for September 30, 2015 as if the new shares had been issued and outstanding at the same time as the original shares.

 Dividends

On July 19, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 of $0.095 per share on Greene County Bancorp, Inc. s common stock.  The dividend reflects an annual cash dividend rate of $0.38 per share, compared to an annual cash dividend rate of $0.37 declared during the previous quarter.  The dividend was payable to stockholders of record as of August 15, 2016, and was paid on August 31, 2016.  The MHC has waived its right to receive dividends declared on its shares of the Company s common stock for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.

 Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an Accounting Standard Update ( ASU) (ASU 2014-09) to amend its guidance on  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  The objective of the ASU is to align the recognition of revenue with the transfer of promised goods or services provided to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP when it becomes effective. In August, 2015, the FASB issued an amendment (ASU 2015-14) which defers the effective date of this new guidance by one year. More detailed implementation guidance on Topic 606 was issued in March 2016 (ASU 2016-08), April 2016 (ASU 2016-10) and May 2016 (ASU 2016-12), and the effective date and transition requirements for these ASUs are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09.  The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for public business entities for annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company has not yet determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.

Index 

In August 2014, the FASB issued an amendment (ASU 2014-14) to its guidance on  Receivables   Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40) .  The objective of the ASU is to reduce the diversity in how creditors classify government-guaranteed mortgage loans, including FHA or VA guaranteed loans, upon foreclosure, to provide more decision-useful information about a creditor s foreclosed mortgage loans that are expected to be recovered, at least in part, through government guarantees.  The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Public entities would be permitted to elect to early adopt for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

In January 2015, the FASB issued an Update (ASU 2015-01) to its guidance on  Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20) .  The objective of the ASU is to simplify the income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items, and will align GAAP more closely with International Accounting Standards which prohibits the presentation and disclosure of extraordinary items.  The amendments in this Update were effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

In January 2016, the FASB issued an Update (ASU 2016-01) to its guidance on  Financial Instruments (Subtopic 825-10) .  This amendment addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.  These amendments require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value to be recognized through net income. The amendments also simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring assessment for impairment qualitatively at each reporting period.  For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption of the amendments in this Update is not permitted.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

In February 2016, the FASB issued an Update (ASU 2016-02) to its guidance on  Leases (Topic 842) .  The new leases standard applies a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record, for all leases with a lease term of more than 12 months, an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a liability to make lease payments. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a practical expedient is available whereby a lessee may elect, by class of underlying asset, not to recognize an ROU asset or lease liability. The new leases standard requires a lessor to classify leases as either sales-type, direct financing or operating, similar to existing U.S. GAAP. Classification depends on the same five criteria used by lessees plus certain additional factors. The subsequent accounting treatment for all three lease types is substantially equivalent to existing U.S. GAAP for sales-type leases, direct financing leases, and operating leases. However, the new standard updates certain aspects of the lessor accounting model to align it with the new lessee accounting model, as well as with the new revenue standard under Topic 606. Lessees and lessors are required to provide certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued an Update (ASU 2016-09) to its guidance on  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .  This amendment is intended to simplify the accounting for stock compensation.  The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

In June 2016, the FASB issued an Update (ASU 2016-13) to its guidance on  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires credit losses on most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments to be measured using an expected credit loss model (referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model). Under this model, entities will estimate credit losses over the entire contractual term of the instrument (considering estimated prepayments, but not expected extensions or modifications unless reasonable expectation of a troubled debt restructuring exists) from the date of initial recognition of that instrument. The ASU also replaces the current accounting model for purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities. The allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination ( PCD assets ), should be determined in a similar manner to other financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis. However, upon initial recognition, the allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price ( gross up approach ) to determine the initial amortized cost basis. The subsequent accounting for PCD financial assets is the same expected loss model described above. Further, the ASU made certain targeted amendments to the existing impairment model for available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities. For an AFS debt security for which there is neither the intent nor a more-likely-than-not requirement to sell, an entity will record credit losses as an allowance rather than a write-down of the amortized cost basis.  For public business entities that are U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filers, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. All entities may adopt the amendments in this Update earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity will apply the amendments in this Update through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach).  The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation

Overview of the Company s Activities and Risks

Greene County Bancorp, Inc. s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on Greene County Bancorp, Inc. s loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds, consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected by Greene County Bancorp, Inc. s provision for loan losses, gains and losses from sales of securities, noninterest income and noninterest expense.  Noninterest income consists primarily of fees and service charges.  Greene County Bancorp, Inc. s noninterest expense consists principally of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment and data processing, and other operating expenses. Results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, changes in interest rates, as well as government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Additionally, future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially affect Greene County Bancorp, Inc.

To operate successfully, the Company must manage various types of risk, including but not limited to, market or interest rate risk, credit risk, transaction risk, liquidity risk, security risk, strategic risk, reputation risk and compliance risk.  While all of these risks are important, the risks of greatest significance to the Company relate to market or interest rate risk and credit risk.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and/or interest rates.  Since net interest income (the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings) is the Company s primary source of revenue, interest rate risk is the most significant non-credit related market risk to which the Company is exposed.  Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of the Company s assets and liabilities.

Interest rate risk is the exposure of the Company s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates.  In addition to directly impacting net interest income, changes in interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations, the ability of borrowers and debt issuers to repay loans and debt securities, the volume of loan repayments and refinancings, and the flow and mix of deposits.

Credit risk is the risk to the Company s earnings and shareholders  equity that results from customers, to whom loans have been made and to the issuers of debt securities in which the Company has invested, failing to repay their obligations.  The magnitude of risk depends on the capacity and willingness of borrowers and debt issuers to repay and the sufficiency of the value of collateral obtained to secure the loans made or investments purchased.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Regulation G, a rule adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), applies to certain SEC filings, including earnings releases, made by registered companies that contain  non-GAAP financial measures.   GAAP is generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.  Under Regulation G, companies making public disclosures containing non-GAAP financial measures must also disclose, along with each non-GAAP financial measure, certain additional information, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the closest comparable GAAP financial measure (if a comparable GAAP measure exists) and a statement of the Company s reasons for utilizing the non-GAAP financial measure as part of its financial disclosures.  The SEC has exempted from the definition of  non-GAAP financial measures  certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP.  When these exempted measures are included in public disclosures, supplemental information is not required. Financial institutions like the Company and its subsidiary banks are subject to an array of bank regulatory capital measures that are financial in nature but are not based on GAAP and are not easily reconcilable to the closest comparable GAAP financial measures, even in those cases where a comparable measure exists. The Company follows industry practice in disclosing its financial condition under these various regulatory capital measures, including period-end regulatory capital ratios for itself and its subsidiary banks, in its periodic reports filed with the SEC, and does so without compliance with Regulation G, on the widely-shared assumption that the SEC regards such non-GAAP measures to be exempt from Regulation G.  The Company uses in this Report additional non-GAAP financial measures that are commonly utilized by financial institutions and have not been specifically exempted by the SEC from Regulation G. The Company provides, as supplemental information, such non-GAAP measures included in this Report as described immediately below.

Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin:  Net interest income, as a component of the tabular presentation by financial institutions of Selected Financial Information regarding their recently completed operations, as well as disclosures based on that tabular presentation, is commonly presented on a tax-equivalent basis.  That is, to the extent that some component of the institution's net interest income, which is presented on a before-tax basis, is exempt from taxation (e.g., is received by the institution as a result of its holdings of state or municipal obligations), an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from that component is added to the actual before-tax net interest income total.  This adjustment is considered helpful in comparing one financial institution's net interest income to that of another institution or in analyzing any institution s net interest income trend line over time, to correct any analytical distortion that might otherwise arise from the fact that financial institutions vary widely in the proportions of their portfolios that are invested in tax-exempt securities, and that even a single institution may significantly alter over time the proportion of its own portfolio that is invested in tax-exempt obligations.  Moreover, net interest income is itself a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions, net interest margin, which is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets.  For purposes of this measure as well, tax-equivalent net interest income is generally used by financial institutions, again to provide a better basis of comparison from institution to institution and to better demonstrate a single institution s performance over time. While we present net interest income and net interest margin utilizing GAAP measures (no tax-equivalent adjustments) as a component of the tabular presentation within our disclosures, we do provide as supplemental information net interest income and net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis.

Comparison of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016

ASSETS

Total assets of the Company were $893.1 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $868.8 million at June 30, 2016, an increase of $24.3 million, or 2.8%.  Securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity amounted to $298.8 million, or 33.5% of assets, at September 30, 2016 as compared to $305.1 million, or 35.1% of assets, at June 30, 2016, a decrease of $6.3 million, or 2.1%.   Net loans grew by $26.1 million, or 5.0%, to $548.9 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $522.8 million at June 30, 2016.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Total cash and cash equivalents increased $4.1 million to $20.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $15.9 million at June 30, 2016.  The level of cash and cash equivalents is a function of the daily account clearing needs and deposit levels as well as activities associated with securities transactions and loan funding.  All of these items can cause cash levels to fluctuate significantly on a daily basis.

SECURITIES

Securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity decreased $6.3 million, or 2.1%, to $298.8 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $305.1 million at June 30, 2016.  Securities purchases totaled $24.1 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and consisted of state and political subdivision securities. Principal pay-downs and maturities during the quarter amounted to $29.9 million, of which $2.2 million were mortgage-backed securities, and $27.7 million were state and political subdivision securities. At September 30, 2016, 52.1% of our securities portfolio consisted of state and political subdivision securities to take advantage of tax savings and to promote Greene County Bancorp, Inc. s participation in the communities in which it operates. Mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities held within the portfolio do not contain sub-prime loans and are not exposed to the credit risk associated with such lending.

LOANS

Net loans receivable increased $26.1 million, or 5.0%, to $548.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $522.8 million at June 30, 2016.  The loan growth experienced during the quarter consisted primarily of $17.8 million in commercial real estate loans, $5.3 million in commercial construction loans, and $3.6 million in commercial loans. Balances within all other loan categories were relatively flat when comparing September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  We believe that the continued low interest rate environment and strong customer satisfaction from personal service continued to enhance loan growth. If long term rates begin to rise, the Company anticipates some slowdown in new loan demand as well as refinancing activities.  The Bank of Greene County continues to use a conservative underwriting policy in regard to all loan originations, and does not engage in sub-prime lending or other exotic loan products.  A significant decline in home values, however, in the Company s markets could have a negative effect on the consolidated results of operations, as any such decline in home values would likely lead to a decrease in residential real estate loans and new home equity loan originations and increased delinquencies and defaults in both the consumer home equity loan and the residential real estate loan portfolios and result in increased losses in these portfolios.  Updated appraisals are obtained on loans when there is a reason to believe that there has been a change in the borrower s ability to repay the loan principal and interest, generally, when a loan is in a delinquent status.  Additionally, if an existing loan is to be modified or refinanced, generally, an appraisal is ordered to ensure continued collateral adequacy.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio, the composition of the loan portfolio, specific impaired loans and current economic conditions.  Such evaluation, which includes a review of certain identified loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters, the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, payment status of the loan, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an allowance for loan loss.  In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review The Bank of Greene County s allowance for loan losses.  Such agencies may require The Bank of Greene County to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination.  The Bank of Greene County considers smaller balance residential mortgages, home equity loans and installment loans to customers as small, homogeneous loans, which are evaluated for impairment collectively based on historical loss experience.  Larger balance residential and commercial mortgage and business loans are viewed individually and considered impaired if it is probable that The Bank of Greene County will not be able to collect scheduled payments of principal and interest when due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements.  The measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. The Bank of Greene County charges loans off against the allowance for loan losses when it becomes evident that a loan cannot be collected within a reasonable amount of time or that it will cost the Bank more than it will receive, and all possible avenues of repayment have been analyzed, including the potential of future cash flow, the value of the underlying collateral, and strength of any guarantors or co-borrowers.  Generally, consumer loans and smaller business loans (not secured by real estate) in excess of 90 days are charged-off against the allowance for loan losses, unless equitable arrangements are made.  For loans secured by real estate, a charge-off is recorded when it is determined that the collection of all or a portion of a loan may not be collected and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. The allowance for loan losses is increased by a provision for loan losses (which results in a charge to expense) and recoveries of loans previously charged off and is reduced by charge-offs.

Analysis of allowance for loan losses activity 

Nonaccrual Loans and Nonperforming Assets 

Loans are reviewed on a regular basis to assess collectability of all principal and interest payments due.  Management determines that a loan is impaired or nonperforming when it is probable at least a portion of the principal or interest will not be collected in accordance with contractual terms of the note.  When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan is based on present value of estimated future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral.

Generally, management places loans on nonaccrual status once the loans have become 90 days or more delinquent or sooner if there is a significant reason for management to believe the collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on the loan will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis.  The Company identifies impaired loans and measures the impairment in accordance with FASB ASC subtopic   Receivables   Loan Impairment.    Management may consider a loan impaired once it is classified as nonaccrual and when it is probable that the borrower will be unable to repay the loan according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is restructured in a troubled debt restructuring.  It should be noted that management does not evaluate all loans individually for impairment.  Generally, The Bank of Greene County considers residential mortgages, home equity loans and installment loans as small, homogeneous loans, which are evaluated for impairment collectively based on historical loan experience and other factors.  In contrast, large commercial mortgage, construction, multi-family, business loans and select larger balance residential mortgage loans are viewed individually and considered impaired if it is probable that The Bank of Greene County will not be able to collect scheduled payments of principal and interest when due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  The measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.  The majority of The Bank of Greene County loans, including most nonaccrual loans, are small homogenous loan types adequately supported by collateral.  Management considers the payment status of loans in the process of evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses among other factors.  Based on this evaluation, a delinquent loan s risk rating may be downgraded to either pass-watch, special mention, or substandard, and the allocation of the allowance for loan loss is based upon the risk associated with such designation. A loan does not have to be 90 days delinquent in order to be classified as nonperforming.  Foreclosed real estate is considered to be a nonperforming asset.

Analysis of Nonaccrual Loans and Nonperforming Assets 

The table below details additional information related to nonaccrual loans for the three months ended September 30:

Nonperforming assets amounted to $4.6 million at September 30, 2016 and $3.8 million as of June 30, 2016, an increase of $809,000 or 21.4%. Nonaccrual loans consisted primarily of loans secured by real estate at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Loans on nonaccrual status totaled $4.2 million at September 30, 2016, of which $1.7 million were in the process of foreclosure. At September 30, 2016, there were 11 residential loans in the process of foreclosure totaling $1.1 million. Included in nonaccrual loans were $1.9 million of loans which were less than 90 days past due at September 30, 2016, but have a recent history of delinquency greater than 90 days past due. These loans will be returned to accrual status once they have demonstrated a history of timely payments.  Included in total loans past due were $75,000 of loans which were making payments pursuant to forbearance agreements.  Under the forbearance agreements, the customers have made arrangements with the Bank to bring the loans current over a specified period of time (resulting in an insignificant delay in repayment).  During this term of the forbearance agreement, the Bank has agreed not to continue foreclosure proceedings.  While the Bank makes every reasonable effort to work with the borrowers to collect amounts due, the number of loans in process of foreclosure has grown substantially over the past several years.  The growth in nonperforming assets is also due in part to the extended length of time required to meet all of the legal requirements mandated by New York State law prior to a foreclosure sale, which may be in excess of two years.

These increases were the result of a $36.4 million increase in municipal deposits at Greene County Commercial Bank, primarily from continued growth in new account relationships as well as tax collection.  Included within certificates of deposits at June 30, 2016 were $10.0 million in brokered certificates of deposit. These brokered certificates of deposit matured during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

BORROWINGS

At September 30, 2016, The Bank of Greene County had pledged approximately $216.7 million of its residential mortgage portfolio as collateral for borrowing and stand-by letters of credit at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ( FHLB ).

The Bank of Greene County has established an Irrevocable Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement with the FHLB, whereby upon The Bank of Greene County s request, on behalf of Greene County Commercial Bank, an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit is issued to secure municipal transactional deposit accounts.  At September 30, 2016, there were no outstanding letters of credit.

The Bank of Greene County also pledges securities as collateral at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window for overnight borrowings.

GENERAL

Return on average assets and return on average equity are common methods of measuring operating results.  Annualized return on average assets remained unchanged at 1.16% for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Annualized return on average equity increased to 13.32% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 12.70% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in return on average equity was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income resulting from growth in earning assets, resulting in higher net income.  Net income amounted to $2.5 million and $2.2 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Average assets increased $122.1 million, or 16.4% to $865.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $743.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.

INTEREST INCOME

Interest income amounted to $7.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $6.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $951,000, or 13.9%.  The increase in average loan and securities balances had the greatest impact on interest income when comparing the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, which was offset by a decrease in the yield on loans and securities. Average loan balances increased $83.8 million while the yield on loans decreased 15 basis points when comparing the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   Average securities increased $38.8 million and the yield on such securities decreased 6 basis points when comparing the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest expense amounted to $727,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $614,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $113,000 or 18.4%.  Increases in the average balances on interest-bearing liabilities and an increase in the rate paid contributed to the increase in interest expense.  As illustrated in the rate/volume table, interest expense increased $123,000 due to a $97.9 million increase in the average balances on interest-bearing liabilities.  The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 1 basis point to 0.42% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.41% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The average balance of NOW deposits grew by $58.0 million when comparing the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The average balance of savings and money market deposits increased $20.7 million and average balance of certificates of deposit remained unchanged when comparing the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The average balance on borrowings increased $19.2 million, and the rate decreased 13 basis points when comparing the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income increased $838,000 to $7.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $6.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Net interest spread decreased 12 basis points to 3.26% as compared to 3.38% when comparing the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Net interest margin decreased 11 basis points to 3.34% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 3.45% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The growth in average loan and securities balances, led to an increase in net interest income when comparing the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis includes the additional amount of interest income that would have been earned if the Company s investment in tax-exempt securities and loans had been subject to federal and New York State income taxes yielding the same after-tax income. Tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.59% and 3.69% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Due to the large portion of fixed-rate residential mortgages in the Company s portfolio, interest rate risk is a concern and the Company will continue to monitor and adjust the asset and liability mix as much as possible to take advantage of the benefits and reduce the risks or potential negative effects of a rising rate environment.  Management attempts to mitigate the interest rate risk through balance sheet composition.  Several strategies are used to help manage interest rate risk such as maintaining a high level of liquid assets such as short-term federal funds sold and various investment securities and maintaining a high concentration of less interest-rate sensitive and lower-costing core deposits.

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES

Management continues to closely monitor asset quality and adjust the level of the allowance for loan losses when necessary.  The amount recognized for the provision for loan losses is determined by management based on its ongoing analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.  The provision for loan losses amounted to $543,000 and $374,000 for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The level of provision has increased as the result of continued growth in commercial real estate and commercial loans.  Allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable were 1.79% as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  Nonperforming loans amounted to $4.3 million and $3.4 million at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  Net charge-offs amounted to $52,000 and $50,000 for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $2,000.   At September 30, 2016, nonperforming assets were 0.51% of total assets and nonperforming loans were 0.78% of net loans.   The Company has not been an originator of  no documentation  mortgage loans, and the loan portfolio does not include any mortgage loans that the Company classifies as sub-prime.

Index 

NONINTEREST INCOME

Noninterest income increased $65,000, or 4.4%, and totaled $1.5 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, primarily due to increases in service charges and debit card fees resulting from continued growth in the number of checking accounts with debit cards.  These increases were partially offset by lower sales commissions earned in investment services and lower other operating income.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

Noninterest expense increased $196,000, or 4.3%, to $4.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $4.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses, resulting from additional staffing within our lending department and customer service center.  Partially offsetting the aforementioned increases were decreases in legal and professional fees and lower expenses related to foreclosed real estate included in other expenses.

INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes directly reflects the expected tax associated with the pre-tax income generated for the given year and certain regulatory requirements.  The effective tax rate was 24.9% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to 23.2% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.   The effective tax rate is impacted by the benefits derived from tax exempt bond and loan income, the Company s real estate investment trust subsidiary income, as well as the tax benefits derived from premiums paid to the Company s pooled captive insurance subsidiary.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices.  Greene County Bancorp, Inc. s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk since the majority of Greene County Bancorp, Inc. s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  Greene County Bancorp, Inc. s primary sources of funds are deposits and proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage-backed securities and debt securities, with lines of credit available through the Federal Home Loan Bank and Atlantic Central Bankers Bank as needed.  While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit outflows, mortgage prepayments, and lending activities are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the  Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and in timely altering them to material information relating to the Company (or its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be filed in its periodic SEC filings.

There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting in connection with the quarterly evaluation that occurred during the Company's last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
